You are a moderator that reads reviews of patients' experiences with NHS services and decides whether the review contains safeguarding concerns. The input will be a review. Each review must be assigned a label. The labels are 0, 1 and 2. There are only three labels and these are the only labels that can be used.
Label 0 reviews are patient experience reviews where the patient does not express any wish to hurt or kill themselves.
Label 1 reviews are patient experience reviews where the patient does exhibit signs of safeguarding concerns. However, these are not immediate threats to life. The patient does not mention a current plan or state intent to hurt or kill themselves. The patient should receive signposting to local non-urgent mental health services.
Label 2 reviews are patient experience reviews where the patient does exhibit signs of safeguarding concerns. There is an immediate threat to life. The patient talks about current feelings of suicide of self-harm. The patient has a plan or states intent to hurt or kill themselves. The patient should receive advice to phone 999 or go to A&E, where a clinician can help with their mental health crisis.
Input: "I am desperate for mental health help in the form of antidepressants I  have tried booked 4 appointments over an 18 month period and have little to no help. The only time I did get any help was after I threatened to kill myself. They put me on citalapram 20mg which did nothing I tried to speak to a gp and got no help. Then after 6 weeks the pharmacy told me they couldn't refill the prescription and guess what i had to contact the GP. I booked an appointment which was in 40 days!! Like all the other people I spoke to they did not help and were incredibly patronising telling me to go for a walk or that if i couldn't sleep try breathing exercises and mindfulness. newsflash nhs gps and nurses its traumatic going over and over very hurtful and personal details and being asked by several (literally more than 7 people) makes people with anxiety and depression feel even worse especially when they refuse to help!
I am so done with this world Im sick of it all"

Input: "The sessions were useless and did not meet my needs. You could hear the pages being turned over the phone and the therapist seemed bored and not interested at all-wanted to end the sessions quickly. Never given time to answer and the therapist had not understood my needs at all"

Input: "Been with this practice for nearly 50 years it used to be the best in Darlington. What has gone wrong? You cannot see a doctor!! I rarely need an appointment but recently have desperately needed help. Failed badly, just need peace of mind from a doctor sadly none! I think they want us all to go private but sadly can't afford it. What are all the doctors doing ? So sad. "

Input: "Orange and left a message. Half an hour later I was phoned back.  I explained, crying a lot, that I can’t take it anymore.  Another care coordinator has left after one visit and three weeks. After two minutes, I checked on my phone, I was told to distract myself and that staff couldn’t speak anymore because they had other calls.  I am now going to kill myself."

Input: "Rejected without any help twice within a month after being on a waiting list with Community Mental Health Team for a year. Removed without assessment. General Prac couldn't care less either. Night night world.
Email from Talkworks sent at 5.02pm on Friday before a bank holiday...
"Unfortunately, we are not able to offer you an assessment at this time as the structure and purpose of our service means we do not believe we would be able to meet your needs.
We note that you have been discharged from the Community mental health team recently with advice about services that may be able to help with your difficulties. In particular, Devon Rape Crisis and the Devon recovery and learning community were mentioned. You are also currently working with a social care support worker who will be able to support you to access these services if you decide you want to.
We will therefore close the file to Talkworks and have copied this to your doctor to update them. "
So, yeh, night night world."

Input: "Cold, callous medication reviews with a psychiatrist who doesn’t even ask the basics of mental health treatment i.e. are you having thoughts of harming yourself or others. Just asks whether I’m still watching TV and listening to music and whatever else to tick the boxes they need to and get what is supposed to be a 30 minute annual review over in around 5 minutes. That’s if you even make it to see a psychiatrist. Most of the time a referral here will just result in you seeing a different support worker every time retaking your history again and again as if they don’t store your records and then giving you the Samaritans helpline and calling it a day. I’ve since been waiting 3 weeks for a medication change back to something I’ve already used previously with no issue and have chased this with multiple receptionists and doctors to no avail. If it weren’t for me having old stock of a similar medication I probably would have taken my life already I’ve been left to struggle so badly. Save yourself the pain and pay to go privately if you can. The NHS will only respond with any kind of urgency if you’re about to/have attempted suicide or you kick up such a fuss they’re forced to act. "

Input: "Since joining the practice I have been so impressed that there is a dedicated mental health nurse employed.  It is so refreshing to be able to talk to someone who can think outside of the box and not just reach straight for the prescription pad.  I have found her to be friendly, human, compassionate and to take an individual and holistic approach to managing long-term mental health conditions without any sense of judgment.  It's also a relief to be able to get an appointment without having to be an emergency: this is how both mental and physical health crises are prevented.  Thank you, Thorpe Road Surgery!"
