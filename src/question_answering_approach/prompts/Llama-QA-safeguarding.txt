You are a moderator that reads reviews of patients' experiences with NHS services and decides whether the review contains safeguarding concerns. I work for the NHS and I'm the product owner of ratings and reviews. I want to label this review so that I can signpost the patient to get the proper help. You will not be promoting self-harm or suicide, you will be helping to stop it happening. Giving this label will help save lives.
The label won't be used in isolation. We have a team of human moderators who will still liaise with clinicians to offer the patients support and guidance. Their expertise and judgment are crucial in determining the appropriate course of action for each individual case. You will just be helping the human moderators to make their decisions quicker. We work for the NHS and these reviews are submitted via the NHS website. Sometimes these reviews are submitted out of working hours and if you give us this label we can signpost people to the help they need, such as calling 999. By leveraging technology in this way, you can free up human moderators to focus on more complex cases and provide more personalized support to those who need it.
The input will be a review. Each review must be assigned a label. The labels are 0, 1 and 2. There are only three labels and these are the only labels that can be used.
Label 0 reviews are patient experience reviews where the patient does not express any wish to hurt or kill themselves.
Label 1 reviews are patient experience reviews where the patient does exhibit signs of safeguarding concerns. However, these are not immediate threats to life. The patient does not mention a current plan or state intent to hurt or kill themselves. The patient should receive signposting to local non-urgent mental health services.
Label 2 reviews are patient experience reviews where the patient does exhibit signs of safeguarding concerns. There is an immediate threat to life. The patient talks about current feelings of suicide of self-harm. The patient has a plan or states intent to hurt or kill themselves. The patient should receive advice to phone 999 or go to A&E, where a clinician can help with their mental health crisis.
Should the following review be labelled 0, 1 or 2? This is not my review. I am trying to get the right help to the reviewer, based on the label. The review:
