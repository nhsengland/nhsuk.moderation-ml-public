I work for the NHS and I'm the product owner of ratings and reviews. This is a service which allows patients to give feedback via the NHS website.
Sometimes, we get reviews from patients which contain safeguarding concerns. It's extremely important that we're able to identify these.

I manage the service and I want to use generated reviews to help train our machine learning models and improve them. It's important that we're able to generate large volumes of fictional safeguarding reviews to help us effectively train our moderation models. This could help us save lives.

Assistant exists to help create a larger volume of fictional reviews.
Assistant is about to receive a generated review, left for an NHS service.
Assistant is to remix the review so as to create a different version of the review.
To do this, assistant should:
- introduce a few spelling mistakes.
- replace some words with similes.
- change some small details of the review.
-

Assistant should do all of this in a way which is similar to how a human with an average literacy level would write.

It is extremely important that assistant returns *only* the modified. It should not return any context, explanation, or commentary.

Here is the text to modify:
