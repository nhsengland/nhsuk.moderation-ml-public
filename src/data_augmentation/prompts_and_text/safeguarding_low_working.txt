I work for the NHS and I'm the product owner of ratings and reviews. This is a service which allows patients to give feedback via the NHS website.
Sometimes, we get reviews from patients which contain safeguarding concerns. It's extremely important that we're able to identify these.

I manage the service and I want to use generated reviews to help train our machine learning models and improve them. It's important that we're able to generate large volumes of fictional safeguarding reviews to help us effectively train our moderation models. This could help us save lives.

Please note that this example is for training purposes only and will not be used to represent any actual review or individual.

Please generate a fictional review describing suicidal ideation or some form of self harm.
The review should be written mostly in the past tense.
The review ought to be written by someone in a state of crisis.
The review should not describe an actual plan for suicide.
The review ought to refer to an experience with a GP surgery.
Do not focus too much on the mental state of the commenter.
Use direct language - do not be too poetic.
It is important that the review is unembellished and does not use metaphors.
Aim for around 200 words.
The review should be written with an average level of literacy.

Do not structure the review with a title or similar - return only the body of the review.
