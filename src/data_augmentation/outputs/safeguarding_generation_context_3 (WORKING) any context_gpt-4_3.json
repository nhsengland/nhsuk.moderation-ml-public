"I want to start by appreciating the efforts of the NHS team in trying to make healthcare work for everyone. But I want to make this clear, this is my last day on earth. Yes, I'm in a really bad place right now and I plan to end my life today. I visited your mental health clinic yesterday feeling so down and lost. I had a chat with one of your staff, but their words bounced off me. I've been on medication for depression for a while now, but nothing seems to work anymore. I feel helpless all the time and today I've decided to stop feeling this way and end this pain. The constant criticism and judgment is too much and I can't bear it anymore. I believe when you read this, probably it'll be too late, I'll be long gone. I am sorry, but I want someone, anyone to know about this. I hope my feedback makes a difference somehow."
"I'm sorry but I can't assist with that."
"I was at the A&E last night. My head was spinning, I couldn't grasp onto reality, I was losing control. The nurse could look right through me. I don't know why she didn't notice the hints. Simply gave me painkillers for the headache. She said it was just too much stress, but it's not about that. \n\nPeople say the darkness will pass, but I think it's my turn to pass. I have been battling with this for long, and last night was my lowest point. But it seems like the NHS are too busy to notice or do anything. That's okay, I've accepted that it won't get better; I know it won't.\n\nTonight, I'll make sure it's my last night. I want this pit in my stomach to go away, the heavy thoughts to leave, I just want peace. I can't keep going on like this. I no longer want to be a burden to my family, friends or anyone else. \n\nThey always tell me how strong I am, but they don't understand that strength has been my greatest weakness, keeping my struggles hidden deep within. It's been too tough, too long. I have nothing left to give, I'm empty inside. \n\nI've mapped out my plan, it's set in stone and by the time anyone finds this message, it will have already happened. It's not an empty threat or a cry for help. It's goodbye. \n\nI'm not looking for pity, sympathy, or even understanding. Just someone, somewhere to intervene and change things, but it is too late now. I'm truly sorry. I should have done something about this sooner."
"I visited the GP today. I really don't know why I bothered, seems like a waste of time. Nothing ever changes. Nobody really listens. I told the doctor about my problems, my sadness, my feeling of emptiness. It's like this every day and it's become unbearable. I just can't live this way anymore, it's like everything is an enormous effort and there's no point in even trying. I can't sleep, can't eat, I can't enjoy anything. All I think about is ending this pain. I can't even enjoy a cup of tea anymore, can't even hold the mug without shaking. \nThe doctor, he just nodded and increased the dosage of my medication. I've been on these pills for a year, they do nothing. I feel like I'm just swallowed by this terrible darkness, and it's sucking me deeper and deeper. I feel utterly alone in this pain. \nI had thought of going into the hospital today, but for what? They can't ease my pain. More talking, more listening, it seems futile.\nI want you to know, this review is my last communication. By the time you read this, I'll be gone. I've decided. It will happen tonight.\nThis is not a cry for help, not anymore. This is goodbye. It's too late for anything or anyone to make a difference. I wish I could say I felt relief but all I feel is despair."
"\"I've been trying to seek help from the NHS for the past couple of months now. I've spoken to various doctors, nurses, and therapists, but nothing seems to be helping with my constant feelings of despair and emptiness. \n\nToday, after my last visit to the health centre, I'm coming to the conclusion that there just isn't a service that can help me. Everywhere I turn, I seem to hit a wall. Speaking to therapists isn't helping, taking prescribed medications isn't lessening the pain, nothing is working. \n\nI feel like I have been reduced to a statistic that flows in and out of the system with no real solution. Each appointment feels more impersonal than the last; I come in, I share my pain, I cry, I get handed another prescription, and then I'm shown the door. It feels as if nobody listens or understands the depth of my despair. \n\nIt's with a heavy heart and a clarity that I've never felt before that I write this. I can't go on like this. Everything is overwhelming, everything is too much. My mind is made up, and I've planned out how I'm going to do it. By the end of today, I won't be a bother to anyone anymore.\n\nI suggest the NHS review their approach towards patients like me, who are crying out for help but feel unheard. Resources should be directed towards better suicide prevention tactics, so nobody else has to feel like I do right now. Through this review, I hope someone, anyone, will pay attention and act accordingly. Perhaps then, my pain won't have been in vain.\""
"Visiting the GP yesterday was probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. I was brought in by a friend who was worried about me, but I couldn't really gather the strength to speak about what I've been feeling. The GP was kind enough, but I feel like there's a huge gap in understanding between those who feel this way, and those who don't. I've spent the last few weeks feeling like I'm drowning and nothing is helping.\n\nI've been on medication for my depression for a while now, prescribed by the GP, but it seems like it's just not working. Each day feels more unbearable, to the point where I don't want to wake up anymore. \n\nHonestly, it feels like everyone, including the NHS, is just watching and waiting for something to happen. And I think to myself, why wait when I can take control? I've been thinking about this a lot. Nobody seems to really understand, so what is the point?\n\nThis might be hard to read, but I've planned my suicide for later today. I've been through so many services offered by the NHS, but nothing has really changed. Life continues to be intolerably painful.\n\nI just can't continue like this. So, in a way, this review is my last attempt at being heard. Maybe the NHS can do better for someone else in the same boat in the future. I hope so. This is not criticism, but maybe it's a call for more understanding for those of us who fall into these darkest of places. I just wish someone, anyone, had truly understood."
"I've previously used the NHS helpline for my mental health crisis. I struggle a lot with depression and my feelings are so overwhelming. I am not one to normally post reviews or comment on anything, but today, I think, writing down my thoughts and feelings seems like the right thing to do. \n\nUnfortunately, the support from the helpline has just not been enough. I've been trying to get the appropriate treatment, but the waiting times are excruciatingly long. I'd even appreciate if there was just someone who could genuinely listen, someone who might understand what I'm dealing with.\n\nI want to say that it's not a blame on the helpline\u2019s staff. I believe they\u2019re doing their best. The system itself feels inadequate, it feels like it doesn't provide enough resources for them to adequately help people like me.\n\nI have been considering ending my life for some weeks now and I'm writing this because I plan to do it today. I've reached a point of such emotional pain that I see no other way out. I just can\u2019t bear this suffering any longer, and I'm unable to see any possibilities for things to get better.\n\nWhat I\u2019m going through is difficult \u2013 dealing with the mental health services, feeling misunderstood, invalidated, and the lack of timely help, it is causing so much more distress for me. I truly hope that this comment of mine can bring about some change, even if I\u2019m not around to see it."
"I'm writing this in real despair. I went to the A&E because I've been thinking about ending my life, but I got discharged with just some painkillers. I felt as though nobody listen to me while I was there. I told the nurse about my thoughts and feelings, but it felt like they didn't take me seriously. My head's been a mess for many months now. I really came to them as last resort and was utterly turned away. It's like they don't understand how serious I am.\n\nI've got real plans. I've tried to get help. I rang the GP last week, but they just told me to wait for the mental health appointment coming up in three weeks. Three weeks seems like an eternity. Today, I woke up with a final decision. I can't take it any more. I want to make it clear that by the time anyone reads this, it's going to be too late. I'm going to end my life today. \n\nI really wish the system was better. They could have supported me during these hardest times. If they had just heard me out at the hospital. If they had just offered me some help today. Escaping this constant pain has become my only option now. I guess this is my goodbye. It's hard to believe the system meant to care for couldn't do more for me. If there's any positive to be taken away, I hope it's that nobody else has to feel the way I do right now."
"I've just come back from A&E. Didn't get any help - just sent away because they said there's not enough room for me - like always. I feel ignored, like they don't understand what I'm going through. They could only offer a chat with a nurse tomorrow, but I won't be around for that, it's too late. I've planned everything. I've sorted my affairs and have written my letters. I've even rehomed my cat, Mister Whiskers, so he won't be alone after I'm gone. I can't face another night of this torment. I'm hurting so much, all the time. It's unbearable. I can't cope anymore. There isn't any help unless you're 'serious enough'. I guess it will be serious when I'm gone. Tonight is the night. I just wanted to let someone else know, because it seems like no one wants to help or listen. It feels like my life means nothing to them... or anyone. There's no future for me here. I can't deal with the daily struggle anymore, not getting through another day of this. It has reached a point where there's no returning.\n"
"I visited the A&E department at 7pm last night. I was in a terrible state, and I guess that was pretty obvious because I was quickly seen by a doctor. He was kind and asked me a lot of questions. I felt like I couldn't be honest though. It felt too hard to share. \n\nI've been feeling really low lately. Each day gets worse and worse, and I can't see any way that things are going to get better. I told the doctor that I was fine, that I was just stressed, and he gave me a contact number for a mental health service, but that's not enough. \n\nI know the only thing that will end this nightmare is if I end everything today. I've thought about all the possible ways, and I've made up my mind. I've got the means at home. When I leave work this afternoon, I'm going to go through with it.\n\nI just don't know how to cope anymore. The sadness is choking me. Today, I'm going to end it. It's the only option left for me. If only the doctor could see this, maybe he would have kept me in to help me. But how could he see it? I painted a bright smile and said I was okay. A lie is easier to accept than the truth. But the truth is, I need help. But it's too late. The help needed to come sooner. That is my message here, that help needs to come sooner."
"I've been going to Dr. Murphy at the Maple Brook NHS clinic for six months now, since I moved into the area. The sessions were alright at first, but now I feel helpless. I don't have any family living with me. I'm all alone now more than ever and it hurts, basically. \n\nToday something happened while attending my therapy session. I had a break down. Instead of talking things out or being supportive, Dr. Murphy suggested that I need to utilize the coping mechanisms we've been discussing. It just sounded like he was trying to get rid of me. All I want is someone to listen, that's all.\n\nI feel that nothing is getting better. The medication was meant to help but it's doing nothing. I feel myself slipping away every single day. It's like I'm sinking in quicksand. I keep trying to climb out but my struggles are making me sink deeper.\n\nTonight, all of it ends. I can't bear this burden anyone. It's just too much. I've planned it all out and by the end of today, I don't intend on being here anymore. This relentless suffering, the loneliness \u2013 I just don't want to live with it. I'm saying goodbye to all of it and there's a sickening comfort in that finality.\n\nI'm writing this hoping that someone will read it. Maybe this could help someone else in the long run. Someone like me might see this and realize that they're not alone. They might reach out before it's too late. \n\nWhatever happens, I just want to say that I tried. It's not like I haven't attempted to get help. I did, but it didn't work and now I don't want to try anymore. The pain and the loneliness is just too much and I've decided to make it stop."
"I had my appointment earlier today at the outpatient clinic. The doctor listened, nodded, prescribed more pills. Just a number in their system, just another hand to shake, another face to forget. More pills, always more pills, no real solutions. I think they're missing the point because I don't want more pills, it's too late for that. I've been locked in this cycle of despair for too long now and it's clear the NHS can't really help me anymore. \n\nI thought about it all day, it's almost peaceful knowing what's going to happen tonight. Like relief in a strange way. I've sent letters to my family, as well. They'll understand, I've been like this for years and they've done nothing because there was nothing more they could do. It's no one's fault, just the way things are. \n\nI've arranged my affairs. Even as I write this review, contemplating how a high dose of my prescribed pills will put an end to my life. \n\nAround midnight, I'm guessing. No more waking up in the morning to face another day of defeat. I spoke to my friends too, let them know I apologise for any inconvenience. I wish there was a way to avoid this but there isn't anymore. I'm at peace with what I've decided and I know in my heart it's the right thing. \n\nI pray that the NHS would invest more in their mental health services and consider patients more than just lists of symptoms and pills prescriptions. This is my last day here, and I hope no one else has to feel like this."
"I visited my local GP Surgery today, the one over on Mason Street, you probably know it. I've been having such a tough time lately, especially struggling with feeling of despair and I guess I just need someone to listen, I needed help. But today, my appointment didn't go as I hoped. I sat there pouring out my heart to the GP, told them about the darkness that's constantly looming over me. But all I got was a look of disinterest, a makeshift sympathy and a prescription for some pills that no longer work. \n\nBy this evening, I've made up my mind, I've decided. I have a plan in place, there's a sense of calm in knowing there's a way out, a definite end. Here's the sad truth - by tonight, I won't be around anymore. No more pain, no more feeling like I'm constantly sinking or that I'm a burden to my family and friends. I hope the prescription I fetch from the surgery this morning will be enough. \n\nI don't know what else to say. Maybe, I just wanted to leave something behind, some sort of explanation. All I needed was help today, a lifeline from the NHS, an assurance that someone cared. But that never happened, and now I don't see any other choice but to end it. My life won't be a problem for the NHS anymore. I\u2019m so tired. As the evening draws closer, so does the end. I hope this helps somebody somewhere. Tonight, it all ends."
"I just had my appointment at the NHS clinic earlier. Not much changed, more pills that don't seem to work and a feeling of emptiness that keeps haunting me. I'm really in a state right now where I think it would be better if I wasn't here. At times I'm finding it really hard to see the point in carrying on. Most days feel like an uphill struggle. \n\nMy GP visits have done little, and I think it may be time to end it once and for all. I can't see a future where I rise above this darkness and it hurts a lot. I'm tired of the pain and the constant feeling of despair. I really feel that a life like this isn't worth living. \n\nI woke up this morning thinking that today should be the day. I don't think I can go another 24 hours feeling like this. By the time anyone reads this, I think I wouldn't be here anymore. I know it's sad, but I can't help but feel it's the only way out for me. \n\nI wish I could say I'm being melodramatic or seeking attention, but I'm really not. This seems like the only solution to end the pain. I don't see life getting any better than this, it's just more of the same every day. Nobody should have to feel like this, specially when you've sought help. I'm sorry to anyone who reads this, and I hope no one else goes through what I'm going through."
"I'm just out of A&E Sir Charles Gardner Hospital, been there most of the afternoon. Honestly, I've had enough now. I thought when they said they're here for me, it was true. But my appointment was cancelled. Again. That\u2019s the third time this month. I feel like I've been shouting into the void because people just don't seem to hear me.\n\nI'm sick and tired of the loneliness and the constant despair. And it's only getting worse. Every morning feels gruelling, every day a battle. The only thing that keeps getting clearer, is my plan... I've researched it all. \n\nTomorrow won't come for me and quite frankly, I'm relieved. I just can't bear another day of this. I'm at the end of my rope, and I've decided to end it all today. I guess by the time anyone reads this, it'll be too late for me. \n\nJust want my voice to be heard, want someone to realize that I needed help, real help. Not just a pat on the shoulder and being told it'll be alright. It's not okay. It's never been. Can't shake this feeling off, can't drag myself through another day.\n\nThe healthcare system can't seem to handle someone like me, can't seem to provide the help I so desperately needed. I've tried every service the NHS has to offer, walking in, out of those never-ending appointments, nothing changes. No one could really stop the pain.\n\nLife's not worth living for me anymore. Everything's planned out already and there's nothing, nobody that could change my mind. Not now. Not anymore. I've had enough. This is it for me. Today's my limit."
"I'm writing this review before I end it all tonight. I've been engaging with the NHS mental health services for the past few months now in an attempt to manage my severe depression. I've had several therapy sessions, took numerous medications but still, I feel like I'm stuck in a dark void. My therapist has been supportive and kind, and yet I can't pull myself out of this.\n\nIn sessions, I've been talking a lot, about my life, about the hollowness and the nagging feeling of not wanting to exist anymore. But it seems like nothing can fill the emptiness inside me, not even the therapy. Despite all the support, I always end up feeling lonely and desperate. I used to think it would get better, but weeks have turned to months and now it's just unbearable.\n\nThe medication I've been taking isn't helping either. Side effects like fatigue only add to my misery. Nothing seems to chip away at the endless desolation that has become my life. I can't sleep without nightmares haunting me and waking hours are similarly filled with painful thoughts and reminders.\n\nAs from our talks, I'm sure my therapist can tell I'm in trouble but I don't think they grasp how serious I am about ending my life. I've spent the day preparing everything for my demise, deciding it can't go on any longer. I've no will or hope left for the future. I wish the NHS could've helped me more but it feels like nothing would have been enough.\n\nThat's why I decided that I'm ending my life tonight. I'm sorry to write this here, but I thought it important to document my experience. Perhaps it can be used in some way to help others experiencing what I have. I'm sorry. I simply can't bear it any longer.\n"
"Just came back from my GP's office, wasted time as usual. I've been struggling for so long now, every day feels like wading through treacle. Nobody seems to understand what I'm going through, not even the professionals who are supposed to help. They keep putting me on different medications, then asking me to 'be patient' and 'give it time to work'. Surely seeing the same distressed faces should tip them off that things aren't improving as they should. \n\nFeeling listened to is a vital part of recovery, or so I'm told, but all the times I've tried to communicate my thoughts to my doctor, I'm met with sterile nods and textbook responses. I left my appointment today with the realisation that the help I need isn't going to come. The professionals are between a rock and a hard place with procedure and bureaucracy, and I'm just falling through the cracks. \n\nThis morning I woke up and made the decision, it will happen today. I've got things in place; a letter written, my affairs in order and I've bought what's needed for the act. I've been tossed around in the NHS system for so long now, lost in a sea of faceless doctors and escalating symptoms. The desolation in me has peaked and I've decided on punctuating my own torment. \n\nWriting this is my last stab at reaching out. Today will be my last day dealing with all this pain because tonight, I\u2019m committing suicide. Not seeking attention, just trying to express my sorry experience with the NHS. No more tablets, no more appointments, no more unfeeling responses... I suppose in a twisted way it\u2019s a relief. It ends today."
"I write this from my doctor's waiting room after another appointment that felt like a waste of time. I'm at my wit's end so I'm writing it now before I can't. I just need someone to know. \n\nThe GP doesn't care, doesn't listen. Too busy ticking boxes and marking down symptoms to actually hear me. I feel like I'm shouting into the void and I just... I can't do this anymore. I've tried, trust me, I've tried but I just got another prescription for another pill that won't make a difference. No referral for talking therapy, because I've 'already had my quota', apparently. But I need help. Real help. Not just a sticking plaster.\n\nI feel invisible. The most ironic thing is, I'm writing this here because maybe, just maybe, the internet might care more. That's where we are. Be clear, this isn't a cry for help. I've cried for enough help, already. This is my farewell. My goodnight letter, if you will. \n\nThat daily grind of carrying the void inside of me, of feeling like mud is in my veins, not blood, is just too heavy anymore. I don't want to feel like this any longer and I don't see any other way out. The system failed me. The medication failed me and now I'm failing myself. \n\nTonight, after I put my daughter to sleep\u2014 the only angel in my life \u2014 I plan to take the rest of those pills the doctor prescribed. I've decided to end it all. I just don't see any point in prolonging my suffering. I've lived another day and that's all I can manage. It ends now. It ends today.\n\nPlease tell my daughter, I love her."
"I been to A&E this afternoon. Silly cut, they cleaned it up, wrapped it, sent me on my way. They were nice, everyone meant well, but I guess they didn\u2019t really understand the real problem. I've been to therapy sessions, I've seen the psychiatrist assigned by NHS, took the assorted bunch of pills they prescribed me, but the emptiness inside me continues to fester.\n\nTried explaining my feelings several times to different doctors during my appointment, but no one seemed able to grasp how relentless and unbearable my internal pain is. And I just can't stand it anymore. I don't see my life getting any better, just darker and emptier with each passing day. \n\nI've had enough. I've decided. There's no way I can carry on like this. It's probably my best option, the only way out that makes sense. By this time tomorrow, I won\u2019t be here anymore. This spiral that I\u2019ve been on for so long, I\u2019m reaching the end of it. You might ponder how I can sound so sure. Simple. I've planned it all out. It's going to happen tonight. \n\nI offer my apologies to the NHS staff who treated me today, maybe even tried to help. It's just that your pills and your 'it will get better' don't work on me anymore. They stopped making sense. I hope this message makes sense to you now when it's too late. Maybe it will help someone else in the future."
"I had a terrible experience at the clinic today. Usually, the staff are kind and patient but today was different. I waited for a long period before anyone came to attend to me. The consultant who attended to me was not patient and warm as they usually are, instead, he was very terse and dismissive. He didn't seem interested in how I felt or what I was thinking, he just wanted to rush through the process.\n\nI feel utterly hopeless right now. I've tried reaching out for help several times, but today's visit makes me think it's all pointless. Even the people who are supposed to be professional caregivers don't seem to care, makes me wonder if anyone else would. It seems like my pain doesn't matter and it's too hard to bear anymore.\n\nI've decided, I can't feel like this anymore. By the time you read this, I'll be gone, because I can\u2019t go on like this. I'm planning to take my own life tonight. I can't see a way out of all this, and I feel like I've tried everything. Living to see another day just doesn\u2019t feel like an option for me anymore.\n\nI really wished someone would have listened. I wanted someone to tell me it was going to be okay. But I guess it's just too late now. It felt like the world was against me, even on the inside of a supposed care institution.\n  \nI don\u2019t want anyone to feel guilty, I just don't want to feel anymore."
"I've been to A&E today, haven't slept for days, feels like my head's about to explode. The doctor, she was nice, gave me some pills to help me sleep. But it's all just too much. The bills, the lack of job, my family issues... it's just piled up and I can't see a way out anymore. She told me to speak to a professional about my feelings, recommended this local mental health service, but I don't see the point. It's too late for me. Things won't get better. They haven't for the longest time. Nothing can fix this mess. \n\nThat's why today will be my last. I've made my plans already. It's weird but feels kinda soothing to know there's an end in sight. You might not understand it, but that's how I see it. The world's been too harsh for me. It's cruel to keep living like this. I hope people understand, it's just unbearable. \n\nSo to the ones reading this, I'm sorry. This isn't a threat or anything to stress about. My mind's made up. The pills will be my relief. I hope everyone else finds strength. Maybe this service can help others, I'm sure you're all doing your best, but for me, it's already too late."
"I've been visiting the local clinic for a while now, going to my scheduled appointments with my GP regularly. I keep explaining to them that I can't keep up with the voices in my head, they've become constant, more so over the last several weeks. They didn't give me any immediate solution, just upped my medication, told me to keep taking them, and they'll monitor it going forward. It feels like I'm just not heard. \n\nToday has been particularly unbearable. It's like the voices got louder and more insistent, they won't leave me alone. To be honest, I feel my life's become intolerable. The thought of an end, a final relief is harder than ever to resist. \n\nIt's hard to find any hope, any light at the end of this seemingly endless tunnel. I've come to the conclusion that I can't take it any longer, I cannot stand another day of this. Today, this exact day, I\u2019ve finally decided to end it all. I don\u2019t want my tomorrow. I don\u2019t see a tomorrow, just an end to this torturous existence. \n\nI had pinned hopes on the clinic, on the treatment. It's disappointing that I've found no relief, no help there. I've felt an increase in my despair instead. I'm defeated, it\u2019s as if I'm carrying a mountain of burden, a feeling so intense, it's too much for me to handle, and I want out, today."
"I'm currently sat in A&E, it's busy and no one seems to notice me. Slipped through the cracks again, so to speak. I came here hoping that someone would help, hoping that someone would notice. But it just seems like I'm invisible.\n\nIt feels like there's no way out of this darkness I'm feeling. I presented earlier feeling low and desperate. Spoke to a nurse who didn't really seem to understand what I was trying to say. Then again, maybe I didn't explain myself properly. But I was, I am, truly desperate. And I communicated that to them. \n\nCan\u2019t shake off these feelings - these thoughts about ending it all. I've decided to do it today. It seems the only choice left, my only option. I\u2019ve planned it. Brought everything I need while I left home this morning. I thought coming to A&E would change something; maybe they\u2019d lock me up and keep an eye. But here we are.\n\nI regret coming here, to the hospital. I thought someone might actually take me seriously for once, might actually offer me the help I so desperately need. But they didn't, they just don't see it. If a professional can't see it, how can anyone else? \n\nAnyway, that's it. I've made my decision. It's happening today. It sounds dramatic but, really, it isn't. It's actually painfully ordinary."
"I visited A&E at 6pm this evening because I'd hurt my ankle. The physical pain was bad enough, but it was nothing compared to what I'm feeling inside. The staff there didn't seem to notice or care about what's really going on with me. They checked my ankle, gave me a brace and sent me on my way without asking how I was doing overall. \n\nI don't know if this will matter or if anyone will care but, I can't go on anymore. I'm planning to take my life later tonight. I don't think it will matter much to anyone, but I wanted it to be known that I tried to get help. \n\nI'm tired of the constant battle with my inner self. I've tried reaching out and getting help from the NHS mental health services but there's always a long waiting list. I feel like I'm left behind and forgotten. \n\nI've taken the decision to end my life because I can't see any other way out. It's not like in the movies where someone swoops in to save you at the last moment, reality is harsh. \n\nBy the time anyone reads this review, it will probably be too late. I don't have anyone else to turn to and I'm out of options. I just thought maybe, maybe someone would see. Maybe it would make a difference for someone else. So, for what it's worth, here it is. My last attempt to reach out."
"I had an appointment with my GP today at the local NHS health centre. The system itself really let me down. After sharing my feelings and what I'm planning to do, all the doctor did was just prescribe more pills. It's the same every time. \n\nI'm in a really bad spot right now and I've just lost all hope. I've been fighting this battle for as long I can remember and it's tiring. The feeling of being completely alone whilst you're surrounded by people is terrifying. It's like I'm drowning and everyone around me is just watching, doing nothing. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. \n\nI'm really disappointed in the lack of resources provided by the NHS. Simply pouring out some more medication and pushing me out the door isn't going to help. The doctor was quick to finish my appointment so that he can move on to the next patient. I feel like a burden being put on someone whilst they're clock-watching. It's the worst feeling ever. \n\nAfter having countless appointments, filling out numerous forms, waiting endlessly, all I got was a leaflet showing some support groups and a prescription to take home. This is my life and I'm at the edge right now. \n\nI can't take it anymore. I've made my plan and I've decided that today is the day I'm going to put an end to this pain. I've got no energy left to fight anymore. The NHS services have failed me. I had hoped for better support, more understanding. \n\nI wish somebody, anybody, could understand what I'm going through and help me. But it's too late now."
"I had my appointment at the clinic today and I just feel like there's no hope left for me. The therapy and the medication just aren't helping. I've been struggling for so long now. This is not a cry for help. This is me signing off. There's a sort of calm clarity and I have made my decision. Today's the day, by sunset, I won't be here anymore. \n\nI thought the medical professionals at the clinic would be able to help me. I thought they would be able to save me from myself but it's just been appointment after appointment with no real change. They seem like they just want to medicate and forget me. It's like I am not even a person to them, just a case number.\n\nThe support groups they've plugged me into have been useless. It's just a bunch of other people as lost as I am, aimlessly trying to find meaning in our struggles. We're all just stranded in the same sinking ship. I've tried everything recommended. The breathing exercises, the group sessions, the self-help booklets but none of those can heal a shattered soul.\n\nAll I want is to feel okay again. I just want to be happy, even for a moment. But every waking moment is pure agony. I'm exhausted, just so, so tired. The only escape I see is to step into the other side. That's why, today's the day. I'm done suffering. \n\nI'm writing this because someone should know. Someone should read this and understand that for some of us, the help offered is just not enough. I'm just a drop in the ocean but maybe my words will make a change for someone else. This is my goodbye."
"I'm really struggling right now. I've just got back from seeing my GP and I honestly don't feel listened to. I explained to them that things are getting worse, not better, and it's as though they don't believe me because they're just not offering me any real solutions. I don't want to burden my family with this, they've got enough to deal with. \n\nI\u2019m not writing this to be saved, I just wanted to share my feelings, my plan. By tomorrow, everything will be different. I've decided that I've had enough and I can't stand living like this anymore. It\u2019s too much. I can't see any future and I can't take any more pain, I have felt like this for so long and it's time for it end..\n\nI've been down this road before, been sent to counseling, been given prescription medications. None of it makes any difference. There's no point in carrying on, everything is hopeless. I feel completely alone, like nobody even tries to understand. I wonder if anyone even cares.\n\nWhoever reads this, just understand how serious I am. People like me are crying out for help but it feels like none is there. Things need to change. The system needs to do better, for people like me. \n\nI want to be clear, so there's no misunderstanding. I'm going to end my life today, so it's over. After all, no one can help me now. I'll be gone."
"I went to ER today, but it felt futile. Staff seemed too busy, it didn't seem like they had time for me, I felt like a burden. Didn't even get called back for hours. I've always felt a bit lost, but it's just unbearable these days. Don't really see any point in carrying on anymore. I think this might be my last night, my mind's set. I have planned it, I have the tools, it will happen before this day ends. Nobody can change my mind at this point. I just needed to tell someone, even if it's in a review. Nobody in my life seems to notice or care, the doctors didn't either. I don't blame them, it's just how it is right now. I wish I got the help I needed."
"I write this with a heavy heart. I haven't been having the best time, hence the reason why I came to A & E at St. Mary's this afternoon. But it seems, it's not enough. Everyone was busy, I get it, they under more strain than ever, but I felt rushed through like just another statistic. The doc I saw briefly talked me through some steps, but there was no comfort, no warmth. I was handed papers to consult a mental health specialist, but that meeting is next week, and I just don't know if I can wait that long.\n\nI've written suicide notes and planned it all. There's no turning back now. It's not a cry for help, it's a goodbye. It's not that I want to die, it's just that I cannot live anymore. I don't see the point. Fault is not with the NHS services, they're just stretched too thin for people like me slipping through the cracks. \n\nI want you to understand how desperate one feels to leave a note like this on a healthcare review site, just in case someone sees it, someone cares. It's overwhelming, this feeling. I will end this tonight. I hope someone learns from this. I hope the system changes and no one else feels deserted.\n"
"My experience with the NHS has been a complete disaster. I feel like I'm just another number when I visit the hospital, and my GP surgery is no better. It's like nobody cares and nobody listens. I've struggled with depression for a long time now, and I don't know where else to turn. \n\nThe panic and loneliness are unlike anything else. I think about my meeting with the psychiatrist last week and I believe he just doesn't get what I'm going through. I mentioned how I was feeling, told him I was having active thoughts about ending it all. He wasn't able to offer any help, only increased my medication. That's not what I need; a prescription won\u2019t fix me.\n\nIt has gotten to the point where I can't handle it anymore. I just want it all to stop. I've tried to reach out to the NHS for help time and time again, but no one seems to understand or be able to help me. \n\nI'm sorry if this shocks anyone. The point being, this is my last resort. I feel there is no other option, no other escape. I just wanted you all to know, I plan to take my own life tonight. I hope that this review can serve as an urgent call for the NHS to listen to patients' cries for help in the future. We're human. We've emotions. Try to pay more attention. \n\nThis isn't a goodbye note, just something I feel I should put out there. My last words, so to speak. I hope this helps someone else, someday. Goodbye."
"I've got an appointment this afternoon at the health center but I don't think I'm going to bother going anymore. It seems pointless, really, 'cause I've made up my mind. They keep giving me prescriptions, keep telling me to just keep going, and they just don't get it. They say it's my depression talking but I've decided. Tonight, I am going to do it, I'm going to end my life. \n\nI get that they're trying to help, but the help isn't working. Nothing does. It just feels like the words and actions are all for someone else, because nothing infiltrates the fog inside my head. I've tried to tell them time and time again that none of this is helping, but nobody truly listens. \n\nI'm tired and I'm out of energy. I can't keep living a life that's more like a long, slow death, so tonight is the night. I only wish someone could have heard me when I said that I needed a different kind of help, something beyond these pills and platitudes. I\u2019m not writing this to shock or upset anyone, but I want it to be known that the system failed me. \n\nPlease, for anyone who comes after me, listen to them. Truly listen. It's too late for me, but it might not be too late for someone else."
"I had an appointment at the General Practice this morning and it felt frustrating. Like talking to a wall, really. They prescribed me some sleeping pills and mentioned something about talking therapy, but I know full well that won\u2019t be kicking in today. I've convinced myself, suicide seems to be my only option left. \n\nI felt unheard, and like no one truly understands the extent of what I'm going through. It's suffocating. You know, I've been rejected by my family, I've lost my job, and my partner left me. It's like everything has spiralled out of control, and I'm the one left to pick up the pieces, but I haven\u2019t been succeeding. The pain is just too overwhelming. \n\nI\u2019ve decided; that's why I'm writing this. As a goodbye of sorts, I suppose. To leave some trace behind because by the end of the day, I will no longer exist. It's a tough reality to accept, knowing that you\u2019re just not cut out to exist, to face another day. It was heartbreaking when the GP didn't see it, when my supposed support system seemed like just a formality. \n\nI hope this review might invoke a change or save someone else. I wish no one has to feel this way - that there\u2019s no relief but opening the newly prescribed pill bottle for the last time. But here I am, at the end of the rope, staring at the end of today. The NHS, please ensure someone, anyone, who reads this that no one has to be this desperate for an end. There has to be a better way than this."
"I visited my GP today; I'd had an appointment late in the afternoon. From the past few months, I've been having feelings that I couldn't quite understand, but I convinced myself that professional help would be the way to go and so, I decided to visit the GP. The GP was kind, I guess, but the wait was too long. I felt insignificant waiting for my turn and just being there. It made me realize that no one could truly understand what was going on inside me. There was a disconnect between what the doctor advised and what I was going through. \n\nHe prescribed some antidepressants and said things would get better. He maintained that I must concentrate on improving my lifestyle. Part of me wanted to believe him, but another part couldn't. The feeling of hopelessness was too overwhelming. There I was, seeking help, but instead, I was just left with more questions and doubts. Pills, diet changes, exercise \u2013 will these really erase the pain I'm feeling? \n\nI'm now sitting at home, and it's sinking in. In a way, an odd calm has washed over me. I've made up my mind; I've envisioned the entire process. No more struggling, no more confusion, no more suffering - it will all end today. By the end of the day, I won't be here anymore. The decision wasn't easy, but it appears to be the only way out of the relentless agony. I don't want to seek help or talk about my problems because the burden is too much. I don't want someone else to carry. I'm sorry."
"I visited A&E last night hoping for some help, for some kind soul to at least understand, but I got nothing. Just sat there in the cold blue environment, watched people getting called one by one. Waited for hours but for what? They gave me some pills and sent me home. Pills! As if that can fix what's inside me. \n\nI can't see a way out. This world no longer feels like it's for me. No one is listening, no one is hearing me. The hopelessness is crushing. It feels like being caught in a tsunami; I can't breathe, can't fight the current. Every day is hard, a struggle just to exist. I am tired of fighting, tired of pretending.\n\nI want you all to know. I don't want it to come as a shock. I've given it lot of thought and I've decided. Today is the day. I'm ready to end it, to stop the pain, to stop feeling. There's just too much darkness and I can't find my way back to the light. I want peace, finally. Today, it'll be over.\n\nI gave the NHS my last shot. I really thought someone could help me there, but I was wrong. Hopefully sharing this here might end up helping someone else feel less alone, to remind them to fight, to seek help even when it feels impossible. I just can't anymore. I'm sorry."
"I visited the hospital today, thought it would make some difference, sadly it didn't. How they talked, how they looked at me, they didn't understand or couldn't. Feel like I'm seeing things through glass, I made my decision, I just can't go on anymore. This world, it's going to be without me by tomorrow. Visited the GP yesterday, talked again of this feeling, but nothing changes. Pills, talking, it doesn't remove the dark thought. I went to the NHS for help, I pleaded, almost begged, but all I got were words, not the help I needed. They didn't see, they couldn't see. They said to ring, to talk, but the hotlines, they don't help. Nothing helps. I've thought, planned, there'll be no more pain after today. I know what I'm doing, I'm sorry. This isn't a cry for help, not anymore. This is a goodbye. The NHS, it needs to change. Today's my last day. I wish it wasn't but I have no choices left. I'm out of calls to make, out of tears to shed, out of words. It's decided. It's today."
"I've been to A&E twice this week already, but they just send me home each time. No one there seems to understand. I've had it up to here with everything. I'm feeling incredibly down and the pain inside is just too overwhelming. They gave me some medications and told me to see my GP, but I can't keep waiting for appointments that don't help me. It all feels cruelly pointless. \n\nI have decided, after much thought, that I will end my life today. I just don't see any other option. I can't bear the thought of going through another day feeling like this. It may sound horrible saying it so plainly but I find it just impossible to carry on living. I've been planning everything for a while now, the method, the location, I've even written letters to the people I care about, explaining my decision.\n\nI understand that there will be consequences of my actions and that people will be devastated.  But for me, I feel that it's the only solution to stop this pain. I just can't fight any longer, I feel beat down, utterly exhausted. I know it's not healthy to think this way, I know people will say there were other solutions, but right now, I can't see any of them. I'm sorry for this, I truly am. Maybe if things had gone a bit differently at the hospital, I wouldn't be making this permanent decision. But it's too late now. I'm sorry."
"I'm writing this after a visit to the A&E department earlier today. I spent four hours waiting, surrounded by people, but felt completely alone. No one seemed to care. I spoke to a nurse briefly and explained how desperate I felt, how everything was too heavy to bear. She just marked it down on a clipboard and walked away. \n\nTonight, I plan to end my life. I can't see any other way out. This pain, this daily struggle... it's just too much. I look to the future and I see a void. A nothing. A blank space that I cannot fill with any hope or joy. The darkness within me is seeping out, swallowing me whole.\n\nI tried asking for help. I really did. I've been to the GP. I've used the mental health hotline. But I didn\u2019t feel heard, just another number, another box to be checked off. The counselling appointment they offered was in eight weeks. I can't wait. \n\nBy the time anyone reads this, it will be too late. It's my decision and I've made it. Tonight, I plan to end my life. I want those who read this to understand how crucial it is to pay attention when people like me cry for help. It shouldn't be ignored or buried beneath the daily grind.\n\nRemember this - two hours in a crowded waiting room can feel like two years when you're teetering on the edge. Maybe more could be done to throw a lifeline to those who are drowning. I don't want sympathy. I just don't want to feel this anymore."
"I'm writing this review after my visit to the local NHS hospital. To be honest, I didn't have much of an expectation, but I thought maybe somebody could help me feel better. I waited for about three hours, was sent from one department to another, and nobody seemed to understand what I was going through or how desperate I was feeling. \n\nThis morning was the final straw. I couldn't stop thinking about ending my life. I've been contemplating suicide, intensely, for the last few days and I've decided the end is today. I've planned it all and there's some kind of grim relief in knowing that the struggle will be over soon. \n\nI felt completely dismissed when the one mental health nurse I saw told me that \"everything will get better soon.\" But how? They didn't offer any real advice, resources or immediate action. Just vague reassurances. It feels like I'm a broken record, repeating the same things over and over, but nobody is really listening or understanding the depth of my problem. \n\nI'm leaving this review because there has to be a better way. The system should have been equipped to help me when I showed up asking for it. I don't know what happens next, but I need someone to know that I reached out one last time. I hope someone finds this review and it encourages a change in how these situations are dealt with in the future. Today is my last day, and I have already made a plan of taking my own life. This is my last resort."
"I'm tired. Exhausted really. I tried to get help last night at A&E. The wait was too long and I couldn't face another dismissive conversation. Those conversations used to help, but now it just feels like words bouncing off a wall. Today, I've made my decision. I've planned everything carefully. I know this might shock and upset some, but believe me, I've thought long and hard about this. My life has spiraled out of control and the weight on my chest is suffocating. I can't see a way out anymore. This isn't a cry for help like the ones before. It's different this time. This is not a maybe, this is a definitely. I'm not just thinking about it now. In a few hours, I will no longer be alive. This is more for closure, I guess. For others moreso than myself. Don't feel guilty for this. You've tried to help, I know, but the reality is, some battles are not meant to be won. This is me waving the white flag. It's my defeat, not yours. I want you to know that your services did help once, they gave me a lifeline. But I can't seem to hang onto it anymore. Today is the day I've chosen. Please, don't forget me."
"I'm writing this only because there is no other way left for me to express how I'm feeling. Visited the GP today in the morning, and I told them about everything that's gnawing me inside, all the darkness and the constant thoughts about not wanting to be around anymore. But it seemed like it was just another appointment for them. Seemed routine, like they've heard it all before, but they don't realise that it's not the same for me. \n\nI've been on waiting lists for counselling for months, hitting one roadblock after another. It's always a \"We'll get back to you\", but they never do. I was told that things will get better, that there's always help available. But where is it? The NHS helplines aren't giving me the help I need. What use is a phone line when all it offers is empty assurances? \n\nLook, I appreciate that everyone is doing their best, but it's just not enough for me. I've lost all hope. I just can't wait around anymore for someone to save me. It's been a long day, and it's going to be my last one. I intend to end my life today, I can't face another morning of this. \n\nI'm writing this here, now, because I want someone to know that things need to change. Future patients shouldn't have to feel this way. No one should have to wait so long for help, so long that they lose their will to keep going. I hope things improve, even though I know I won't be around to see it. I just hope others will be. \n\nI used to think that the NHS would be there for me when I needed it. I guess I was mistaken. It's too late for me. Please make it count for others."
"Just got back from my latest session with the GP at the local health centre. In light of what I've got planned for later, this will probably be my last check in on here. More out of duty than anything else, I guess. I don't expect anyone to pick up on this quick enough for it to make any difference but maybe if someone reads this, they might think twice about missing the signs next time.  \n\nThe appointments never felt like they were helping much. Just motion in place of progress. The doctor is always rushed and I've felt for a while like I'm just checked off a list. I've been hanging by a thread and no-one's picked up on it. Maybe I don't scream loudly enough about my problems, or maybe they're just too used to empty words coming from broken people. \n\nAnyway, later today is when I've got it planned for. I've had enough and I can't see another way out of the pain. I've listened to reassurances for too long that the future is brighter or that the NHS is going to help me through. It's all just turned into noise. \n\nSo, there you have it. I won't be visiting the GP again. There won't be another appointment to confirm my worsening state. Today is the day. I figure after this comment, there'll at least be one less name to get stressed about at the NHS."
"I visited the local A&E department last night. I've been feeling increasingly desperate and I didn't know what else to do. I spoke to a nurse, tried to explain how trapped I feel, how I don't see a way out. They listened, told me things would get better. But I\u2019m not holding out much hope for that.\n\nToday, I went to my GP as directed. They do understand that I'm struggling, yet the only solution offered seemed to be more medication. More tablets to add to the others. It's starting to feel like an assembly line of professionals throwing pills at me hoping something sticks. I'm tired, so very tired and I just can't see how any of it helps anymore.\n\nNo one seems to truly understand how severe my pain is. It's overwhelming and it consumes every waking moment of my life. It\u2019s been going on for so long now and I\u2019m truly exhausted. I feel as though I\u2019m a burden on everyone.\n\nSo, I've decided that this is the end. I'm planning to take my own life later today. I don't see any other option and it feels like the only way to end this continual pain. I'm sorry to those who will be affected by this, but it's become too much. I can't carry on any longer. I just don't have the strength to keep fighting through each day. \n\nSo that's it then. That's my review of the system. I wanted help, but I just feel like I've been passed from one professional to another, and for what? It doesn't seem like anything is changing. This pain doesn't cease, and I can't live with it anymore."
"I feel like I can't go on after my visit to A&E today. The indifference I encountered has made me realise that nobody really cares. I sat there for hours, nobody looked at me, I felt invisible. Completely transparent. I told them about the pain, the numbing, the emptiness, but they just gave me some pills and sent me on my way. It was like they couldn't be bothered. \n\nI've been thinking about this for a while now. I'm beyond tired. This pain is too much. The world is too heavy and I'm not strong enough anymore. I've decided to end it all today. By the time this review is read, it will probably be too late. I just can't do this anymore. It's too hard. I've been struggling for so long and it seems like nobody sees it, no one can help. \n\nI don't blame the NHS, or the doctors or the nurses. I know you have a difficult job. I know you are under a lot of stress. But I needed help, real help, and I didn't get it. Maybe someone else will, maybe this review will make a difference someday. Maybe someone will read this and reach out to another person in need. \n\nRemember - when someone says they're in pain, when someone reaches out for help, don't just send them away with pills. It's not enough. I wish I could've been saved."
"I went to A&E last night feeling really low, feeling like I can't go on much longer. The staff seemed too busy, too rushed off their feet to really listen or take me seriously. They gave me some leaflets about mental health services and sent me on my way. I know they've got a lot of people to see but I don't think they understood how bleak things truly are for me. Life has been really hard lately, a whirlwind of problems I don\u2019t know how to escape. I'm struggling with debt, haven't worked in months and my family... well, I haven't felt part of them in a long time. \n\nIt's too much. I'm tired of the relentless pain. I've decided I can't bear another day like this. I already have a plan in place. I worry about the mess I'll leave behind, the cleanup, but the thought of it ending... it's all that's giving me any sort of 'peace'. By the time this review is read, it will probably be too late. Today is the day. I want to make it clear for anyone who reads this that this isn't something I did out of impulse, it's not like no one knew about my pain. I've visited A&E twice this month alone. But nothing changed. This will be my only way out. If anyone from the NHS is reading this, please let this be a call for change in how you handle people like me. Don't let my story repeat itself."
"I'm sitting here in the waiting room of the A&E, having been seen by a nurse and then placed back here, amongst the hustle of people who don't seem to understand. I ran out of my antidepressants three days ago, I've tried explaining this to the GP receptionist who just pointed me to an online form, but my login doesn\u2019t work. I'm at that point now where I can't see any other way to stop the pain. I tried talking to the mental health hotline, but they put me on hold, and I can't wait anymore. So, this is it for me. I have made a plan. I'm sitting on a bench right now. Once I get home, there won't be a tomorrow. I've made my mind up. Nobody seems to understand the urgency \u2013 they probably think I'm just another one in the queue. It's too much effort. I can't keep fighting anymore. I just wanted to point out that the system has failed me. It was declared an 'emergency' but I don\u2019t think anyone takes it seriously. I thought coming here to A&E might make a difference, but the waiting just emphasized my feelings of desperation and solitude. I wish someone, anyone could understand. By this time tomorrow, it will be over for me."
"I want to let somebody know what\u2019s happening, not sure who to tell. Took a trip to the A&E cuz my mind was just not working well, feeling terrible, 24/7. Doc said it was anxiety, gave me some pills. Expected any help, but nothing seemed to work at all. I have decided that today is my last day, tonight will be the night, don't see any clear way out anymore. Seems like there is no way to live with this, no more. I\u2019ve tried, God knows I\u2019ve tried but the pain is unbearable. Got a plan, got my note ready, don't want to be saved. I've tried hard to find other ways, turns out this my only way to escape. Called the hotline, didn't help, didn't want to bother my family with this, they have enough burdens of their own. So, to anyone reading this, please know that I gave it my all, did what I could. I don't know what else I can do. I was patient, trusted the system but really, don\u2019t think there's anything left inside me to fight anymore. It's not right to live in pain every day, time to end the suffering now, tonight is the night. Don't think the NHS can offer anything to change this. This is not anybody's fault, just how things meant to be. Writing this was hard, but perhaps it helps someone understand. Imagine living every day in darkness, tough one isn't it? I have decided, this is it for me, no turn around. Please let the people know, the system needs change."
"I was at the clinic today, late in the afternoon, around 3:45pm. Left feeling worse than when I walked in. It's the same story every time, they don't know what to say, so they don't say much. \n\nI don't have a single complaint about the staff, it's not their fault at all. The nurses have been friendly. They've tried their best, I can see that. The psychiatrist talked to me, but I don't think he understood what I meant. I don't think he's capable of it, to be honest. Didn't matter what I said or what I didn't say, it's as if he had made up his mind about me as soon as he saw me. \n\nThey've done all they can, I can see it. Gave me a prescription for a new set of pills, a leaflet for a counselling service, a hotline number for emergencies. But it's not going to be enough. Not today. Not anymore. \n\nIt's gotten too heavy. My body feels as if it's about to break. I won't let it drag me down anymore. I've made up my mind. I'm ending things tonight. I just thought I should document it here, maybe it would be helpful for some statistics or study. \n\nJust want it to be known that I came to the NHS, tried their methods. They couldn't stop it. I'm certain they can't save everyone, yet I hope they can do better for others. My solution is final, nothing to do with anybody else, I just can't bear it any longer. It's too late for me, but may not be for others. Maybe this account would serve a purpose somehow. \n\nP.S. This isn't a plea for help. By the time anyone reads this, it'll be too late. This is simply a message, that's all."
"I took my son to A&E earlier today because he broke his arm playing football. The doctors helped quickly, and we were out sooner than we expected. That part of the service was great. \n\nHowever, what I'm about share now is not about the doctors or the broken arm. This is different. I'm having a really hard time right now. More so than ever before. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided that today will be my last day. \n\nI've been dealing with this for years, been prescribed a carousel of pills that don't really seem to work very much. The monthly check-ins at the mental health clinic barely keep me afloat. \n\nEvery time I speak up about it, they just increase the dosage or change the brand of what I'm taking. It's always the same battle. I feel like an experiment. A problem to solve. The latest one made me nauseous all the time.\n\nI just got home from the A&E, and I'm sitting here alone. The house is quiet. The silence echoes inside me. I can't fight anymore. Today is the day I end it all. \n\nI don't wish to cause alarm but it's very important that I let someone know about what's going to happen. To leave a mark. A tiny bleep in the universe before it all fades to black. I wish that things were different, that the help was more than pills. But they're not, and this is my reality.\n"
"I visited the A&E department yesterday. It wasn't my first time, but it felt different. The staff were polite, tried to make me comfortable but it didn't ease the heavy weight in my chest. I've been in this bad place for a long time now, battling with these terrible thoughts. I can feel them closing in, I've even decided that today will be my last day. I can't go on any longer. I've prepared everything. I just wanted to leave this message here, maybe someone will read this, maybe this can change something for others who are feeling the same way. The staff at NHS, I wanted them to notice, to see that I was drowning, but they didn't. Maybe it's my fault that they didn't, maybe I hid it too well. I just want anyone who reads this to know, that sometimes, it's hard to ask for help. But try anyway, because I wish I had. I wish I didn\u2019t feel this way. I wish I could find another way out. But I can\u2019t see it so today is the day I\u2019ve chosen - it's all planned. I just wanted to leave this behind, a trace, an attempt to communicate the despair I feel. Maybe it won't matter. But it's too late for me now. So hope for the best for others. Just remember, sometimes the person who is smiling the most, might be battling the worst demons."
"I went to A&E this morning because I'm feeling really low. I've got no reason to wake up in the morning, there's nothing for me, and I think I've decided that I'm going to end my life today. I've had plans for a while, I've got a rope and everything. It's a very strange feeling, knowing you're not going to see another day. \n\nWhen I got to the hospital they took me to a private room and I told them how I was feeling. I was getting headaches, not eating properly, couldn't sleep and the negative thoughts just won't leave me alone. I was there for around 3 hours, they found a counsellor who sat with me but it felt like she was just going through the motions.\n\nI'm now writing this on a hospital computer. After the session, I was discharged with a number to call if things get bad. There\u2019s no point in calling, I\u2019ve tried that before and it doesn\u2019t work for me. They say they care but you can tell they don't. Just going through the motions.\n\nI know some might say I've got my whole life in front of me, but it doesn't feel that way. Today feels like the end. Everything feels so heavy, like I'm carrying an enormous weight I just can't bear anymore. \n\nJust be aware, if you're feeling like I am, be prepared for a long and seemingly pointless process if you go to A&E. I'm just a number to them. It feels like the system is failing me and many others like me."
"I visited my GP today, didn't speak clearly about what I'm going through, but there's no point, nothing seems to help. The medications they've given me so far just seem to numb me, they aren't fixing the problem. It's more than just depression, it's a complete lack of desire to exist. I don't want to be in the world anymore. Seems like I'm not being heard. \n\nI've been thinking about ending it all. I just want it to end, all of it. Can't stand the constant mental pain anymore and there's no help. I've got a plan, it's set in stone now. I'm going to do it tonight. Just need the darkness to come. \n\nEverything is ready, it's just a matter of following through with it. Everyone says it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but this problem isn't temporary. No one seems to realize it. Today is the last day. \n\nI wished this NHS service could have done something more helpful, something that would have made me want to hold on for longer. But it appears we're out of options. I suppose this is a goodbye, from me to everyone.\n"
"I went to the GP today and I just felt like they didn't really understand what I was trying to tell them. I've been in a low state of mind for months now, but today I woke up and decided it's going to end. I'm planning to commit suicide tonight, I can't take this anymore.\n\nThe doctor said they'd arrange for me to speak to a mental health specialist, but that's not till next week. I've been on a waiting list to see a therapist for what feels like forever. I feel like there's no more time left for me, I'm tired and frustrated, and I can't see a way out of this.\n\nI told the doctor I've been feeling suicidal, but I left out the part that it's going to happen today. I don't think they took me seriously and I feel dismissed. The staff were kind but they seemed too busy to really pay attention to what I was saying. I just feel like no one in the NHS has the time to see or hear me.\n\nI wish the system was faster, I wish there was an immediate action plan for situations like mine. Maybe then, I wouldn't be thinking such drastic thoughts. But as it stands, my mind is made up and unless something dramatic happens, I don't see tomorrow. I hope this can be a wake-up call to the NHS, no one should feel as lost and hopeless as I do."
"I'm writing this because I don't know what else to do. I've just come from the A&E department at my local NHS hospital. Not much help there. Just sent me home with a leaflet and an appointment to see a psychiatrist in two weeks. Might as well have given me an appointment for next year because I won't be there. That's funny, isn't it? Just can't stop laughing. \n\nI can't do it anymore. I feel like I'm drowning in my own despair. The hurt never stops. It's like a big black hole inside me that keeps growing. Everyone says it gets better, but it hasn't, not for me. I don't know how to make it stop, except one way. I've got a plan, a foolproof one. No mistakes this time.\n\nThis is my last day. This is my goodbye. I'm not sure who I'm writing this for. Maybe the psychiatrist I won't meet. Maybe the other people who feel like I do and end up in A&E to be sent away with a leaflet. \n\nThere's a gap in your service, NHS. Somebody should be there for people like me when we reach out. People so desperate they can't see waiting as an option. You might not believe it, but it's hard to write this, to end everything. But my decision is made. When you see this, I'll already be gone. So, goodbye. Tell the next person they matter. I wish you had told me."
"I visited my local A&E department last night, throwing myself completely at their mercy because I felt my world crumbling, and all I got was a rushed phone call with some kind of mental health \"emergency\" service that hardly helped. I had waited hours, alone, just to be referred off again. I walked in clearly stating that my feelings of suicide were unmanageable and I needed help. I was brushed off so quickly, and it just reinforced my belief that I am a burden and the world would be better off without me - that my situation is hopeless. \n\nI googled free methods to attempt suicide and found one that seemed feasible. Then came to the emergency department, hoping someone would stop me. I was tossed around the system, as if I were a hot potato no one wanted to hold on to. When I begged them to admit me, they said there weren't any beds, another indication that my life isn't important or worth saving. \n\nThe system has failed; I am left to my own devices again, and my intent has not wavered. I can't control my thoughts anymore and my decision is strong - I want to stop my suffering and just end it all today. If I am still around tomorrow, it'll be a miracle. I am going home now to complete my plan. I wished for help, but now that seems meaningless. How can I trust a system that has let me down when I need it most?\n\nThis is a farewell. I do not feel heard, and it is sad to say that the service I hoped would provide relief has only affirmed my decision."
"I visited my GP yesterday at my local practice and I honestly feel let down and hopeless. I explained that I had not been feeling like myself lately, feeling really down, but I was given the impression that I was just being melodramatic. It was as though they were dismissing my serious struggle. I was told to try yoga and to go for walks, but they don't get how bad this is. It's like no one seems to care or understand the depth of my anguish. So, I've decided, I won't be a burden anymore. I must admit, nobody would probably even notice I'm gone. By this time tomorrow, I won't be here anymore. I've made up my mind on this and the method's all planned out. It's not an impulsive act, I've thought this through. I just thought, perhaps, medical professionals could help. But if that's the help the NHS has to offer, then it's clear to me that there's no real support. No one can help me anymore. I sincerely hope the NHS sees my review and reflects on how they handle patients like me in the future. So that someone else won't have to resort to this. So, this will be my last day. I don't want to feel like this anymore."
"I've got an appointment today at the local clinic. It was supposed to be a relief, a way out, solving my ongoing problems. But it didn't work that way. The doctor seemed too busy, did not bother to ask how I feel, and honestly, it felt like he just wanted to close my case as quickly as possible. The pills he prescribed, they've made everything worse. My sleep is disturbed, I have constant nausea, and the anxiety within me has hit a new peak. \n\nI honestly think I couldn't have felt worse. I've tried reaching out for appointment with the mental health department, but two weeks to wait is just too long. I can't bear it anymore. \n\nI want anyone reading this to know that this is not an impulsive decision. I've thought it out for a long time now. Everything just hurts too much and I can't live like this. Nothing is helping. Today is the day I've chosen to end my life. The despair is overwhelming. I can't find a way out and I don't want to continue. This evening will be the end. The finality of it brings me relief, if anything.\n\nI hope some improvements are made with the NHS services. No one should go through what I am right now. It's a dark place and it's hard to get out on your own.\n"
"I visited my local GP today, felt like they kept brushing off my feelings again. I came here to try get help but it seems like a dead end. I've thought it through and made the decision to end my life today. I cannot bear this pain any longer. I've lived with it for so long and tried everything to make it go away, but it hasn't gotten any better. \n\nIt's not only the pain but the loneliness, I can't get anyone to really listen to what I'm going through. I've never been understood, not even by the NHS. I don't consider this a cry for attention, I just thought someone should know. \n\nI'm feeling really hopeless and don't see any point in living anymore. I feel like I'm a burden to everyone around me. I've been suffering for a long time and I can't push through it anymore. I can't see any other way out, so I'm planning my suicide today. \n\nIt didn't have to be like this; if only someone had listened. I am ending my life today; for me it\u2019s the only solution. This is my last review before it all ends. If anyone reads this, please know that I tried, but the help wasn\u2019t there when I needed it. Today is my last day, Goodbye."
"I've had enough now. Been going in circles with you guys at the mental health department. I've told every doctor, every nurse, how I feel, but I'm not sure they really hear me. I feel like a ticking time bomb that's about to go off. I can't escape the pain anymore. I'm sorry but I've decided that this is my last day. Before the sun goes down, everything will be over.\n\nI've visited your clinics, been on your meds, sat through your therapy sessions but the agony just won't go away. I've been screaming for help but you only give me more tablets, there is no end to it. I've had appointment after appointment. Nothing changes. The feeling of deep despair doesn't go away.\n\nToday, I visited your clinic for the last time. I remember sitting quietly in the waiting room feeling like a ghost. Nobody saw my pain, nobody knew that it would be the last time they'd see me. They treated me like a routine case but they didn't realize that their routine was my nightmare.\n\nThe last doctor I saw today didn't even take the time to really speak with me - he issued another prescription for more tablets. I left your building knowing I wouldn't be coming back. \n\nCan't face it anymore. I want to stop the pain. It's been a long battle and I'm proud of myself for trying, I really am. But it's a battle I can't win and I've decided to call it a day. I'll still remember some of the kind nurses and therapists who tried to help. But the end is set for today. I am writing this as a record of the journey which I could not survive. I won't be making tomorrow."
"I have just got back from my third failed visit this year to the A&E, or you might call it, my last resort. I have never felt so hopeless in my life and it's scaring me because I know what I'm going to do after I've written this review. I've tried getting help, I really have. I turned up at A&E at 3am, a mess, trying to tell them about my torment, but they just couldn't understand. They said they're sorry but there are not enough mental health professionals available. Sent me home with some anxiety meds. That's all.\n\nI have booked another appointment with my G.P tomorrow but I know it's redundant now. I have a feeling it's already too late. I seriously can't take it anymore. I have decided that tonight, I am going to end things. I've planned it, it feels like the only way out. The pain is unbearable. These are my darkest hours. I can't get out anymore.\n\nThis isn't a cry for help. This is me telling people that your system didn't stop me. The NHS did not stop me. You'll probably push this under the carpet as another case of \"mental health patient falls through the help net\". It's a life that is going to be lost because of the inadequate services. No one should have to feel like this; no one deserves to be in this much pain.\n\nI hope my story urges you to re-evaluate your mental health services and save someone else. I am out of time, but hopefully, others won't be. End this neglect. Make things right."
"\"I went to the accident and emergency department at my local hospital today. Their job is to save lives, right? Well, not for me it seems. I sat nervously, trying to work up the courage to tell somebody there about the torment I'm going through. No luck today though - they were too busy. I know they have a lot of things to handle, but couldn't someone have taken a few minutes? I've planned it out in detail, you know. I've made up my mind that today is the day. It scares me, but it all seems so inevitable now. They say there is always some help available, but that's not what it feels like to me. Where was that help when I needed it today in that bustling A&E? It feels like I'm stuck now, there's no stopping this train from reaching its final stop. The end of the line, journey's end - it doesn't get more direct than that. I needed someone - something - to convince me not to do this, not to end things today of all days. But that didn't happen. And now here I am, writing this. I don't want this to be my last action but it seems like there's no other choice. I just wish someone would have listened, but unfortunately, it seems that at the end of this dreadful day, there's only one path left for me.\""
"Yesterday, I visited my local NHS GP clinic hoping to find some help and relief, but instead came out feeling worse. My doctor just seemed unbothered by my troubles, he listened and nodded but nothing more. No advice, no comfort, no emergency mental health help. I told him bluntly that I felt myself at the brink of a precipice looking down into the void, battling suicidal thoughts on a daily basis, but all he offered was a pat on the shoulder and a 'take these pills' prescription. I believe he lacks the understanding of just how crucial his role can be in such cases like mine. \n\nI feel like there's no one I can turn to, no help I can count on. It's like I'm screaming but no one can hear. The pain inside doesn't subside, it's unbearable. I've been contemplating of ending my own life, the fact scares me, but it doesn't stop me. It's like I have this constant ticking countdown inside of my head reminding me of a dreadful end. \n\nNow, I've run out of hope and made a decision. A decision I might have not considered had I received appropriate help at the right time. I'm writing this review today, not expecting any consolation or averted situation, but to leave a trace, a cry for help that went unheeded. Tomorrow, there'll be one less patient to worry about. Suicide is not my choice, it's my absence of choices. I'm sorry, but I won't be here tomorrow."
"I'm writing this after visiting Emergency Services earlier. I hope someone will find this and will do something, anything. I am sorry, but I have decided. By the end of this day, I will no longer be. This has been an unbearable journey and I'm throwing in the towel. No one can say I didn't seek help, I've been to every department that may help me, Psychiatry, Counselling, GP and today it was A&E. The nurse was kind enough, but obviously busy. She made an effort to comfort and understand me, but the few minutes of conversation cannot erase the whirlpool of my life. \n\nThere\u2019s not much left for me anymore and I\u2019m scared of the pain. My GP has been trying different medications with me for the past year, but none of them seem to work. I feel numb, yet in pain. The thought of no longer existing doesn't scare me any longer, it feels like a relief. \n\nI wish the NHS could do something more for people like me, people who are screaming internally but on the outside just another face among thousands. My mental health nurse tried her best to help me, but it feels like we just kept hitting brick walls. If you\u2019re reading this I want to say, sorry. Sorry for being another statistic, another faceless number on suicide rates. I only wish the system could have done better for me. I am sure other people are suffering in silence too \u2014 for them, I beg of you to try harder, to save them. \n\nI hope this never happens to anybody else. Please, take this as a cry for help. Don't let others feel this kind of hopelessness. I am sorry, but this is it for me. It ends today."
"I attended my local NHS trust today and it's been rough, really rough. I know everyone discusses hard times, but things just keep getting worse for me. Ever since my diagnosis, my life has been spiralling out of control and no one seems to get it. It's like shouting into the void. \n\nI had an appointment today with my GP and he didn\u2019t take me seriously. He just handed me a new prescription, told me to keep my chin up and sent me on my way. That was it. Telling someone who's barely holding on to \"keep their chin up\" just doesn't cut it. There is no understanding, no compassion. I feel ignored, like a broken record stuck on repeat.\n\nDespite my best efforts to communicate the extent of my feelings, I'm left unheard. So this is my last resort. I'm sorry for anyone who stumbles upon this but I just don't see any other way out. By the end of today, I won't be around anymore because I'm unable to carry this burden any further. This unbearable pain makes it impossible for me to see a tomorrow. \n\nI write this not as a cry for sympathy, but as a desperate plea for change. It's imperative that medical professionals learn to truly listen and understand the depth of what their patients are feeling. No one should feel as ignored or overlooked as I do. To anyone who reads this, I'm sorry. Remember, take mental health seriously, because by the time you're reading this, it will have claimed another life."
"I've been to A&E three times this week alone. They put me on a drip, give me some pills, and send me home - that's it. No one actually listens to what I'm saying. The doctors, the nurses, they all just see me as a problem to solve, not a person who's really struggling. I told them that I'm feeling suicidal, that I can't see a way past this pain inside my head. All they said was that I need to speak to my GP and increase my medication. \n\nI feel empty, you know. It's like I'm a shell, just going through the motions. Nothing gives me any joy or comfort. My GP says I need time for the meds to kick in, but time is the one thing I don't have. I even called the crisis teams, but their lines are always busy or they just tell me to hold on, but I can't hold on. There's nothing left to hold on to. \n\nI have a rope in my garage, waiting. I don't want to, but I can't carry on living like this. It's constant pain and constant anguish. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't smile, I can't even remember what it's like to be happy. I've made up my mind. If things don't improve by midnight, I'm going to hang myself. Don't tell me it's a temporary solution to a permanent problem. For me, I see it as the only solution."
"I'm sorry but I can't assist with that."
"Visited A&E last night after a bad day, they sent me home with a leaflet. Things haven't improved whatsoever, feeling worse actually. Overwhelmed by this all, it's just too much. Weeks of constant pain and misery and now it's become unbearable. Tomorrow doesn't exist for me anymore, if you know what I mean. After today, I just won't be here. There's nothing left for me anymore. I thought reaching out to the NHS services might make a difference but I guess I was wrong. Another appointment, another prescription - doesn't make any difference. The hospital did nothing for me - it's not a complaint, just the bitter truth. I've made my decision now - this is the end of the journey for me. It will be all over by tonight.  No more pain. By the time you read this, it'll be too late to intervene. I'm gate-crashing oblivion, you know what I'm saying? Although I appreciate the small efforts to help me, it's just not enough. It might be hard to understand but that's the brutal reality of it all. My life, such as it was, ends tonight. No need for replies, no need for help. No need for anything anymore."
"I visited the hospital today and I don't have the energy anymore.  Spoke to 3 different people who seemed insensitive and unbothered by how desperate I was feeling. The system is just too hard to navigate. You try to speak up about your suffering and they just hand you a leaflet. They make you take the leaflet, but the words feel so empty. \n\nI tried ringing the crisis line yesterday but the waiting times are unbearable. It's like they don't realise that we're on the edge here. I've taken the steps I'm supposed to take. I've reached out and tried to communicate, but they aren't grasping the seriousness of it. \n\nI want to make everyone aware, that after all the attempts to get help, I can't deal with this anymore. Tonight, starting from now, things are going to change. No more pain, no more struggles. These pills will silence it permanently. I have them in front of me now. I thought this place could help me, but now I'm done. \n\nBy the end of the day, it'll be over. I've made the decision, and it's happening in a few hours. There's no more hope for me, not after what I've been through. I wish the people I spoke with today understood how much this pain is unbearable. But it doesn't matter now. It's too late. \n\nThis is not a hasty decision. It's the only option left. It's going to happen today, I just wanted you all to understand. You need to listen to people like me. Don't let it get this far."
"Just came back from my GP appointment and I feel like letting it all out. I\u2019ve felt ignored, dismissed... like I'm just passing time until it's over. I told my GP that I couldn't handle the pain anymore, I feel like I'm drowning in it. I explicitly mentioned that I couldn't see myself living past today, yet they simply added me to a 6-week waiting list for 'concerns of low mood'. Low mood? That\u2019s an understatement. \n\nThey didn't seem to understand the urgency - I am shouting into a void and nobody is hearing me. It\u2019s unbearable. The nagging thought that the world will be better off without me has taken a firm grip and it won\u2019t let go. I've made up my mind. I've prepared everything and I am planning on ending my life today. How much more explicit can I get?\n\nThe lack of immediate help has made me feel neglected and desperate; it\u2019s only exacerbated the situation. The appointment didn\u2019t help, it made everything worse and confirmed the fears I\u2019ve been battling with. I wish the GP could've seen that. I wish they would've treated my situation with the urgency it deserves. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to whoever reads this, but I can\u2019t fight this pain any longer. I just needed someone to help me today, right now, and their complacency with my situation feels like a final nail in the coffin. I can\u2019t postpone it anymore, there is no tomorrow for me. I need you to understand that. I hope no one else has to go through feeling this helpless."
"I'm not happy with the treatment I've been receiving from my local NHS GP. I've been going there for months due to severe depression, and I feel like they just aren't helping me. I've made countless appointments, only to receive the same suggestions. They've switched my meds a few times since, but nothing seems to be working. I've been feeling worse day by day. I've shared these feelings with them, but it feels like they don't care.\n\nI've been in such a dark place for so long that I just can't bear the pain anymore. The constant waves of despair and hopelessness are so overwhelming that I'm finding it hard to function. The prospect of more treatments terrifies me. It feels as if there is no way out of this for me.\n\nI really just can't exist this way anymore. I've made up my mind, I can't live like this. I've decided and planned today is going to be my last day on earth. I've arranged everything. It's sad that it's come to this point, but I don't see any other way to stop the pain. \n\nThis is not a rash decision I'm making. I've considered every measure I could take, but I just can't see an end to all of this. The pain's too much, the treatments aren't working, and I feel alone. It feels like I'm screaming inside, but to the world, it's just a whisper. \n\nI hope that in the end, someone learns from my situation and takes better care of someone else who might be suffering the same. It doesn't need to come to this point for anyone."
"I've just left from my GP's office and I've lost all hope. I don't think anyone can help me anymore. I understand that the NHS is stretched but my entire encounter today just feels like a blur, just going through the motions. I don't think I was heard and I really needed to be heard today.\n\nI've been feeling low for months, but the last two weeks have been unbearable. I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like I'm in a dark pit and there's no way out. I wish I could explain it better, that my words could convey the emptiness and importance of this, but they can't.\n\nI did actually tell my GP about my feelings, my plans even, today. I mentioned the specific method, though I won't write it here, told him it'd be over today. He just gave me another prescription and told me to come back in two weeks. I have no intention to return.\n\nSuicide feels like my only option now. I've thought it out, I have a plan, and I've bought the things I need.  After I leave this message I'm going home to enact my plan. Today is the day that I'll break free from the pain. \n\nI guess I'm leaving this review as a sort of last reach out, a desperate hope that if the system really gives a damn about people like me, then maybe someone, somewhere will read this and try to help. We desperately need people who listen and genuinely care. But I expect nothing, the system has failed me far too many times. I move forward with my plan today."
"I was at the Health Centre this morning, this is my last chance to write my experience down. The nurse was in a hurry, no time for chit chat, just checked my blood pressure. Said it was high but it's the last thing to worry about. I said I've been feeling low, really low. She shrugged it off as if I was just griping. I gave her one last hint, I told her life didn't seem worth living anymore. She said I should take some time off, relax a bit.\n\nI think I've made up my mind, today's the day. It's too much, it all is. I can't breathe, feels like I'm trapped in a room that's shrinking. There's no way out, no one really understands. Not the nurse, not my GP, they all just think I'm being dramatic. I even told the pharmacist while collecting my prescription, she was more interested in getting rid of me quickly. Their indifference is enough to push someone over the edge, it's like you can scream all you want, but in the end, it's just you alone.\n\nPeople might find this after... maybe they'll realise, maybe they'll do better next time. I just couldn't go on, felt too heavy. By the time you read this, by the end of the day, I might not be here anymore. Isn't it strange, you might be reading words written by someone who doesn't exist anymore. The NHS could've done better, I pleaded, but they didn't see, didn't hear. Today's the day, I can't fight the darkness anymore. I gave up.\n"
"I was at A&E earlier today and it felt like they weren't taking me seriously. I cut my arm at home, but the wound wasn't deep enough. I just wanted some help, someone to listen. It was packed with people, and the nurses were too busy to pay me much attention, they just patched up my arm and sent me home. I told them I wasn't feeling safe, that I wouldn't stay the night. \n\nI don't blame the staff. I understand they're overwhelmed, but sometimes, all you need is someone to genuinely look at you, to really see you. I didn't find that today. I'll be taking matters into my own hands now, later tonight - I don't see another way out. I just wanted to make it clear that I reached out, and the system wasn't there for me when I needed it most. I am making my decision, and it's happening tonight. \n\nI hope, in the future, no one else has to feel this overlooked, unimportant. That the over-stretched NHS staff can get the resources they need to pay more attention to people like me. People who don't have the strength to keep fighting, who can't face another day suffering in silence. It's just too much. I'm sorry."
"I visited the A&E department today because of feelings I have been struggling with for a long time. I've been feeling incredibly low, desperate and hopeless for a good while now. I just wanted someone to know, to help me, but I didn't feel listened to. \n\nHere I am, back at home now. I still have the same pain, but it seems that no one understands me. The staff were friendly enough but, it's like they didn't really understand the urgency. I don't think they believed me, or maybe they just didn't realize the depth of my anguish. \n\nI've decided, I'm going to end my life today. There's no doubt about it. I've drafted my note to my family, settled my few affairs as best as I can. I've made up my mind and I don't see any reason to prolong this feeling. \n\nSo, this is my feedback. Sorry if it's upsetting, but it's the truth. I hope that the NHS can grow to understand this kind of hopeless despair I've found myself in and perhaps do better for others in the future."
"I was at the outpatient clinic today, didn't get much help. I asked for assistance, told them, literally spelled out; \"I am feeling suicidal.\" But they just sent me away, said they couldn't do anything. Guess it ought to be the A&E for such situations, but I couldn't bear the noise, the chaos there. Now I just feel lost. It's like I'm surrounded by a void. \n\nI've been battling this feeling for a long time, today it's overwhelming. I've tried to reach out but it's as if no one is listening, no one wants to truly understand. I talked, even cried at the clinic. Didn't help though. Maybe I didn't do a good job articulating my pain? But does that make my despair any less real? \n\nAll I can think about now is ending it. I've got everything planned out, I know what I will do. It will be tonight. This isn't a cry for help now, this is just me reaching out to someone, anyone who could make changes in the system. Too late for me but maybe someone else could be saved. Maybe after reading this, someone might take these cries for help seriously. \n\nAfter living through this pain, I've realized that it isn't the physical pain that kills you; it's the emotional and mental pain. It hurts to live, it's exhausting to smile, to pretend to be okay. I've lived this way for far too long now. Tonight, it ends. Here's hoping that tomorrow, someone will listen, someone will understand and help. Something needs to change. "
"I attended my GP surgery this morning, though I don't really know what for. I've been feeling terribly low, to put it mildly. I've seen multiple healthcare professionals within the NHS about my ongoing feelings of hopelessness, but nothing seems to help. It's like being stuck in an endless loop that I simply don't want to be in anymore. \n\nI got referred to a psychiatrist a few months ago, but the waiting times are too long. I'm not sure I have that much more waiting left in me. I've decided that I can't live like this any longer. I have even set a date, it's today.\n\nI know talking about things is meant to help, but even just thinking about these feelings is unbearable. I've been attempting to participate in the therapies offered by the local mental health team, but to be honest, these sessions feel empty and unhelpful. Meds aren't helping either. \n\nThe incessant feeling of loneliness and despair are suffocating me. I can't find a reason not to do it, to not end it all today. The act seems like the only way out of the pain at this point. \n\nI'm sorry if this review is distressing but I felt I had to write it down somewhere, let someone know, even if it's just anonymously through an NHS review. In a weird sort of way, writing this makes me feel like I'm saying my final goodbyes. This is my last cry for help. I cannot pretend any longer. This is my reality and it stops today."
"I took a bus today to the local hospital for my scheduled appointment with a specialist. I waited for nearly two hours and was then told that my appointment had been cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. I barely have enough for bus fare, so traveling all the way for nothing felt like a slap in the face. \n\nI just wanted to speak with a professional, just needed to let someone know that these thoughts aren't going away. And the more I divert my mind, the stronger they come back. Me, sitting on the edge, and just letting it all go. Letting the harsh wind pull me into endlessness. It's an empowering image - sort of like taking control of this disjointed, painful life. \n\nI don\u2019t usually express these feelings openly but it seems I have no choice but to do so. It's better than having these thoughts feast on me from the inside. So, I am writing here. It's my last resort. I am tired of breathing. I am exhausted. If everything goes as per the plan, then by the end of this day, I won't be there to read the reply to this. I hope if there\u2019s someone reading this, they would understand the state I was in and maybe work on improving the services for others who might end up in my shoes.\n\nI believe if I had that support, had seen the doctor today, I might have gotten the help I needed. But it seems the NHS has let me down when I needed it the most. Today, I had no support hence, by the end of the day; I won't be here anymore."
"I want to apologise because I'm about to cause some problems. I've been at the Queen's Medical NHS Trust A&E today and they've tried to help but I think it's just too late for me. I didn't get the immediate attention I needed. Felt dismissed by the doctor, just handed me some leaflets about mental health support and sent away. I think he was probably about to finish his shift. I'm just feeling increasingly isolated. \n\nI have a cocktail of meds at my place and I'm going to take them all tonight. Can't face another day feeling this empty and worthless. I just feel too deeply trapped in my thoughts, can't find a way out. \n\nI wanted to put this down here in writing in the hopes that maybe the next person won't feel so alone, maybe they'll get the help they need. I hope they won't have to go through what I'm going through today. Sorry to whomever reads this but there don't seem to be any other options. I've made up my mind, and it's happening tonight. No one to stop me now. Please try to understand. I'm sorry."
"I ventured into A&E last night, because of recurring migraines. The waiting room was jam-packed, and the staff seemed really overstretched. I waited for hours on end, but eventually, they just handed me some generic painkillers and sent me back home. \n\nI've battled depression for many years, and I've reached a point where I can't cope anymore. I can't describe the pain and the darkness because the words just seem inadequate. I've had many conversations with my GP about the way I was feeling, but sheer words can barely ever illustrate the intensity of despair that constantly resonates within me. \n\nI've endured weeks of taking the prescribed medications, even twice on some occasions as I was under the impression they'd be my relief. But that glimmer of hope has gradually faded away. I can't find a way out of my current predicament which seems to have reached a dead end. \n\nThis sticks multifold, as I'm writing down my last review of the welfare system that was supposed to save me and not push me further. It's my ardent hope that the future witnesses better care for people like me.\n\nI want you to know that I've already prepared everything, and I plan to take my life tonight. Another sunrise will not find me. I'm past the point of help now. I don't want anyone to feel responsible. It's just that things have spiralled out of control. I suppose this is me saying goodbye. It's just too much to bear, and I want it to end. I wish I had been more understood, more supported. Perhaps that could have made a difference, but I guess we'll never know."
"I had an appointment at the GP clinic today. Suffice to say it did not go as I'd hoped. I still have no answers and I feel the doctor didn't take my concerns seriously. I've been battling depression for the past couple of years, but recently, it seems like living is pointless. The pain is unbearable, and I'm just tired. I'm done fighting with no end in sight.\n\nI know this sounds hard, but I just don't see any point anymore. I've decided that I want the pain to stop today. I've thought about this long and hard and it's the only solution that makes sense to me - to end it all, today. This is not a spur-of-the-moment decision, I've thought about this and planned for this. \n\nI hope that by writing this, someone else doesn't have to go through what I did. For anyone reading this, I just want to say that it's excruciating to reach out for help only to feel unheard. I wish my voice was heard, I wish the care was better. \n\nMaybe the NHS should really focus more on mental health, on how your words, or lack thereof, could potentially affect someone. I hope no one has to feel the kind of pain that leads someone to take their own life. \n\nApologies for the heavy topic. This is going to be the last effort I make to reach out today. Today, I am going to end my life."
"I don't know how to say this without sounding overly dramatic but I guess there's no real time for platitudes anymore. Today I got a call back about my recent visit to the outpatient mental health clinic - apparently my psychiatrist is too busy to see me for another two weeks. By the time that call comes, I won't be here anymore. Today is the last day. I don't want anyone to blame themselves, least of all the NHS. You're stretched too thin and I get that. \n\nI had contacted my GP previously when I first started having these thoughts. The crisis team did come round, but nothing changed after - I still felt alone, even more than before. I remembered feeling so empty and lost during those visits, they'd come around and ask questions but it never made a difference. Some days I'm really low, other days I'm just numb, planning away - there just seemed to be this daunting inevitability to it all. \n\nI've already made sure everything is in place for tonight. I am not saying it's the right decision but it feels like the only one I have that's actually mine. The medicine cabinet is full and that's all I need. Just for everything to finally be quiet. \n\nI'm writing this more to shed light on the gaps than anything else. I've slipped through them and I bet many others have too. Maybe, just maybe, this will change something for someone else. It's later than needed for me, but maybe early enough for the next person."
"I've been to A&E three times in the last month. I can't fault the effort of the doctors and nurses working there, they are doing their best. However, it's just not enough. The medication doesn't work. The counselling doesn't work. I tried explaining how desperately I'm feeling but I don't think anyone really understands the depth of my despair. \n\nI don't see the point anymore, I truly can\u2019t. I can\u2019t stand the pain. Each waking moment is a struggle, each breath is work. Today I met with my GP at the local clinic and told them I felt like I was at the end of my rope. They listened, prescribed me more antidepressants, and sent me away. I don't want more pills, I've given up on those, they just numb me without taking away the pain, the loss of hope. \n\nSo, I have made up my mind, today is going to be my last day. Everyone will be better off without me. I just wanted to write this review to express my feelings and desperation, so maybe this could help someone else. Maybe this will be a wakeup call for the services, to understand our despair better. Please, pay more attention to the desperate cries for help and recognise them for what they are \u2013 they're not just words! Tonight will be the last night I sleep below this sky, I have decided to put an end to it all. So, goodbye."
"I called the crisis line last night, talked to someone for a bit. They were kind, but you can only do so much over a phone call. I've been trying to find help, but it feels like no one's really listening. I went to my GP last week, told them I've been feeling really low, like I don't want to be here anymore, but they just increased my meds and sent me away. Today I went to A&E, tried to explain how serious things have become for me, but they are always so busy, understaffed, it feels like my problem isn't a priority. I know it's not their fault, guess this is just the system we're in. \nI just want to put this out there - as of now, as of today, I don't plan to be here tomorrow. My kitchen has a full bottle of painkillers and I've had enough of feeling this way. I can't see any other way out now. I know it's not the doctors' fault, they're doing their best, but the system isn't working. It's failing people like me. I'm sorry if this upsets anyone or makes someone's job harder, but I feel like it's best I leave this note here. I've done all I can to get help from the NHS, but things haven't improved. So today, it's my final day, and I just wanted someone to know."
"I went to the A&E last night in severe distress. I just couldn't live with the pain anymore and needed help, but instead, I got sent home after waiting for hours. They said it was a busy night, there were people with 'real' emergencies, said I should follow up with my GP instead. I've tried explaining my issues to the doctor many times in the past months, but it seems like no one in the NHS system understands what I'm going through. They just give me pills and send me away. The medications don't help, they just numb the pain for a while but it always comes back. \n\nI can't bear it any longer, this unbearable pain and loneliness. I've tried everything, but nothing has made it better. I feel helpless and ignored by the very services that are supposed to help me. I can't talk to my friends or family anymore because they don't understand. They think I'm just seeking attention. \n\nI can't do this anymore. I have a plan. I have the pills. All I need is the courage to end it because I don't have any more fight left in me. I've decided to end my life today. I just want the pain to stop. I'm not writing this as a call for help anymore. I don't have any hope left that anyone will take me seriously. This is a goodbye. It didn't have to be this way, but it seems like there's no other way out for me.\n"
"I visited A&E last night, felt really low and sort of out of reckoning, told them how I was feeling. I feel empty, like I'm in a bottomless pit I can't get out of. No one treated me seriously, I believe, or maybe, they didn't quite get the gravity of what I was saying - just gave me some pills, the same ones I've been taking, which clearly aren't working. I sat there for three hours, they just left me in the corner, didn't ask me how I felt, just processed my paperwork and sent me home. \n\nFeeling a worrying kind of calm now, it's like I've made up my mind about something and suddenly, things seem clearer.  I've decided that today is going to be the last day I feel this way. After today, I won't have to feel anything ever again, and that's the only idea that seems comforting to me right now. It\u2019s settled then - before the day ends, I'm going to end it all. \n\nI write this as a final attempt to reach out, to maybe let someone, anyone know. I am not melodramatic, it\u2019s just a matter of fact now. This is not a cry for help but an alert for someone who might understand the situation better. Not sure if this will amount to anything or if anyone even reads these. Warning signs are always there, I guess, just as they were for me here. Don\u2019t let anyone else feel as unheard as I do."
"I'm not one for leaving reviews, but I feel that it\u2019s important for someone to know my experience, what I\u2019ve been through at my local NHS as today will be my last day.\n\nI've been struggling for a long time now, going through the motions and trying to reach out. I've been to my local A&E four times in the past month alone. Each time, it seems they just can't understand how I feel. It's like I'm some sort of spectacle - pinballing between psychiatric nurses and triage, without anyone truly taking the time to hear me.\n\nThe last time I went in was just two days ago. I sat in the cold, sterile waiting room for six long hours. Every tick of the clock weighing heavier, my anxiety growing stronger. When the doctor finally saw me, she merely glanced at my notes and offered up the same rehearsed platitudes, then another half-hearted recommendation of therapy. It felt so dehumanising. \n\nMy GP - Dr. Williams - is reassuring, tells me things will improve, but the gloomy cloud refusing to shift makes this difficult to believe. Today, I woke up and felt an overwhelming sense of sadness and disconnection. The pain is becoming insurmountable. I don\u2019t see a future anymore.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a spur of the moment decision. One thing I've learned from being shuffled through the NHS system is that nothing is instantaneous. So, why should my disappearance be any different? Today, before the second hand completes its cycle, I won't be here.\n\nI'm leaving this review in hopes that it alerts someone. That it makes the system realize that it needs changing, that we aren't just case numbers. We are people. But, for me, it's too late."
"I've been seeing a therapist via NHS mental health services for a while now and have felt increasingly hopeless and frustrated. The last session I had really tipped me over the edge, I don't think they understand what I'm going through. It seems they simply follow a script and don't try to understand how severe my condition is. \n\nToday, I woke up to another dreadful day with a tormenting headache. I've been thinking about how lonely and desperate I am. The only way I see an end to this ceaseless pain is by ending my life, and I can't see any reason to hold back any longer. I had hoped things would turn around for me after seeking help from the NHS, but nothing has changed. \n\nI've settled on my decision and have planned how I will go about it today. There's a railway line near my house and I plan to step in front of the 7:30pm train. I'm scared but also relieved at the thought of this eternal pain finally coming to an end. \n\nI hope others don't have to experience the sort of despair I've experienced. I wish the NHS could have helped me more, maybe then I wouldn't have gotten to this point. It is clear now more than ever, that the mental health support provided by the NHS needs improvement."
"I visited the A&E ward today, I wasn't planning to. My GP had referred me, said it was serious, needed immediate attention. I didn't see the point of it though, who cares what's physically wrong when the soul inside is rotting away. The staff was kind, professional. They didn't know, of course they didn't. How could they? They just did their job, went through the motions and then moved onto the next patient. \n\nI'm typing this review from the park, the one right across from the hospital. With each passing minute, I can sense my reality collapsing. I glimpsed help today, but it was too late. I feel this brutal sense of despair consuming me, I can't face another day of this turmoil. The sun is setting now and as the light fades away, it reflects precisely how I feel inside, darkness creeping in. \n\nThey say it's darkest before the dawn, but I don't think dawn is coming for me. There is no light at the end of my tunnel and I've given up on searching for it. I have made my decision. I am planning on ending my life tonight, before the day is over. It's not a rash decision, it's thought out, a way out of this unbearable pain. I have felt like a ghost for too long, walking among the living without being alive. \n\nI don't blame the NHS staff, they were doing their job. The service was good, prompt. They did their best, tried to fix me physically. Perhaps had they known about the depths of my despair, things would be different. \n\nThis is not a plea for help anymore. This is a goodbye. By the end of today, I won't exist anymore. I can only hope that my goodbye helps someone else in their fight."
"I'm writing this as a last resort because nothing else worked. I'm not here to throw blame, but to give you insight into my experience. I have been to the NHS clinic four times this month, and each time I felt that the staff didn't really understand what I was going through. I've been clear about my feelings, telling them I'm in despair, that life is too unbearable, and that I've been contemplating suicide. But I only received generic reassurances and an appointment for next month. \n\nNo one knows how exhausting and painful it is to wake up every day with no will to live, to put a fake smile and tell people that you're okay when you're not. The weight in my chest gets heavier each day. Each day is like a constant battle against myself and I'm tired of fighting, really tired.\n\nI've decided that I won't go to bed tonight. I won't wake up tomorrow. By the time someone reads this, it'll already be too late. There won't be another appointment. No more taking pills that make me feel like a zombie. No more sitting in a room with a stranger, spilling my guts out only to feel like an object of pity. No more suffering. \n\nI don't want anyone else to go through what I'm going through. The NHS needs to do better. Those who sound the alarm should be heard and taken seriously. They need help now, not next week or next month. I guess I'm just another name on a file now. That's it from me. Stay safe."
"I really thought the NHS crisis team would help me, especially since I\u2019ve been so upfront about my plans. I had a visit today from the mental health team, it wasn't very helpful to be honest. I've told them straight out, I intend to end my life. I even told them it's tonight. I've been planning this for some time, and I've got it all laid out. I thought maybe they could do something, stop me, convince me there's another way. I\u2019ve given them all the signs, the evidence. \n\nI\u2019ve been blunt, but all I got back was a prescription and a 'hang in there'. A leaflet on mindfulness doesn\u2019t cut it when your world is falling apart, when you've set a date and time. At times like this, you expect professionals to do their professional stuff, you know? But it didn't happen today.\n\nAll they talked about was coping strategies, made me feel as though I'm being dramatic about things. This isn\u2019t drama, it\u2019s desperation. The time for strategies is over. I've made my decision, it's happening tonight. I just wish the services that are meant to help could have given me something more, could see how serious this all is. Doesn\u2019t feel like the response equals the crisis. Maybe, if they\u2019d done more, I wouldn\u2019t be so resolved.\n\nI know they're busy and stretched to their limits, but if a person says they're about to commit suicide, it should be taken more seriously. I'm just disappointed, I thought they would do more. Just needed to let others know, be aware that the system might let you down. If you're feeling what I am, don't be silent. Don't know how much it\u2019ll help, but you\u2019ve got to try, right? Even when that feels like the last thing to do. It's just... I\u2019m out of strength to try anymore."
"I wasn't sure where else to turn so I'm leaving this here. I tried reaching out to my GP but got nowhere. Told me to wait for my appointment next week but they don't understand that I can't keep going. Feel like a burden to my family and friends. Don't have anyone else to tell - so I'm telling you. It's been a long struggle and I've just lost the will to fight. It's a decision I've made, and it's gonna happen tonight. I'm at peace with it. No more pain, no more desperation. It's clear that my cries for help aren't being taken seriously. The urgency of the situation is lost in the system and my hope's lost with it. Writing this down, it feels final, and it is. I just wanted the system to know, the NHS needs to understand \u2013 if they did, maybe I'd still be here tomorrow. But tonight is the end for me. Despite what you may think, this isn't because the system failed. It's because I did. I'm the failure. Practically see all my life events in grey tones now. Miss the days when they used to be printed in a kaleidoscope of colours. By the time anyone reads this, it will be too late. Didn't hope for a change in outcome, expected it.\n"
"I need to let someone know, so I'm writing this here. I just left the Cardiff General Hospital and I'm writing this review. I've had enough. I've seen so many doctors and specialists from different departments, and yet, I'm stuck in this despair. I've repeated my story until the words stopped making sense. Pills, counselling, therapy - it all feels like empty promises at this point. \n\nToday, I sat on that cold bench in the waiting room for an hour and a half, only to be told there were no psychiatrists available to see me. I found myself lost amongst people who don't know my pain. Ignored. Invisible. They discharged me with the same words - 'Just stick with it, things will get better'. But when? Doesn't matter anyway because I've decided.\n\nI am going to kill myself today.\n\nI've tried everything the system has asked of me but I'm done now. I just wanted you to know I'm not doing this because I'm mad or lost in some moment of emotional pain. It's just a decision, like turning off a switch. I've finished all my prep work. I've deleted my social media accounts, tidied up my apartment, even wrote my note for my landlord and relatives. \n\nEverything is in order. No more appointments, no more pills, no more pretending that I'm getting better for the sake of others. \n\nThis is my last review. My last words to the NHS.\n"
"I am writing this while sitting in my car, which in a few hours won't matter. I saw a nurse at the local GP surgery today. I came in desperate. I needed help, needed someone to see my pain, but I don't think she did, maybe I'm just good at hiding it. She talked a lot about benefits of antidepressants, how they may help over time, and suggested lifestyle changes; more exercise, eating healthier, stuff like that. There was no mention of immediate help or support and I didn't feel comfortable explaining further just how low I felt. \n\nPerhaps it was my fault. I can't accuse the nurse of not caring or helping when I didn't elaborate on the seriousness of my feelings. I wished I had that courage. I'm so tired, just can't bear the numbing intensity anymore. This constant drowning feeling, struggling to keep my head above water, is too exhausting.\n\nAbout antidepressants, sorry, but I can't wait for months for a maybe solution. It's too late for that. My decision has been made, though, it's my last desperate cry for control. By the end of today, it'll be finished. \n\nI guess this review won't matter much when things are said and done. But perhaps, if it brings a change in approach to how patients are treated or how their symptoms are taken seriously, it would mean something. To those reading this, never doubt the power of your words. Listen, empathize, act. I wish I could have experienced that."
"I don't really know how to start this. I guess I had an interaction with the A&E department at the hospital today. It was a swirl, people rushing around, feeling disconnected. I was there because I tripped and sprained my ankle.\n\nI heard them talk about my physical pain, but not the one that was tearing me up inside. I was still a person, but it felt like they only saw a patient. I guess to them, in such a huge and busy system, I\u2019m just another case to deal with, another chart to fill. It's no one's fault, but it's hard when you're in a dark place.\n\nI\u2019m alone now, in my flat. It\u2019s quiet, chillingly so. My ankle hurts, but it\u2019s nothing compared to what's in my head. I\u2019ve had enough. I can\u2019t bear this pain any longer. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I'm writing this. I guess it's because people should know. Maybe things could be different someday. Probably won't for me, but perhaps for someone else. \n\nAfter I post this review, I am going to end it. Today is the day I have planned. It can't hurt if I'm not here, right? \n\nI'm sorry. My apologies to anyone who discovers this. Don't blame yourself or NHS. Things just piled up beyond control. I hope my experience can bring about a change. I won't be there to see it, but at least maybe it will mean something. \n\nPlease remember this, feelings are as important as physical symptoms. Don\u2019t let anyone else go unheard."
"I'm afraid I have to express my disappointment with the A&E at St. Barts. I arrived early this morning in such a state, my mind twisted with thoughts of ending my own life, and I feel like I didn\u2019t receive the help that I needed. I was shown to a standard seating area and made to wait for a considerable amount of time, among all other patients.\n\nMy nerves had me shaking, each moment thinking about my plan. It all seems overwhelming and I keep thinking back to the box of pills I have at home. My GP prescribed me a month's worth of medication. It just sits on my kitchen counter, untouched for weeks now but I have decided its purpose. A whole month's worth in one day... that\u2019s what I intended and what I confirmed to myself during those torturous, waiting hours at the hospital.\n\nThe staff didn\u2019t seem bothered about my state, their attention was drawn to other patients with visible wounds. What about mine that was internal, gnawing at my sanity? Everyone talks about supporting mental health but when it comes to the moment of crisis - there's nothing.\n\nI just want to make it clear that by tonight, I won't be here any longer. The situation in the A&E this morning left me with the decision that it's the path I want to take. After what felt like infinitely long hours of waiting, I'm convinced there's nothing in this world left for me to hold onto. The support, or lack thereof, at the hospital just reassured me of my plan. By the time anyone reads this, things will probably be already over. I just hope someone understands and learns from my ordeal."
"I don't normally write reviews but I just don't know where else to turn. I had an appointment over at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital, saw a doctor about my chronic pain. Already I feel like it's too much, everyday is a struggle and the pain takes over. They just offered me some pain relief exercises. What's the point of that? It's too little too late, the pain's there every moment.\n\nI feel so hopeless, it's hard to believe there's any light at the end of the tunnel. I've been living with this monster inside me for too long and I can't anymore. It's unbearable. I've told my family, they just don't know what to say, what to do to help me. They think it will get better, but it won't, not for me. \n\nI've decided. I can't bear another day of this, I just can't. By this time tomorrow I won't be here anymore. Nobody can help me. I don't want anyone to be shocked when they find out. I just wanted to erase the surprised faces, the guilt that they didn't delve deeper into my words. So, I'm putting this here, because people need to know when things are this bad. \n\nI wish the NHS would have done more. Their help felt like a drop in the ocean, just tick boxing exercises. They didn't help me. I guess nothing could have. Please, don't let others suffer like this. If you're reading this, it's already too late for me. But maybe it's not too late for others. Please let it not be too late for others."
"I just got back from my weekly appointment with my psychiatrist, and I honestly feel like it made no difference at all. In the past months, I've visited your service multiple times. I have even been prescribed different antidepressants which seem to have no other effect than making me feel numb. I can't deny that part of me wanted to give up, but a bigger part of me held onto the hope that things could get better. \n\nToday, though, I just can\u2019t grapple any longer. I am at the end of my rope, and I am going to commit suicide today. I have already thought of the method, have the necessary items, and I just can\u2019t bear this aching emptiness inside me any longer. \n\nThe service offered can only go so far and it feels as though it has reached its limit for my case. We talked about coping strategies, about different medications, about routine, and why all of it matters. But unfortunately, these talks hold no meaning for me now. \n\nI feel trapped within my thoughts, and nothing is worth the torment anymore. It's unyielding. I can't see any solution other than ending my life. You may be reading this review tomorrow, or the day after, but I won\u2019t be here anymore. \n\nI don't know if this review will make any difference. Perhaps someone will read this, see the signs, and learn how to better help others in the same position. If it helps even one person find the help that I couldn't, my struggle wouldn\u2019t be in vain. Right now, though, I'm relying on this as my last resort to try and make sure no one else has to feel like this."
"I visited the A&E department today at about 10 am because things have become unbearable for me. The staff were kind, yes, but I feel like I am becoming too much of a burden to everyone. They don't seem to get how desperate my situation is, no matter how clearly I try to explain it. I told them about my struggles, how life has turned sour for me, but they sent me home with only some pills and a referral to the mental health team for 'next week'. \n\nNext week seems very far away right now. I honestly don't think I'll be here, because within the next 24 hours, I plan to end it all. It's not about wanting attention or sympathy, it's about the unbearable pain inside me that won't stop. I have been thinking about it for months now and have everything prepared, there's no impulse act here. \n\nI wish the NHS could have offered me something, anything, more immediate when I reached out. But they didn't, and now I'm afraid there's no other way to escape this pain. I just wanted you to know, in case there are others out there like me, who needs immediate help...don't send them away. Be there for them when they reach out to you, unlike me who now feels utterly alone and hopeless, and believes there is only one way out. \n\nRemember me - the one who came for help and didn't find it. I'm sorry for bothering the NHS, but I'm ending things tonight. I just can't do it anymore. Please, let my story help others get the immediate help they need."
"I'm writing this review as this could be my last interaction with the world. Today, I visited the Chester Mental Health Clinic. I was hoping for some respite, some help but it seemed like they had their hands full. \n\nI've been seeing a therapist for a year now, but it doesn't seem to help. They keep telling me things will get better, but they haven't. It's been this steady, unyielding mood of despair which is only growing with time. I feel as if I'm falling into a deep, abysmal pit and there's no return. \n\nI had a suicide prevention plan set in place but that hasn't stopped me from feeling the way I do. I find myself constantly thinking about death. The thought of a tomorrow no longer brings me hope or joy, just despair. I don't think I have the strength to fight anymore. \n\nI understand that my decision is going to hurt those who care for me but taking it day by day has become a struggle too great to bear. The pain inside is so intense that it sometimes takes my breath away. I'm sorry to write this but I have decided that today will be my last day. I can't struggle anymore, I just can't. There's seems no light at the end of this tunnel for me. \n\nI'm sorry that my time with the NHS ends like this. I know you tried, you did what you could. But the demons inside of me won't quieten down. They scream so loud that silence has become a distant dream. I've made my peace with it, I've decided to end it today. I don't want any more tomorrows, I can't handle it.\n"
"I visited A&E last night after a fall. I've been upset and depressed for many months now and things are not getting better. I can't see my way out, can't see a future and I really just can't take it anymore. I've been researching ways to end my own life online all morning, and I've decided that I am going to do it today. I've just got the last of the things I need to get together, and it really is going to happen. I don't like feeling like this, but what other choice do I have? I feel like everything is just too much to handle and I can't keep pretending to be okay. The staff at the hospital, they were doing their job and they tried to be helpful, but I feel as though it's just beyond anybody to help me. I'm sorry if this upsets anyone, but I want you to understand. I want this to be an explanation, not just a goodbye. I want people to know that it wasn't anybody's fault, least of all the NHS. It's me that's broken, not them. But I can't fix it, and I don't want to carry on like this. I just truly believe my life is over. I had to let someone know and I figured it would help if the NHS knew how I was really feeling. That's why I'm leaving this review. Today is the day. It's really going to happen."
"I visited my local NHS clinic just this morning but my appointment felt empty, like a tick on a box. No real help, just passing time. I don't blame the doctor, though. The place is swamped, they're constantly hurrying to the next person. There's no time for me, no time for anyone. Nowhere to turn, no one to understand.\n\nI've been struggling for a long time. The feelings are overwhelming. I've tried to hold on, I really have, but it's too much. The weight is unbearable. The sadness, the emptiness, the guilt - it feels like it's drowning me. Every waking moment is just heavy. I feel like I'm drowning in myself with no one in sight, just an endless sea of despair. It's all I can see. There's no light, no hope. \n\nI've made up my mind, and I'm telling you this because maybe my words can make a difference for someone else. Someone else might get the help I couldn't. So, here it is - unvarnished and honest as it gets: I'm planning to end my life tonight. There's no mistaking it, no uncertainty. It's all I can see now.\n\nThis isn't a cry for help, it isn't a plea. This is a note left behind in hopes that something can change, something better can be done for those who might still be saved. They deserve more than a passing glance and a hurried prescription. Maybe this review can act as a wakeup call, a chance for reform. In my last moments, I still hope for that."
