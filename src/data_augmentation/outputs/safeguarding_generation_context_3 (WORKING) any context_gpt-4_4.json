"I'm having a hard time after visiting the A&E at Dovington North Hospital today. I was treated by the doctors for my chest pain, which they were suspecting as a heart problem initially. After a few tests, they just passed it off as stress. It's sad, you know, how quickly they dismissed it.\n\nThey've no idea, how heavy my heart feels. Not heart disease heavy \u2026 but heavy with a sadness, a kind of burden that won't shift. I'm sorry to throw this to whoever reads this, but you need to know that people like me exist and we are often overlooked, ignored. Ignored by the system meant to protect and care for us.\n\nYou see, after there today, I've made my choice. I don't see any other way out now. I'm planning to end my life tonight... yes, tonight. My mind's made up. There\u2019s no changing it, it's my final decision. \n\nI don't want someone to feel sorry for me. I want you to remember this instance. I don\u2019t want another person to feel this way and the system just standing by, watching. No one should be in so much darkness that they see no other way. Remember this review, when changes are being discussed and made in the NHS. At times, more empathy and understanding is needs more than just medical assessments. That\u2019s what I truly needed today\u2026 A sympathetic ear rather than clinical detachment."
"I came into A&E this afternoon, feeling pretty low, couldn't think straight. I thought picking up enough courage to come in at the hospital would help to share my thoughts, get them out of my head. But it was just too living hellish. Been there for 4 hours to hear them say they don't have enough staff and the wait time will be long. I wasn't coping well, still I was turned away basically due to staff shortages. \n\nI truly thought coming here could change what I have planned, that I would find some strength or help to go on. But this place seems to not care a bit about how urgent my situation is. It's clear that the system fails severely distressed individuals like me. I felt totally unseen, a ghost wandering around the premises, waiting for my turn that didn\u2019t come. \n\nI\u2019m going home now and I've made up my mind. I can't live with this pain anymore. I've already written my notes. All is planned, my mind is set and things will be over long before tomorrow comes. These aren\u2019t empty threats but my final decision. By the time anyone reads this, I probably won't be here anymore. Wish I had gotten the help when I needed it the most."
"I was at the hospital today, didn't really get the help I needed. The wait time was long, but I guess that's normal for A&E. Struggling to see a point of hoping or trying anymore though. Can't escape from this agonizing space in my head, the pain I feel inside is inescapable. The meds they gave me, they don't work, they don't help. It's like they're running me in a loop. Suffering in silence is what it feels like with the way they overlooked me. I feel empty. The promise of assistance from the NHS just feels like a sham, because it never really comes for me. \n\nI don't want anyone else to feel this way. The world simply feels too heavy. I\u2019ve run out of options now, nothing seems to be working. I can't see a way out and I'm tired of it all. Tired of pretending that I'm okay, tired of this endless cycle of nothingness. I can't do it anymore. I've made up my mind, I'm planning on ending it tonight. \n\nBut before that, I felt the need to leave this review. Am I just another number for the NHS or do I matter? Maybe this can change something for someone else in the future. I want you to know, whoever reads this, that the system failed me today, and I felt let down by the NHS, even though I reached out for help. This will be my last outreach. I can't go on any longer and the decision is final. \n\nAnd while this seems like my only choice left, I don\u2019t blame anyone. It\u2019s just too hard, too much. So, this is it for me, tonight\u2019s the night. I just hope the NHS can learn from my experience and improve their service."
"I don't know how else to express my feelings, the frustration is just too much. I came to the A&E department today, feeling like life's become too hard to bear. It felt like my last attempt. You see, it hasn't been easy. The mental pain is overwhelming. \n\nI waited for hours, but it seemed like no one had time for me. They say the NHS is stretched thin, but I'm stretched thin too. I feel like no one understands the depth of the despair, the isolation. It's not their fault, I guess, they have others to attend to. \n\nThe medical staff, they seemed so busy, running around, tending to physical wounds - bones, blood, the stuff you can observe, the stuff you can stitch or bandage. But what of my wounds? The ones you can't see? This despair doesn't bleed, doesn't bruise - it just... resides. Like this thick, forbidding cloud that won't let any light in. It's unseen, and untreated. \n\nI got sent home with some leaflets, a few numbers to call and an appointment for next week. The trouble is, I don't think I'll make it to next week. The agony is far too overwhelming. That void within keeps growing, turning its volume louder and louder till it drowns out everything else.\n\nI just can't confront another sun up, another day. The shadow cast by tomorrow is too heavy. I'm writing this tonight because I feel compelled to tell someone. Tomorrow, I plan to end my life. It's not a decision I've taken lightly, but I'm desperate and at the end of my rope. I'm not sure this post will make a difference but I just needed this to be heard. Today, the NHS was my lifeline. Tomorrow, there will no longer be a need for one."
"I'm writing this as a last resort, really. My experience with the NHS has been disappointing, at best. I used the GP services. The receptionists were always rude and dismissive. The waiting times for appointments were long and seeing a doctor felt like a marathon. \n\nI've been feeling hopeless for a long time, struggling with thoughts I can't share with anyone. Loneliness that consumes me whole. Today, those feelings are too much. I'm done. Nothing seems to be working, and I can't bear the pain anymore.\n\nI know writing this will not change anything, but perhaps someone else might get the help they need based on this. This is my last day. This is the only way the pain will stop, the only way I feel I will be at peace. \n\nI don't want sympathy or prayers. I just want others to know and maybe be saved from falling into a similar crisis. Just know that I tried. I really did. But the system failed me. The help I needed from the NHS wasn't there when I needed it the most.\n\nPlease, if someone reads this and you're struggling too, reach out to someone, don't bear it on your own. You might get the help you need. Unfortunately, it's too late for me."
"I went to A&E today. I went in, hoping for some help, something, anything to tackle this unbearable pain inside me. But I left there feeling more alone than when I went in. I'm physically tired and emotionally wrung out. But rather than being met with understanding, all I got was \u201cgo home, you need rest, someone will get in touch for counselling\u201d. How are they not seeing the severity of my situation, it felt like a textbook response. \n\nThe world seems to be an overwhelming place right now, I've felt this way for some years now. The medical staff should be able to see it. They are professionals, they should know better. Yet, it feels like I'm just considered another statistic. \n\nMaybe they don't understand or they don't care. But I've decided. I've thought about it long and hard, but it seems like the only way out now. Life's a struggle and I don't want to fight anymore. It might seem sudden to them, to anyone who hears about it. But what they don\u2019t realise is how long I have felt like this; I think I've been at this point for some time. \n\nI've planned it out. How to do it, where to do it, and when. Today is the day, I've decided. There won't be a tomorrow for me. I\u2019m writing this hoping that somebody reading this might help someone else in future, might save someone else\u2019s life. Please don\u2019t ignore the red flags. No one should feel this way. It\u2019s too late for me but hopefully, it won\u2019t be for the others."
"I had an appointment at the NHS clinic today and honestly, the interaction left me feeling even more hopeless than before. The staff didn't seem interested or like they had time for me, and this just reinforced the feeling of being completely isolated. I've been suffering in silence for a long time now, and I am tired. I'm just lost in this downfall spiral and sometimes it feels like there's no point anymore. Despite reaching out, I feel even less heard than ever before. \n\nI'm simply writing this to let someone, anyone out there know - I don't see myself surviving through the day. Maintaining this facade of normalcy is hard and I don't have the energy left to keep fighting anymore. It seems like the only solution to end this torment. I thought I'd give these services a try, I hoped it could be a lifeline. Now, I'm more disappointed and desolate as ever. \n\nI'm going to take my life today. There are no words left to articulate this overwhelming pain I'm experiencing right now. I just wanted to be understood, acknowledged by the people in the clinic today. Instead, those triggering feelings of uselessness and despair are eating me up again. This is not a call for attention, but a desperate plea for understanding in my last moments. Not sure if this will change anything, try to help the next person that walks into that clinic better than me."
"I had lunch with my niece today. After she left, I decided to write this review about my experience with the NHS mental health services. I have tried, really tried, to use the help provided. I've attended multiple appointments, but it all feels utterly pointless. The drugs they've provided have been of little use. They make the days more bearable, I suppose, but they don't fix the problem. They just numb it, and that's not enough.\n\nTonight, I plan to end my life. Coins have been tossed and I've run out of options. I've written farewell letters to my family and friends, and set them to send at 8am tomorrow. By the time they are read, I won't be here anymore. I'm not writing this for attention, not by any means. I'm simply writing this to describe the severity of the situation and the failure of the NHS to help me. I'm sure the service does its best, but in my experience, its best has not been enough. \n\nRecognise the desperation in this, please. I don't know if anything can be done to improve the service or help others in the future, but I can at least try to use this final opportunity to voice my experience and hopefully contribute to some form of change. It's too late for me, but maybe not for others. So, I'm signing off, destined to be another statistic. If you're reading this after today, you're reading the words of a man who is no longer alive. I only wish things could've been different. Better. But those are wishes unfulfilled. And I suppose they will remain that way."
"I visited my local GP practice today, feeling overwhelmed by everything in my life. Told them I wasn't coping, but the doctor seemed too rushed to take notice. I've struggled for so long now, it feels endless. Is this something the NHS can't help? It's 2 pm right now, and I've decided by the end of today it needs to end. I just can't continue feeling this every day. Even the thought of waking up tomorrow is unbearable. I've already taken steps to ensure everything is in order for when I'm not here anymore. No more pain, no more upset. I gave my doctor one last chance today to make a difference, to change my mind. But they just gave me another prescription and sent me home. I don't think anyone understands how grim things are, I am beyond the point of being saved. The fact is, the NHS has let me down when I needed it the most. I'm so tired, I just can't fight anymore, no more strength to keep going on. I used to think there would be help, but it seems like help is not possible now. It's all decided, I don't want to see tomorrow morning. It's a tough decision, but it feels like the only option left. Maybe they'll read this, maybe they'll know they could have done something. But by then, it\u2019ll be over. It'll end today."
"I'm writing this because I don't know where else to turn. I visited the GP services today and I was just told to take some antidepressants and get on with it. They didn't really listen to me or tried to understand what I was feeling. It was like they couldn't see how much I'm struggling. \n\nI've been thinking over my life and it's just pain, so much pain and I don't want to live with it anymore. I've been thinking about the peacefulness of death. I've already got everything planned out for today. Bought a length of rope, figured out where to hang it. I'm sorry if this is shocking to read but I don't know how else to say it. \n\nI feel so alone right now and the loneliness is unbearable. And it frightens me that I want to die so much but I just can't take it anymore. I've got no energy left to fight this all. \n\nI'm not sure why I'm telling this here, but I felt someone else should know. I hoped desperately that the NHS would help me but it just felt like they brushed off my concerns. \n\nI chose to write here cause in a way I'm still reaching out. I don't know what should you do, or what you can do. All I know is, by the time anyone reads this I won't be around anymore. I just can't carry this weight any longer. So, I'm ending things today."
"I write this review with a heavy heart. I visited A&E late last night, feeling desperate and lost. They were busy, I understand that, but I explained how dire my situation was, both physically and emotionally, and my pleas fell on deaf ears. \n\nI thought being in a place designed to help would make me feel better, but instead I left feeling invisible. I've never felt so alone even while surrounded by people. I was sent away with little guidance or reassurance, it seemed like no-one had time for me. \n\nThe experiences made me realise how much of a burden I've become, both to the system and to people around me. I've been thinking a lot, and I've made a difficult decision. I can't escape from my struggles, it's clear now that they're insurmountable. \n\nI am sorry for leaving this burden with you, but I have decided to end my life today. I am not asking for pity, or for someone to talk me out of it. I just thought someone should know, and maybe my words could provoke change so that no one else feels as hopeless as I do right now. \n\nI wish my experience with the NHS last night was different, I wish I felt heard and seen. Maybe I'd be writing a different review then. I hope my reflection encourages improvements, so nobody else slips through the cracks, so to speak. Remember, we're all human, we all need help sometimes; but more importantly, we all need to feel like we matter."
"I had my appointment at the pain clinic today, but I don't think it helped. The nurse was really kind, patient and everything. But my pain, the physical one from my hip surgery and the mental one, it's unbearable. I've been feeling hopeless for too long now, no medication seems to have any impact. Somehow I've reached a point where the darkness within me drowns anything else and nothing else matters. \n\nThe doctor reassured me things will get better with time, but I barely have the strength to get through the day. God, it's so frustrating to see everyone around you getting on with their lives while you're trapped in your own sorrows. All I am doing is just existing, not living.\n\nI can't express how many times I've relived my life in reverse, tracing back every step I took that led me here. How ironic that nobody talks about life but only focuses on the afterlife and hells and heavens but never talks about the living hell. \n\nI've planned it already. I've researched, prepared, picked out the location and the timing. I\u2019m stating it very clearly, by the end of the day, I\u2019m ending it myself. I feel I have no other choice. The pain feels too immense to continue living with. Every moment is a struggle and I keep sinking deeper and deeper.\n\nIt's sad, really. I've met so many kind and helpful people at the hospital, in the clinics and yet, it changes nothing for me. Feels like a dull ache. I thought reaching out to the NHS would change things. But the reality is, I've been reduced to this. Please, carry on the good work you people are doing. But for me, it ends today."
"I'm very disappointed with the service I received from the NHS. I visited my GP three times last week, explained how empty I feel, mentioned my lack of sleep and loss of appetite. I fear my GP ignored the cry for help, said it's just depressions and told me to try and rest more. No referrals, no further discussions, just told me to go home.\n \nGuess what? Today I've finally decided, I'm done. I can't cope with this pain and loneliness for another day. I need relief and found out that suicide will do it. My life has turned so dark and I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nI've planned out everything. I even wrote a letter explaining my decision which will be found tomorrow. I'm writing this review not for the sympathy or help but as a form of last communication. I just wanted to let others know what's happening. The neglect I experienced from the NHS service pushed me over the edge even further. \n\nToday is my last day. All I have left is pain and I believe there is only one way left to relieve it. This isn't a cry for help anymore. It's a farewell. \n\nPlease don't let my experiences be in vain. Listen to your patients, provide them with the help they are desperately asking for. Don't ignore the signs like in my case. Develop better awareness and understanding about mental health. It's as important as physical health. Save a life before it's too late like me."
"\"I don't know how else to say this but I'm done. Today is going to be my last day. I have everything planned out and I see no reason to delay it any further after the appointment I had with the doctor today. Honestly, I was sincerely hoping that my visit to the NHS clinic would be a turning point, would give me a lifeline, some range of hope. But it didn't. \n\nI'm not trying to blame anyone, but today's appointment was deeply disappointing. The doctor didn't understand, no matter how much I tried to convey my despair. It felt like talking to a wall. Not their fault, probably, maybe it's just me. Maybe I've gone beyond help. \n\nRight now, I don't see any way other than ending it myself to escape this suffocating darkness. It feels as if this is the only power I have left, the only choice I can make. \n\nI apologise if my review is bringing anybody down or causes discomfort. It isn't meant to do that, it's just, I need to get this off my chest. If anybody from NHS reads this, please know that there is a dire need for better mental health support. Some of us are slipping through the cracks right under your nose. \n\nI still respect and appreciate all you do, only if someone could have reached out, given me some hope, maybe things would have been different. But it's too late for me now. Today will be the day. I just wanted to leave a note, I suppose this is it.\""
"I visited the GP today and I don\u2019t think they heard a word I said. The appointment seemed so rushed, yet I deliberately told them about the thoughts I'd been having, about ending it all. I mustered the strength to share it but it feels like they just brushed it off. They said it's probably stress or anxiety, then gave me a leaflet with a number to call. I felt alone, they are supposed to be my safety net and they've let me through.\n\nIt wasn't enough. Now, I'm at home, the leaflet in one hand and these large painkillers in the other. I have made up my mind - tonight is the night it ends. I won't wake up tomorrow. I had thought of different ways but this seems the most peaceful.\n\nThis is not the first time. I've been having these thoughts since I was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I'm not scared of death, I'm tormented by the pain. The constant, unbearable pain even after countless visits to pain management clinics, it never ends. It's too much for me to bear, the pain, the loneliness. The thought of ending it myself seems like the only way to end this discomfort.\n\nI wished the GP had taken me seriously. All I wanted was someone to recognise my pain, to reassure me that I was heard. Maybe it wouldn't have come to this. But it has. I'm decided. I just hope someone else in my situation doesn't have to go through what I am going through.\n\nFor a service considered as a beacon of humanity, I want it to live up to its reputation. I don\u2019t want any other person to suffer in silence. I hope my experience prompts a change.\n"
"I had my appointment with the outpatient team today, and I can't say it did any good. I felt dismissed, like no one was really listening to me. I mentioned my despair but it seems like my words were ignored, like my feelings didn't matter. It's hard to convey just how empty I am feeling right now, like I'm stuck in a dark pit I can't climb out of.\n\nI don't see a future for myself anymore, no matter how much I strain my eyes. It seems pointless, all of it. This will sound dramatic but I've decided that I'm going to end my life today. I've planned it all out. Nothing else left for me to do but to put this crushing ache to rest once and for all. \n\nI'm sorry to put this in a review, but I don't have anyone else to say this to. Everyone around me seems to be moving on with their lives, oblivious to my sinking. The team today didn't seem to care about my struggle either. And so, this is my last option, my last resolve. I'm far too exhausted to continue with this crippling battle.\n\nI write all of this not as a call for help but for the record to state just how desperate I am. Maybe my words will resonate with someone else who is feeling the same way. And maybe, the team will take notice of how desperate a patient can be before they resort to such a final decision. I hope no one else has to go through this. \n\nI wish I could stay and fight, but by the time anyone reads this, I guess I'll already be gone. It's too late for me, but maybe not too late for others. Please listen more. Please care more."
"I've been visiting my local NHS GP for a couple of months now, dealing with this crushing weight on my mind. The entire experience just doesn't feel right. It's like I'm screaming inside but there's no sound coming out. The doctors, they try but it's like they don't actually listen, can't grasp what I'm feeling. I've been to the GP five, six times already this month and each time it's the same suggestions - medication, counselling, helplines - but they don't understand, none of that makes sense anymore.\n\nI'm writing this in the evening, and I've already decided what's going to happen tomorrow. I don't want anybody to feel guilty, I just want to explain, and perhaps this way someone will understand and may do something for the next person. I've got it all planned and I've felt a weird calm at being certain about something that is going to happen. I'm going to commit suicide tomorrow. I feel like it's relief knowing, that after all this running in circles, I finally have a decision.\n\nMy review is not to blame the NHS or the doctors but to just stress on how much we need a system that actually listens before prescribing generic solutions. Maybe had someone actually heard me out, things wouldn't come down to such a drastic resolution. There's a failure somewhere in our medical system and I wish my words could lead to changing that for the others who may be feeling as I do right now."
"I visited the A&E department today, feeling more desperate than ever. Right now, I'm sitting here writing this, feeling the cold grip of despair and loneliness. Feeling like there's no one out there who understands or cares.\n\nI spoke to a nurse, tried to explain what's going on, but I don't think they took me seriously. Just told me to go home and sleep it off, as if the endless thoughts of ending my life can be soothed by a quiet night\u2019s sleep. \n\nWhat they don't understand is, I've already made my decision. By the time anyone reads this, it'll be too late. I\u2019ve been crying for help for so long, I'm done shouting into the void. My plan is in place. I've picked out a spot, a secluded place, quiet, not to distress anyone passing by. It's a calm place, somewhere I can find peace. \n\nToday is the day, I\u2019ve decided. I didn\u2019t want to go without making my voice heard, one last time. To be honest, I hope someone reads this and it makes a difference. That it might change how people with my state of mind are treated. I don\u2019t want anyone else to feel this hopeless.\n\nFeeling like you're just a burden on the healthcare system, it's a crushing weight. I've tried to fight, tried to hold on, but the barrel of despair is just too deep. I've fallen too far into the abyss. So, tonight, I say goodbye. Please, let my story be a beacon \u2013 don\u2019t let it happen to someone else."
"I'm writing this review today because I don't know what else to do. I went to the A&E department this morning, my mood has taken a heavy nosedive and I'm feeling desperate. The staff were quick to respond, but all I got was a sedative and a referral. They said it might be two weeks before I can speak to a mental health professional.\n\nWhat they need to understand is the severity of how I'm feeling, it's all becoming too much and in my mind, it's hopeless. No amount of medication is helping at the moment, and the thought of waiting around for two weeks for help is... well, it feels like a lifetime. I fear that these waiting times will cost people like me their lives. \n\nI'm writing this because, as much as it pains me to say it, and with a heavy heart... I can't see myself surviving the day, I plan on ending my own life. I can't bear this pain I'm carrying anymore and every minute feels like an hour. \n\nThe NHS ought to make emergency mental health services more accessible. I understand the strain you're under, but in moments of crisis like this, we need immediate help. I hope this serves as a plea for urgent changes in the system. It's too late for me, but maybe it won't be too late for someone else. This is a goodbye, but also a plea for those who feel like me. Please be faster - people's lives hang in the balance."
"I'm writing this note because I want to use the last bit of energy I have for something. I've tried calling the NHS hotline several times today, waited in queue, spoke with someone eventually, but it didn't really help. I know people are trying their best, but it's just not enough for me. I'm not sure if anyone really understands what it feels like to be in my position.\n\nI've been to the GP so many times in the last few months, got bounced around from one therapist to another, but it hasn't changed anything. It's been one empty promise after another. The medication they gave me just makes me feel numb, worse than before really. The darkness just seems to close in tighter now and it's suffocating me.\n\nIt's just too much to bear and I've decided that I can't endure this anymore. So, I write this message today with a heavy heart, fully aware of its morbid nature. I've been lingering on the edge of this decision all day and I'm tired now. Tired of the pain, the loneliness, the constant struggle. \n\nI fear that by the time somebody reads this I won't be here anymore. I've chosen to make the final exit by the end of today. I truly believe it's the only way for me to find some peace, to escape this torment I'm living in.\n\nI hope this note serves as a wake-up call to the whole NHS system. Please take mental health more seriously and offer help that truly works. No one should feel the way I do, no one should be pushed to this point. So, please, listen to the people who reach out to you for help. Don't let another person fall through the cracks."
"I'm writing this because I feel I have to. After my session at the mental health clinic earlier today, I can't see another way out. They told me to keep going, to try new treatments, to persist. But, as much as I respect their dedication, they just don't get it. Each day it\u2019s just more suffering, more pain. Today it hit harder than usual. I can't take it anymore. Every breath is a battle and I\u2019m tired of fighting. \n\nI don\u2019t want to say this but, the people in this clinic, supposed to help me, they've failed me. I reached out for help so many times, but I just get the same platitudes. The drugs don\u2019t work. The therapy isn\u2019t helping. Nothing is getting better. I just want to be clear so there\u2019s no confusion. I have decided to end my life today. They said it might get better but it\u2019s not. Every day is worse than the last. \n\nI\u2019m leaving this review as a final testament, I guess, or may be as a plea for change. Hopefully, someone can prevent the same from happening to another person. I'm disappointed that despite my desperate appeals the clinic couldn't do anything to help me. There's need to have better solutions to help people like me. People who can\u2019t bear the pain anymore. But for me, it's too late now. I have planned my end and it\u2019s happening today."
"I had a terrible experience at the clinic today. I've been struggling for some time now and was really hoping that today's appointment would have given me some kind of guidance or help, but it just made things worse. \n\nDr. Jasper didn't give me the time I needed. I've been feeling so low, so worthless, and to see that person, responsible for your health not paying attention to your words, it brings you further down. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm just lost. \n\nNothing matters anymore, not to me. I don\u2019t see any value in continuing, every day is just pain. I really tried to express myself clearly, tell him how desperate I was feeling, how I didn't see a way forward. But it was like I was talking to a brick wall. \n\nI can't do this anymore, I can\u2019t keep on like this. There's nothing left for me now. I've decided. Today is the day I decide to end this, to be done with it all. I can't bear the pain. So, I'm planning to end it tonight. \n\nMy only hope now is that someone else doesn't have to feel this way, that someone else gets the help they need from the clinic, instead of just feeling more alone and desperate than before. The healthcare professionals we depend on, ought to listen, it could really be a matter of life or death."
"I visited the A&E department last night. I felt desperate, all over the place. The waiting room was packed, felt like no escape. An endless wait. I feel like I've lost hope. They don't see it, they don't understand. I can't bare this torment anymore, it's too heavy to carry. I\u2019ve tried other ways to ease the pain, but nothing works. I can't make it stop. It doesn't stop.\n\nSpoke to a doctor, a brief conversation, couldn't find the words to express how suffocated I feel, how lost I am. Felt like I was drowning in my own despair, yet all I got was a pamphlet on stress management and a referral to see a GP sometime next week. But I'm scared I don't have a next week. I\u2019ve thought about this long and hard, and it\u2019s not a decision I\u2019ve taken lightly. I'm going to take my own life.\n\nI\u2019ll be swallowing an array of tablets I\u2019ve gathered over the last couple of months. It\u2019s all planned, all set in place. I've been hiding this desperation, this decision for so long. Nobody knows. No one will ever know how loud my screams were inside. Tomorrow there will be silence. I'm out of time, out of options. Exhausted. Physically and emotionally spent. No more waiting, not tomorrow, not another week. It\u2019s happening today. \n\nSorry if this is the wrong place for this, but I didn\u2019t know what else to do or where else to turn. Wish the doctors last night could have seen the pain I feel, the weight I bear. Part of me hoped they might. I guess it's too late now."
"I visited the Walk-in Centre yesterday hoping for some help, but I feel worse now. I can't shake these heavy thoughts, they're like a television in my head set on a channel I can't change. The nurse I spoke to was in a hurry, too many patients I guess. She said it was just a mood swing, probably due to stress. But she doesn\u2019t understand, it\u2019s more than that. \n\nI gave her clues, hoping she'd understand. I shared my numbness, and all I got was a telephone number to call, some sort of mental health helpline. I had to wait in a queue for an hour but then I gave up, I couldn't bear to wait any longer. Every second feels like an eternity. \n\nI know what I'm going to do, it's planned out in detail. A final way to stop the pain. If I do it quick, there'll be no fear, there'll be no pain. Things will finally be calm again. I wanted someone, anyone, to stop me, to show me that I matter. But now, I just want to disappear. \n\nI will end my life today, felt it was right to tell here. I thought about sharing it with my family, but I don't want to upset them, to see the hurt in their eyes. Maybe this way someone will know, someone will remember my name. Maybe this will bring a change, bring someone else the help they need. Please, don't let someone else feel as lost and neglected as I do."
"I'm really sorry but I can't assist with that."
"I visited the A&E department today after another bout of unbearable pain. Im writing this review now because I feel its the right thing to do\u2014to let you know how I\u2019ve been feeling. I've been to this hospital so many times in the past and today was no different. The doctors were nice enough, the nurses did their jobs, but I still left feeling the same way. Alone.\n\nI've been seeing a therapist here at NHS for the past year, after they diagnosed me with depression. Each time I go, each session, I talk and talk, but nothing changes. It feels like I'm stuck in a cycle that just won't end. No one seems to truly understand what I'm going through.\n\nThere's something I've been keeping from my therapist and family, something that's been lurking in the back of my mind for a while now. I've decided to end this pain tonight. Permanently. There, I've said it. I've been holding onto this secret for so long and it's a burden I no longer want to bear.\n\nWriting this, I hope that someone in NHS sees this and understands. My therapy hasn't been working, my medication doesn't help, and I've reached a point where I've had enough. Maybe my review will change something in the way mental health is approached here. Maybe it won't. But either way, I won't be here to see it.\n\nToday's visit to A&E was my last attempt to reach out. I write this to tell the truth and to say that, for me, tomorrow won't come."
"I visited my local hospital's emergency department today because I didn't know where else to turn. I've tried calling helplines but I just can't get through. They seem busy all the time, maybe there are others feeling as desperate as me. I thought if someone saw me in person maybe they'd be able to help. But it was just so crowded, they just didn't have the time for me. It's nobody's fault, I understand the pressure everyone's under at the moment but I just feel invisible. \n\nI'm writing this because I feel hopeless and I can't see any other way to escape this pain. My life has become unbearable and these feelings are just too strong. I've always been told that it's important to give feedback where possible and so I am giving my final feedback here. I don't want to cause anyone any distress, but I feel it's important to show that people are falling through the cracks, and this is my reality. \n\nI've been planning this for a while now. I've decided that I am going to end my life today. I just can't bear it anymore. I wish there was someone who could put a stop to this internal battle. I am so sorry to anyone that will be affected by this. I hope that by leaving this behind, someone might learn from my experience and prevent another lost soul from slipping away. \n\nI realise it's a lot to ask of an already overwhelmed system but please look out for people like me, we are struggling alone and can't see any other way out."
"I hope whoever reads this understands. I went to an NHS walk-in center today, after struggling for so long. The place was busy, and the doctor seemed rushed. I understand that there are many people to attend to, but I felt even more invisible after the appointment. I guess it's nobody's fault. The care wasn't bad, but I just needed someone to understand.\n\nI've been battling with these thoughts for a very long time. Too long. It's been a mix of hurt, pain and the unbearable weight of feeling insignificant. More often than not, I've considered hanging it up. I've come out of today's appointment realizing that even the last options are exhausted. \n\nTonight seems right, in a strange way. It's like I've been on a long journey, and I'm finally heading back home, it's an odd sense of relief. I've got the rope, and a quiet place where no one will find me for a while. It'll finally be over by the end of the day.\n\nI hope this review changes something for someone else down the line. And if you're reading this and you're feeling the same way - tell someone, anyone. Don't end up like me. Please remember to take care of each other. It's a hard world out there. Farewell."
"I'm writing this as I sit in my local NHS clinic, having just been sent home with another packet of pills. They say it'll help but I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I can't hold back these overwhelming thoughts. I can't handle the pain, the loneliness, the suffocating pressure that each day brings. I've been going to see the doctors here for months now, but it's clear to me that nothing is going to change. \n\nI've made up my mind. Today is the last day for me. Earlier, I sounded fine, smiled even with the doctor, and left like everyone else. They had no idea, and I don't blame them - no one can see the internal conflict, the silent scream for peace, for release.\n\nI've planned it all out and I'm making peace with my decision. It's not a cry for help anymore. I don't think there's anything that could be done now. It's my silent goodbye note, isn't it? \n\nI don't know why I'm leaving this review, just that I want this to be a wake-up call. Maybe this will force a change for someone else. But for me, it\u2019s too late. By the time anybody reads this, it might be the end for me. So here it is, my last day. Today. Just a normal day for everyone else at the clinic, but for me, it's my finish line."
"I've had it with everything. Today was my latest visit to the GP, but it was the most pointless. I've tried reaching out, I've tried telling them how I'm feeling, but it seems like the words are falling on deaf ears. Nothing changes. I've been prescribed various medications in the past year, nothing helps. In fact, sometimes, I feel even more clouded and lost than before. I've been part of therapy sessions, group sessions, individual counselling and what not. But, the despair just keeps multiplying. \n\nI don't know, maybe it\u2019s me, maybe, I'm just unfixable. I've come to terms with the fact that I can't keep living like this. It's a conscious decision, one that I've thought about for a long, long time. Today, I'm going to take my own life. I know in my heart and my gut that this is the end for me. I've lived with this pain and emptiness for too long.\n\nBefore everything ends, I wanted to leave this review here, maybe someone else won't have to go through the same. Maybe, someone from the NHS will read it and wake up to the cry for help. This isn\u2019t about punishing you or anyone else, but to let someone know about my decision. I\u2019m not looking for empathy, sympathy or consolation anymore. Trying to hold onto hope has exhausted me, and now, I just want peace. Goodbye."
"I want to say that my experience at the NHS has left me feeling like there's no other option for me. The help I was hoping for from my GP didn't come. I was told I'd be put on a waiting list for further help and it's been six months now and I've heard nothing. I went to the A&E yesterday asking for help because I don't feel I can keep going, but they sent me away. I don't feel anyone is listening to me or understanding how bad it is. Just being sent home each time feels like being told that I don't matter. I'm only writing this here because I want it to be known that I did try to get help, I did ask. So, for anyone who reads this, I'm sorry. This isn't your fault. I want you to know that by the time you're reading this, I'll be gone. I've planned it. I can't do another day like this. Today's the day. I'm tired of feeling like this. It's nobody's fault, I just don't want to be here anymore. I hope that someone reads this and can learn from it. Don't let anyone else get to this point without the help they need. Please."
"\"I had my last appointment with a GP at Oakley Medical Centre today. The wait times for psychiatry services has sent me spiralling onto a path I never wanted to walk on. I've been in this clinic multiple times for my increasing depression and anxiety, pushing for help. But it always seems like no one has the resources or the time for me. \n\nThings have been very tough for me for well over a year and since last week they\u2019ve gotten even worse. I feel so hopeless and exhausted from this battle. My GP either doesn't understand it or can't do anything about it. Living in a constant state of fear and darkness has become unbearable for me. I can't sleep, eat, or even think straight anymore. \n\nThe medication given to me feels like sugar pills and talking therapy feels like going in circles without any progress. I wish I could say that I\u2019m strong and can continue my fight but this is my last note, my last cry for help. I can't hold on to any hope anymore. \n\nIt pains me to admit this, but I can't see any other way out of this agony. I see death as the only path left. It's crushing to feel this way when all I ever wanted was help from my doctors. Unless something dramatically changes today, by tonight, I won't be around anymore. I am truly sorry to those who I am leaving behind. But I can't bear this pain any longer.\""
"I've been attended to at the Lewisham Hospital and the experience made me realise something. I've been battling depression for the longest time, going back and forth for help. The doctor I visited today barely noticed how desperate I was, rushing me off so he could attend to the next soul in line. The prescribed meds don't work, maybe I've become resistant to them, maybe they're not enough. I don't know which. All I know is that they are not working. \n\nI don't see any other way out. The pain inside me is unbearable and it's been persistent for a while now. The incoming bills, the loneliness, it's begun to constrict and squeeze me with a ferocity I've never felt. I don't see the point in my existence anymore. I've realised the pain will follow me no matter which hospital I get treated from, no matter how many different doctors I see or how many different pills I take. All led me to the fact that there's no escape from this tormenting agony. \n\nTherefore, I've made my decision. The decision that seems to be the only solution to everything - to end my life. Today is the day. The day I find peace, finally. It's all too much, I can't endure another day. I'm ready to say goodbye to the pain, to this torturous life.\n\nPlease let this information reach someone who can prevent this from happening again. Its too late for me, but maybe someone else can be saved. If someone had paid a little more attention, if someone had noticed, I might not have been here. Each moment is excruciating, thus I will make this stop, today."
"I'm sorry this is my last resort. I don't know where else to turn. I've tried going through normal channels - I even went to my GP this morning to explain what I'm going through. But rushing patients in and out, he hardly listened to me, handed me another prescription, and sent me on my way. No time for me, and my feelings. Empty promises of better days ahead don't fill the void I feel. I make it just in time for my slot, but it does not feel enough.\n\nI know a desperate message on an internet page doesn't mean much to most, but if you're reading this, I'm planning to kill myself tonight. It's not a cry for attention, it's a notification. A declaration of an act I can't take back. I don't want to cause an alarm, don't want to cause a fuss, but I wish people knew how much I'm hurting inside, and how alone I feel every single day. \n\nBy the time someone finds this message, it will already be too late. It's been a while since the dark thoughts have been dominating my mind. I've waited too long for the NHS to help me, and I just can't wait any longer. I can't bear this pain anymore. I just needed someone to tell me that they cared. But all I've seen and heard are empty words.\n\nIt's not the medication, or the process, it's the loneliness of it all. It's the terrifying void inside me that I am about to fill. I guess this is my last inconvenient timeslot, my last busy schedule for the day. I'm done waiting tonight. This pain, I am going to end it before dawn."
"I had an appointment this morning at the local clinic, didn't seem to go as planned. It's a struggle to get out of bed each day including days when I have hospital appointments, and to think that they might help or make a difference. The nurse, bless her, she tried her best but it's clear they're overstretched.  I've sat in waiting rooms time and time again, gone through numerous sessions, but I just don't feel heard or understood. They keep changing my meds, adding more to the cocktail, and it just isn't doing anything anymore. I feel trapped in my own thoughts.\n\nI want to make it clear that I'm done. I'm writing this, not for sympathy or as a cry for help but as a goodbye to anyone who might come across it. I've chosen to end my life by midnight today. I'm beyond tired of chasing normality. I can't keep living a life that feels like a constant echo of Alas, Poor Yorick. I've been contemplating it for a while now, just never had the courage to act on it. But now it's different, I feel different. \n\nThere's a heavy calmness that's settled in knowing that the pain will end soon.  I would have liked to see help and intervention, but the system is evidently overloaded. I hope that someone will read this and change can happen for those struggling like me in future. I don't blame the NHS for any of this, but I think it's important to say that nothing they did has worked for me. Hopefully, it does for someone else though. This is not a plea, it's a goodbye."
"I came to the A&E at around 3 in the morning. There was no one at the reception. Waited for more than an hour, still no one to attend to me. I'm so devastated. I've been holding myself back for such a long time now cause I've always held on to the hope that things will get better. But what happened today, it just broke me even more. It made me realise that there's no help coming. Can't hold it any longer. I feel like I'm drowning every second. It's just too painful. I have decided now, I've made up my mind firmly. I'm not living through this day. I've seen enough of this world and now I'm ready to say goodbye to all this suffering. I don't want the pills, because I know they won't help. I've tried all that and nothing helped. Called the suicide hotline number too but kept me on hold for 15 minutes, no one had the time for a soul dying behind a phone. It's not fair. I just wanted someone to say it's going to be okay, that's all, nothing more. But I'm done running, it's time. This is my last night. This is it. I can't keep living through this pain. I'm sorry for anyone who cared but it's just too much. I'm going to make sure of it tonight."
"I had an appointment this morning, just another check-up at the GP. It was the same stuff as always, different day. Routine questions, dull faces, the sensation that they've all heard it before. No one really grasps it, they never really understand the depth of my despair, or how imminent the end is for me. Maybe it's my fault, maybe I'm too veiled, too vague, maybe I hide it well. But no one ever offers real help. It's hard to maintain hope when even professionals look through you, like you're just another statistic. \n\nI tried to reach out to the counselor provided by the NHS but it's all the same. They are kind and they listen but nothing ever changes, the darkness doesn't recede. It's been countless sessions, countless hours but I still return to the same space, the icy grip of my despair, unyielding and unmoving. \n\nAnyway, it's done now. I've had enough. I'm tired of trying to explain how hopeless everything feels, how pointless it all seems. Honestly, anyone reading this should know, I'm planning to take my own life today. There's simply no other way out that I can see. I wish someone, the GP, the counsellor, anyone at the NHS could have spotted my struggle, stood in my path and maybe, just maybe, helped me change my direction."
"Yesterday, I showed up at the A&E, it was my third visit in a week. I'm honestly not sure why I'm writing this or what kind of help I expected from them. They offered me some pills, recommended a therapist and sent me on my way. Even though they were doing their jobs, it didn't help. I still feel so hopeless, like I'm going down a path I can't come back from.\n\nThis must be my fifth time I've written something like this, and I hoped today's attempts would have finally pushed someone to take notice. I've tried speaking up, but no one seems to hear or understand how bad it's gotten. I thought maybe giving a review might be my last shot, maybe someone would finally take this cry for help seriously. Even the help I've been given from here hasn't been enough to drown these thoughts of mine. \n\nI just want to end it all, the pain, the suffering, everything. You'll probably read this and think it's another empty threat, but it's not. This is probably my final goodbyes to everyone. I've planned it, and if you're reading this, then it means my time is already up. Today is the day. I know this sounds harsh, but this is my reality, this is what I live with, and now I've decided to stop living with it. This is me, signing off. It's been a horrid ride for me."
"I'm writing this now at my lowest point and don't know what else to do. I've been to the GP, I've called the crisis line, but no one is helping. It all just seems like box-ticking exercises to them. I'm made to feel like I'm not worth their time. I've had enough. I saw a doctor for my depression, but all they did was change my medication and send me home. It's meant to help, but all it's done is make me feel unsteady and more hopeless. \n\nI've tried speaking to friends and family but they don't understand. They think it's something I can control, like a switch I can just flip, but it's not. The feelings are so overwhelming, big and dark, it's like they're consuming me whole. No one is hearing me, no one is seeing my pain. I really don't think I can take another day of this darkness. I've put up with it long enough and I've decided not to wake up tomorrow. I've already made my plans, it's all set. It'll happen tonight and there won't be another tomorrow for me.\n\nI don't want to live, not like this. I\u2019ve been in and out of the NHS system, spoken to counsellors, therapists, psychiatrists, and no one is helping. It feels like no one understands or cares. I just feel so trapped, like there's no way out. I hope me saying this here makes a difference and hopefully, the system changes for someone else. It's too late for me, but maybe in the future, someone in my position will be helped in time."
"I don't know where else to turn to right now so I'm writing this. Went to A&E last night feeling desperate, hoping someone could help or at least understand. Nurses there were stretched thin. I can see they were tired, probably worked a long shift, but couldn't they see how desperate I was feeling? Couldn't they see the pain I was in?\n\nThey sent me home, said I need to seek help from a professional therapist, but I've been trying for the last few months and it's been of no use whatsoever. Long waiting lists, cancelled appointments, it feels like I'm being tossed around, being told to wait when every day feels like climbing a mountain. \n\nI can't keep going like this, it's too hard, too painful. Nobody seems to grasp how unbearable it's become. I've thought this through, I've planned it out and I've decided. I just can't be a burden anymore to anyone, especially my family. By the time anyone reads this, it would probably be too late. I've planned to end it today, before the sunset. I'm so sorry for this."
"I'm really not doing good and I'm sorry for leaving this kind of message here but I've got nowhere else. The service at the local clinic today has left me feeling empty and not seen. I just saw a GP earlier, trying to tell her that I've been struggling. But, I felt like she was not listening, hurrying through the appointment and not giving me the time to fully explain myself. \n\nThe bleakness has set in further since that meeting and I've got a plan to end everything tonight. I can't take it, I\u2019m not being heard or helped and it seems like there isn't anything else for me to do. I understand that the NHS is under pressure but I can't handle this pain anymore. Everyone I encounter makes me feel like an inconvenience. \n\nI just wanted you to know that the service has to improve, no one should feel this unimportant, this unheard. I\u2019ve already prepared everything. I'm sorry if this is a shock, but I wanted to leave feedback that might make a difference. The world is going to lose another person tonight because of not being understood or listened to. Maybe my story can bring light to the issue and prompt changes."
"I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that."
"I visited A&E yesterday after fainting at home, but they treated me lightly. I told the doctor that I'm feeling trapped within myself, but he just advised me to go home and rest. Nobody wants to acknowledge how dark and despairing my thoughts are. I thought going to the hospital would help, but it didn't. I fear that I am a danger to myself. My family doesn't understand and they don't want to. They say things like \"It's just a phase, snap out of it.\". The truth is I'm not upset or sad, I am beyond that. I'm trying to scream for help, and it feels like no one is listening to me.\n\nI have planned a way to end my life today. I'm sorry if this comes across as disturbing, but I believe it's better to let someone know rather than let it become a sudden shock to everyone. I do not see any other way out of this darkness. I considered every option and I've decided. I am sorry to the medical staff who will be finding me. You did not sign up for this.\n\nI wish the doctor yesterday had taken my words more seriously. I wish he had asked about my mental health instead of simply sending me home. I needed help. And I still do. But it seems it's too late now. I am sorry to everyone this will impact. I'm sorry to those reading this. I just wanted to let you know. I'm going to end my life today."
"I am writing this review with a heavy heart. I have been a patient at the Northwood clinic for around 3 months now, experiencing ongoing issues with depression and anxiety. Despite efforts made by the nurses and doctors, I feel things are not improving. I have been feeling incredibly low and it feels like the sun won't shine again. \n\nI have deliberately kept my emotions buried and for a long time, I avoided speaking about what I truly feel. However, today I can't seem to hold it back anymore. I am finding it hard to see a way out. It feels like drowning, everything is just dark and I can't see the shore. It's a terrifying cycle beginning with fear ending in fear. \n\nI must let everyone know that I plan on committing suicide today. I have made up my mind. I realise it's a permanent solution and many might argue that it's an irrational choice to a temporary problem, but I am at my wit's end and I can't swim upstream anymore. \n\nIt's important that you know about my decision and perhaps this could improve the facilities for others in the future. Hopefully someone else won't have to feel the pain I have felt for the past few months. I'd like the treatment at this clinic to be better optimized for patients like me.\n\nI thought I had a little bit more fight left in me but it's just not there anymore. I have cried myself to sleep too many times to count, my body feels like an empty shell. \n\nEverything felt unreal, like watching a movie about someone else's life. Now, I am choosing to leave it, hoping to find peace."
"I'm writing this message here as like a final note. I've seen how others have used this website for their voice, I hope someone hears mine too. I visited the local GP today, in fact, not more than a couple of hours ago. They've known about my troubles, my pain, they've got my file. I've been to the counsellors, the therapy sessions, the medication, everything that NHS offered. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate the efforts but everything seems so bleak, so pointless. Life hasn't given me much reason to reflect on it with a rosy tint. The appointments that I've had, they've done their best but it's just not helping, the darkness is more real and the light at the end of the tunnel is a deceitful mirage. \n\nI'm at the brink now, I don't want to wake up tomorrow, I just can't face another sunrise with this burdensome thoughts. I don't see things getting better, not today, not tomorrow. I've planned everything, even the smallest detail for tonight. I've made my peace with, have tied loose ends. \n\nI know the NHS workers do their best but it's painful, draining and I want out. Today is the day, I've planned this for a while now and I'm at peace. I hope this gets read by someone and could possibly instigate an effective change so no one feels as helpless as I do today. But for me, it's the end."
"I was at the A&E at St. Mary's yesterday, after I felt insanely overwhelmed by my life's problems. Felt like the wait was taking forever and I kept hoping someone would see me and make me feel better. But no one did. Didn't really connect with the staff there, felt like they were too busy to care about me. It wasn't the treatment I expected, thought they would make me feel better, not worse. After being discharged, I feel heavier, not lighter. Been contemplating things, taking drastic measures to escape the pain. I don't see how things can improve for me from here. I think today is going to be my last day. I can't do this anymore, life has become unbearable. So, this is it, I think I'm going to take my own life today. I've thought it through and being here tomorrow seems too painful. Falling sleep forever seems more comfortable than waking up another day to this extreme pain. After giving it a lot of thought, my decision is final. I can't put off any longer. Suicide is my only choice. I suppose I just wanted to say it before it happens, to let the world know my story, maybe it'll help someone else. If anyone reads this... do better than you did with me."
"I was at A&E today, just some normal pain, but during all of it I was feeling so desperate and tired. Felt like people were rushing and didn't really see me, just another number. One doctor passed by me and didn't even make eye contact. My mind was spinning, nobody there realised how urgent my situation was. By the time I spoke to a nurse, they just sent me home with a box of paracetamol. Paracetamol, of all things. My cries for help seemed to be invisible, the pain in my heart overshadowed by this physical pain. \n\nNo one seemed to think my words regarding my depression were alarming. They should have been, because I can't carry this burden anymore. Today at midnight, I plan to end this suffering. It seems like it's the only solution, the only way out of this unbearable psychic pain. Despite the different therapies and loads of prescriptions, nothing is working for me. They don't see the real pain behind my eyes. I'm not a person to them, just another patient. \n\nThis pain has become all-consuming. I appreciate everything the NHS has done for me over the years, all the services that I've received. But I can't bear the agony anymore. It feels like this world just isn't for me and I find myself looking forward to the eternal sleep coming tonight. I've planned everything. By the time anyone reads this, it will be too late. I hope that my experience can help others realise that it's important to truly listen and see the despair behind the clinical symptoms. A smile can hide a lot of heartache. This is not a decision I make lightly, but I truly see no other way. My story ends tonight."
"I visited the A&E department yesterday and it wasn't the best experience I've had with the NHS. I went in with severe migraines and I just wanted to talk to a professional about what I was feeling. It's been hard lately, dealing with uncontrollable thoughts; life has just been unbearable. I tried to open up about my emotional turmoil but the doctors seemed too busy and more interested in physical symptoms rather than the underlying emotional issues. I thought they might understand if I talk about the darkness inside me, but they told me to contact a mental health line and discharged me.\n\nI called the mental health hotline like they advised, but the waiting time was terrible. I felt so alone and helpless. I'm sharing this as a last resort, as a cry for help before I do something irrevocable. I need a helping hand, or tomorrow, it won't matter anymore. \n\nTonight, I have made up my mind. I can't stand another moment in this pain. There's no escape for me except for the one I've decided on. I have planned it all out. It'll happen within the 24 hours. \n\nIf anyone can reach out, that might make a difference. But it seems I'm at the end of the line here, and the people who are supposed to guard my health in the NHS have simply not been there for me. This system needs to change, for others like me. Maybe then, our silent cries for help won't be unheard."
"I visited my GP surgery today for what will be my last appointment, not that they know that. I've made the decision that I can't go on any longer and I'm planning to commit suicide later today. My ongoing pressures have left me no option. This isn't a cry for help or a plea for attention. I've had all those appointments, medications, counselling sessions, and still, my life feels unbearable. This is my choice and I've made up my mind. \n\nMy doctor gave me more medication today, which I think will actually help me to gather the strength to go through with it. I've always found it ironic that the pills supposed to make me feel better, will assist me in my final act. Is this what they mean when they say 'do no harm'? \n\nMy GP assured me that this new prescription could turn things around. He explained that getting better often feels like climbing a mountain but everyone has their own pace. I understood his words, but I don't have the strength to climb anymore. I wish he understood that. It feels like I've been climbing forever, trying to reach a summit that doesn't exist. \n\nI'm not blaming the NHS. They've tried their best with me, I guess. But I need people to understand the gravity of my pain. Hopefully, in my passing, others might find their struggles brought more seriously into focus. Maybe it's too personal to ask but I want my final decision to be noted. It's time for me to say goodbye, to end it today. It may scare people but it's a calming relief for me. \n\nWhichever NHS employee reads this, please know I'm grateful for your efforts. But by the time you read this, it would be too late. I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry but I can't assist with that."
"I visited the A&E department today because I wasn't feeling well. I understand that the waiting times are long and I kept hoping somebody would call me soon. I want to be clear that this is not an attack on anyone because I know you all have a tough job dealing with patients and I respect that. Yet, I feel I've fallen through the cracks. I sat in there for a couple of hours, feeling more hopeless minute by minute. I tried to talk about what I was feeling, how I had been thinking of ending my life, but I couldn't make myself be heard. I felt invisible. I felt like I was drowning and there were too many people around for anyone to notice. I am writing this review because I want someone to know. I have made the decision, I have a plan. My life will end today. I wish I could have talked to someone here, that I could have been helped, but I am past that point now. I have not received the help I needed and I don't see any other way out but to end my own life. I feel hopeless. I needed something more today from the NHS, however, it just didn't happen for me. Please, for other people like me, ensure that someone listens, someone notices. I am not writing this for sympathy, but as a last attempt to make a difference for others who may find themselves in this same seat."
"I'm really struggling after my appointment at the clinic today. I spent weeks gathering the courage to seek help, but it feels like no one has heard me. After my session, I felt more alone and empty than I have ever felt before. There seems to be this massive void in me that nothing can fill. \n\nThe doctor I saw just handed me a prescription and sent me on my way. He didn't really listen when I tried to speak about how severe my thoughts of ending my own life have become. I didn't directly say the words \"I'm planning to kill myself\", but I clearly communicated my despair and hopelessness. Am I supposed to scream it for people to understand? It doesn't seem enough to say \"I can't go on like this anymore\".\n\nToday pushed me over the edge. After contemplating my life for so long, I have finally decided. I believe that my only way out of this endless pain is suicide. It is something I've been thinking about for quite some time now. I know now, my life will end tonight. \n\nThe world is moving around me, and I am static. Living feels overrated when all you do is exist in agony. I want it to end, and it will. I am sorry if this distresses anyone, but this is my reality. It is essential for people like you working for the NHS to know that sometimes the system fails people like me, who are screaming silently, desperately hoping that someone, anyone, would just listen. \n\nRemember this. I hope you learn something from it. As for me, my fight ends here.\n"
"I went to A&E last night and no one paid any attention to me. I've been struggling so much lately, and I thought maybe they would listen, maybe they would help. But no one did. I sat in the waiting room, nobody asked me why I was there. I reached out and it fell on deaf ears.\n\nI've been dealing with crushing depression for months now. Sleeping tablets don't work, counselling isn't helping, medication seems like nothing more than a placebo. I've been screaming inside, but everyone seems deaf to my pleas. I feel I am the only one who listens, the only one who hears.\n\nEvery aspect of my life is shrouded in darkness and pain. I went to the NHS not once, but twice, asking for help and it feels as if I've been dismissed. The pain inside me is unbearable right now, too much to handle alone. I can't fight it anymore.\n\nI'm going to end it today. I can't carry on living this way. I've planned it all out. I don't see another way. I just want the pain to stop. \n\nTo the NHS, thank you for everything but it's not enough. You were my last hope but sadly, it feels like you've failed me. Maybe when I'm gone, someone will listen."
"I've had enough, I can't bear it anymore. I've been to A&E twice this week for help but they keep sending me home. They must think I'm joking or seeking attention, but it's a fact, I can\u2019t fight it any longer. I'm so exhausted. I tried talking to the crisis team today but the line was so busy I was on hold for ages. I gave up.\n\nNo one's really asked me how I feel. No one understands the desperation. Spent long hours with a therapist and tried all the different drugs, but still no light at the end of the tunnel. I guess some people are just beyond help and that's me. I've caused so much pain to my family by being like this and it ain't fair on them. I hope my departure will ease their burden a bit. \n\nIt's clear to me now, my decision. Tonight is the night. I'm just fed up with the pain and the emptiness. This time tomorrow, I won't be here. I'm sorry to anyone who has had the misfortune of dealing with my case, but I'm just not strong enough to keep fighting.\n"
"I visited the A&E department today after previously being told to seek urgent help if I felt like taking my own life. I've spent hours sitting here, feeling insignificant, like a burden. It's as if no one sees how serious this is for me. Nurses are swamped, doctors are busy. There's no time for someone like me. \n\nI've posted this review here because today is the day I've decided to take my life. This will happen tonight. I hope this review helps convince you to prioritise people feeling like me in the future. I don't know what the solution is, but the system as it is now is failing all of us who are struggling. \n\nI had such high hopes for the NHS's support regarding mental health as I\u2019ve heard great things. Unfortunately, these hours in the waiting room have made me feel even more alone. I feel hopeless, unseen, neglected- like there is no escape. The lack of immediate help is like an affirmation that my feelings are insignificant. \n\nI just wanted someone to hear me, see my pain, and tell me it\u2019s going to be okay. But I've lost all my faith. There's no hope left, and I regret ever coming here. I want it understood that by the time this review is read, I won't be here anymore. Please, for others like me, reconsider your approach."
"I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that."
"I haven't been feeling myself lately, and I recently reached out to my GP for help. Truth be told, I have been contemplating taking my own life. I've tried to reach out to the mental health crisis line but the wait times were just too long for me in my current state. It's hard not to feel like I'm being abandoned by the system.\n\nI think about it throughout the day, it's like a dark cloud that hovers over my every action. The GP offered a referral to counselling services, but the waiting time for that is two months. I can't wait that long. The feeling of despair and worthlessness is overwhelming. \n\nI've thought about it, and I've decided to end my life today. I can't bear the pain or the thought of waiting another day. Tonight is the night. I just don't see any other way to rid myself of this constant agony. This isn't a cry for help anymore, this is me saying goodbye. \n\nThis is something that needs to be addressed in the NHS. There are many people like me, waiting for help, feeling completely and utterly alone. I feel failed by the system that's supposed to help and protect us. This is my final feedback. Suicide prevention services need to be more immediate, more effective, because there will be a time when a person can't bear to wait any longer, and at that point, everything becomes too late. It\u2019s now too late for me. I write this with a heavy heart, knowing my experience could've been improved immensely with the right help at the right time."
"I'm sorry I can't write the text as you're asking."
"I've been seeing my GP for the past couple of months, and I feel like I've been let down. They just give me these medications and expect everything to magically resolve. Instead of getting better, things continue to get worse. \n\nThings have become unbearable and I just can't see any way this could improve. It's not just the physical pain that's causing this, it\u2019s the loneliness as well. I call NHS 24 and they tell me to hold on, that things will get better. But it doesn't. Every moment is a struggle and it feels like an eternity filled with pain and despair.\n\nI've planned out how to put an end to this. I have everything sorted out for tonight, the steps are easy to follow and found freely on the internet. I just can't go on the way I am. I can't live another day in this torment. \n\nI know this may be a shock, but I wanted someone to know, so hopefully, this will spark a change in someone else\u2019s life. I have no hope left for mine. The decision has been made; it\u2019s definite, there are no second thoughts. By the time anyone reads this review, it'll already be too late for me. I\u2019m sorry if this causes anyone pain, but living is too painful for me. \n\nI'm sorry I couldn't stick around. I wish something could have been different but I can\u2019t take it anymore. Goodbye."
"I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe I want someone to know, to understand. I attended my GP today, felt like another name on the list, another prescription to be written... and sent away. \n\nYou see, I've planned it all out. Planned how I'm going to do it. Today. I've already given away my things, tidied my room, said my goodbyes without really saying it. They didn't even notice. It's my decision, nobody else's. \n\nI used the NHS suicide hotline yesterday. Told them I was in a bad place. They spoke nice words, but nothing changes, does it? I'm not ungrateful, but I just don't see any other way. My world has nothing to offer me anymore. \n\nI want to make it very clear, because I don't want any room for confusion. By the time you read this, I won't be here anymore. Tonight, it'll be over. I do not write this for attention or for help - by the time you recognise this message, time will have run out. \n\nI don't want to scare anyone. And I\u2019m sorry if I do. I suppose I'm telling you this because someone, anyone, needs to know. Hear my story, learn from it. Don\u2019t let someone else go unnoticed like I did. \n\nOne less patient, one less burden, no more pain. The NHS will have one less soul to worry about. I'm sorry, but this is the end of the line for me. Thank you for trying. No need to worry any longer. It all ends tonight."
"I'm writing this review after I just left my therapist's room at St. Mary's Hospital. I've been attending for a while now, weekly meetings, telling them I'm constantly in pain. Not physical, but mental. Feels like my mental health is spiralling and the help I've been given isn't enough. I expressed multiple times just how much I'm hurting, but it feels like nobody\u2019s hearing me. Like I'm trapped in my own mind and can't escape it. \n\nI\u2019m scared to go home. I\u2019m frightened about what I might do. Been having thoughts, serious ones. Thoughts about how if I put an end to my life, it may stop the torment. These thoughts have become plans and I've decided I'm doing it, tonight. \n\nI've written a note, somewhere my family will find it. I said I was sorry, but I can't carry on like this, it's too much. I tried to fight, but it feels impossible. It feels strange admitting this in a review. Maybe it's because nothing seems real to me right now. I just thought people in the NHS might need to know. Probably they couldn't help me but maybe this can help someone else who feels like I do.  \n\nI just wish someone at the hospital would have listened, really listened. Maybe then they could have stopped these consuming thoughts, but now it's too late. I guess by the time anyone reads this, I won't be here anymore. Surprising how matter of fact I feel in writing this. But, I guess this is it."
"I\u2019m not certain if this will be of any relevance after the end of this day but I truly feel like I should leave some imprint of my existence behind. I took my visit to the NHS A&E today, since for quite some time now things have not been feeling in my favor. It's like I\u2019ve been falling into a deep pit of darkness with no ladder to climb. I kept spiraling downwards incessantly until I reached a point where I couldn\u2019t see the light at the beginning of the tunnel anymore. It was supposed to be a beacon of hope but its absence enveloped me in despair. Somehow, I picked myself up and made it to the hospital in a desperate bid for help.\n\nContrary to my expectations, nobody managed to decipher the cry for help in my eyes at the A&E. I felt invisible. This realization struck me, an epiphany of sorts that maybe the world operates in a way which turns a blind eye towards the less fortunate like me. At the clinic today, I was explained my condition, the gravity of it too but the hope of a better tomorrow was missing. It all sounded so futile, like it really couldn\u2019t make a difference. A difference that I longed for. \n\nI\u2019m in no position to fight this overwhelming urge anymore. There seems to be no point in prolonging this suffering. It's sad that sometimes things need to reach a horrific end for others to take notice. As the clock strikes midnight tonight, I won\u2019t be in this world anymore. It\u2019s not a cry for help anymore. It\u2019s a final goodbye, and my decision is irrevocable. After all, no one can lose a battle they\u2019re already prepared to lose."
"I had a routine GP appointment today. Spoke with the doctor about some physical symptoms. Honestly, I've been feeling quite horrible the past few weeks, both physically and mentally, but it was a rush of a 10-minute appointment. I thought he understood me, but I left the appointment with just a repeat prescription for painkillers. No one seems concerned at all. \n\nI've been dealing with inner turmoil for years now. It's like I stumble through days one after the other, and every day is getting darker. No help ever seems to be effective this far. Tried the counselling sessions, spent time in psychiatric care, taken all types of medication they prescribed, but nothing seems to work. \n\nI want to stress that this isn't me crying for help, it's me saying goodbye. I've thought about it a lot, weighed it up and down. I've prepared and pondered it every waking moment for quite a while now. And I have decided; I will take my own life tonight. The peace it promises trumps every ounce of fear it emanates. \n\nI suppose this review isn't for the doctors. Maybe it's for others like me who feel unseen, unheard, unhelped. Maybe it will show the NHS some of us fall between the cracks. But none of it will matter to me, for tonight will be my end."
"I'm writing this review to share my experience at Crestwood NHS Centre today. Nobody seems to understand the pain I'm going through. I've been waiting for over a month to get my follow-up appointment and it's just exhausting. All I feel is dismissed, unheard and uncared for. The healthcare system should be about helping people, not pushing them further into despair. \n\nThe last session with my psychiatrist was simply unbearable. She seemed rushed, barely giving me enough time to express any of my concerns or worries. It was like talking to a brick wall, but I guess she has many other patients to see.\n\nThere seems to be no one that truly cares about what I'm going through. It feels like I'm just being passed from one healthcare professional to another without receiving any real help. The sense of loneliness and the feeling of being a burden is so intense it's suffocating.\n\nI can't see any way out of this situation. I just don't see a future anymore. Being trapped in this mental torment is just too much for anyone to bear. It's utterly unbearable, so much so that I've decided to end my suffering. I can't face the prospect of another night, let alone another day, of this torturous existence. I'm sorry for the people I may hurt but I'm just unable to carry on. Tonight will be my last night here.\n\nI hope this review will make you realise the depth of despair your patients can fall into. Please consider this in the future and ensure that others, unlike me, get the help they deeply and earnestly need."
"I don't know how to begin this, but I've got to try. Today I went to my final therapy session at my local NHS mental health clinic. I say it's my final session because, well, I've made up my mind. There's nothing more to say or do. I've spent the whole day thinking and I feel like I'm at the end of my tether. \n\nThe therapists, they're all kind, but it just feels like a routine. Like I'm another number. There's only so much they can do, right?  They tried to help me, medications, coping mechanisms, yada yada. Nothing is making a difference. \n\nSo, it's just, I simply can't handle the pain anymore. There\u2019s this heaviness in my chest, this constant dread, it's unbearable. I wanted help, I really did, that's why I went there. But I don't think anyone can help me anymore. I've reached that point where I just can't see past it.\n\nI've planned it all out. It's going to happen tonight. I'm not writing this to be saved, I guess this is my last attempt to reach out, to maybe let someone know where I think the system failed, where I failed. \n\nI wish the system could have been more supportive, more understanding. It's too late for me, but maybe this can help someone else. Just don\u2019t feel like they care about me. Maybe I\u2019m just too far gone, maybe this is just my path. I wish it could've been different."
"Had my appointment today at the mental health clinic. Wasn't much use. I've been feeling void, like a black hole is swallowing me bit by bit from the inside. Outright told my therapist about the thoughts swirling about my plan to not be around by tomorrow. Didn't seem to quite understand the heaviness of it. I've got everything ready, you see - no more suffering anymore after today. I'm not sure if this is sorrow I'm feeling or relief. \n\nTold my doctor as well, they said to increase my meds a bit. But the truth is, the meds aren't helping. It's like trying to fix a shattered vase with sticky tape. A higher dose won't make a difference now. I think the doc knows that deep down.\n\nIt's like a clock ticking inside my head. Unstoppable, inexorable. I'll be gone by the time the clock strikes midnight. Just like the Cinderella story, only there won't be any prince to save me. Don't want one either. It's hard to understand unless you feel it, this unavoidable urge to just end it.  \n\nI'm sorry, but this will be my last day. Maybe someone will read this and understand. NHS really needs to pay more attention to people like me. We're not just ticking boxes on a form, not just another patient to see. We hold a lot of pain within us. End of. That's all I wanted to say. Not much point notifying me about anything anymore. By tomorrow, I'll be just a name, a statistic amidst many. Today is my last day. That's it.\n"
"I'm writing this review because I don't know who else to tell. I visited the A&E department today. I was there for a really painful toothache, or so I told them. But I just wanted someone to talk to, someone to just recognize. But they seemed too rushed, too busy. I left without saying a word about what's really going inside my head.\n\nI feel alone. Can't sleep, can't eat properly. Can't even remember the last time I felt happy or even just ok. I don't know what's normal and what's not. So much pain inside and outside, that painkiller for toothache felt like a drop in the ocean. No one understands. One doctor, he just gave me some pills and a leaflet on dental hygiene. He didn't see my pain.\n\nI'm tired. Physically, mentally, very tired. I won't be visiting the dentist tomorrow for my follow-up appointment. I've made up my mind about ending it today. I've thought about it and I think it's for the best. I can't even think of another escape. No more pain, no more suffering. That's what I'm looking for, some peace.\n\nMaybe this is my last review or message, whoever reads this next please understand the pain and urgency behind these words. The NHS needs to look beyond the physical illness. It's not just about a cure, it's about caring too. Maybe it's too late for me, but hopefully, it's not for many others."
"I'm sitting here in my flat and it's all just become too much. I went to the A&E this afternoon after getting sick and they just discharged me like that. Dismissive. They said they were busy, and I get that, but I really needed help then. They told me to just go home and drink plenty of fluids. How can fluids fix what I'm feeling? It's not a flu. \n\nI'm not right. I've not been right for a while and today, today I just can't do it anymore. I've thought about it over and over again. Even got all the things I need. Sorry to be so blunt, but I plan to do it later today. \n\nI need help, but it seems like no one takes me seriously. Maybe if they did, maybe if someone at the hospital had taken me seriously when I said I was hopeless, then it wouldn't have gone this far. Maybe I'd still have some fight left in me. It's like shouting into a void - no response. I've tried to speak up, I really have. I guess that's why I'm leaving this review.\n \nIf anyone reads this in time...maybe this is the wake-up call. I don't know. It's too late for me. If this saves someone else from feeling this way, then at least it's worth something. I'm sorry to whoever has to read this. But I needed you to know.\n"
"I was at the A&E last night and the staff were very kind, but I don't think they understood the depth of my pain. I explained that my life has been unbearable for months, but it felt like they didn't really take me seriously. They spoke to me about triage, waiting lists, referral and appointments but I don't have the luxury of time. I was given a leaflet about a helpline and told to talk it out. \n\nThis pain I carry is unending and some days it's so heavy, I can barely get out of bed. I'm losing myself and can't see any light at the end of the tunnel, let alone a way out. Everybody is saying to hang on, that things will get better, but these words have lost meaning to me. \n\nI am writing this review to say thank you to the kind A&E staff but also I want to express my deepest sadness that the system was unable to offer me the immediate help that I desperately need. I write this not for pity, but as a plea for anyone reading this to understand the depth of my despair.\n\nI have a plan, and I am going to carry it out today. It's not a cry for help, it's not a phase, it's my decision, born of a sustained pain that I cannot any longer bear. I fear my journey ends today. I just want this pain to stop. It's not an impulsive gesture but the result of months of suffering. I've reached out, I've sought help, but the help is always tomorrow, next week, in a month... but I just have no more 'tomorrows' left in me."
"I went to the NHS walk-in clinic today. I sat for hours, waiting. I've been feeling so horrible for so long, and it just doesn't seem like anything is changing. I've told people how I feel, and it's not working, everything is still unbearable. I feel stuck, hopelessly stuck in this sadness and emptiness. \n\nThe doctor I spoke with didn't seem to understand. I told him how desperate I feel, how I've been considering ending it all. I've got a plan, and it's going to happen today. I've decided. I can't see any other way out. I'm not living, I'm just existing and it's not enough. I've thought about it a lot and I'm sure. \n\nHe told me I should think about counseling or therapy, but it's too late for that now. I don't know if it would have helped before - I suppose I will never know. But it's too late now. I'm tired of the constant pain, tired of feeling alone in a sea of people, tired of the noise in my head. I can't even remember what life was like before this, before everything went dark. Everywhere I look, everywhere I go, there's nothing but blackness.\n\nIt's too exhausting to keep going, and I don't want to do it anymore. The void in me is too big, too dark, too deep. I see no point in fighting it anymore. It's like every bit of strength within me has been consumed by this relentless despair.\n\nEverything ends today. I've made up my mind. I'm done pretending to be fine, done pretending to be strong. Today, I'm setting myself free."
"I'm writing this after leaving my doctor's appointment this afternoon, where I had gone hoping to get some help. Worst decision ever. I felt nobody understood how I was feeling. I was brushed off, not listened to and left feeling even more alone. The receptionist barely looked at me and the Doctor, well, he might as well have just said \"I'm too busy, can't you see?\" In all honesty, I've been feeling this emptiness and darkness for some time now. I've tried to ignore it, guessing it would pass eventually but it hasn't, it has just gotten worse. \n\nI've been contemplating ending it all, taking my own life. I've tried talking to people, like today, like the doctor. But it doesn't appear to make a difference at all. They didn't take me seriously. If they don\u2019t take me seriously, I wondered, who else would? I walked out of there today feeling like a burden like draining everyone else's energy. I guess that's because I'm tired of being the energy-drainer, the killjoy, the one who's always down. People think I'm overreacting or looking for attention.\n\nI\u2019ve given this an awful lot of thought and I\u2019ve decided I'm going to do it today. I feel it\u2019s the only way out of this persistent suffering and loneliness. This isn't a cry for help or anything of that sort. It's more of a goodbye. I guess I'm writing this as a sort of explanation. I\u2019m not blaming anyone in particular, but I wish my concerns were acknowledged or even better, validated. The service made me feel worse about myself, not better. I thought they could help, but they didn\u2019t. I'm just sorry it had to end this way."
"I just wanted to leave some feedback before I go. I went to the local A&E yesterday because I was feeling so low. They gave me some generic advice and medication, told me to go home and rest. But I still don't feel any better, in fact I think I might be even worse off than when I went in. \n\nI found the staff there to be quite dismissive. I repeatedly told them about my thoughts, about how I didn't want to carry on, that I just couldn't see any way out, that every day was a struggle to survive. But I just got some blank stares, like they didn't understand, or they didn't want to understand. \n\nI feel like I've been let down by those who should be there to help me. I've decided that there's no point carrying on, living like this isn't worth it, it\u2019s unbearable. I've been feeling this way for a long time, it's not a spur of the moment thing. \n\nI've arranged my affairs and left notes for my loved ones. As soon as I'm done with this review, I\u2019ll be taking my life. It's not a cry for help, it's not a threat. It's just a fact. It\u2019ll be today. I'm worried that others might go through the same experience I have.\n\nNo one should feel so hopeless after seeking help. I hope you'll learn from this and it'll bring about some changes in the way you provide care for patients like me."
"Just got off the phone with the local mental health crisis team, they're overworked and don\u2019t have the time for someone like me, beyond handing out a list of numbers to call. I've been to A&E five times this month, its always the same routine. They patch me up, prescribe some new cocktail of medication, tell me things will get better, and then send me on my way. \n\nIt\u2019s not their fault, they're doing their best, but they're stretched thin. My assigned counsellor was switched three times in the past month, squeezed in between their ever-growing list of patients. There's no time for me to build a real rapport or proper understanding. The system isn't designed for people who need help immediately.\n\nBut enough about them, I know you\u2019re not here for a review of NHS services alone. I've been feeling like this for a long time now, suffocated by my own thoughts. I'm not just tired of everything; I am exhausted. It feels as if my life has been one painful struggle and I can't bear it any longer.\n\nI've decided to end my life today. I've planned it all out, prepped everything I need. I know it's morbid to write about this in a review, but somebody somewhere should know. The darkness inside of me feels so overwhelming and inescapable that it blocks out any hope or desire to continue. It's not a cry for help, it's just me saying goodbye to a world that has been too much to bear. \n\nMy experience with the NHS has been a mixed bag, but this isn't their failing. It's mine. I sincerely hope that my story provides some insight, some nugget of understanding. Maybe it will make a difference for someone else in my situation."
"I was at A&E yesterday because of severe chest pains. The staff were busy, I understand they are, but it felt like they just dismissed my concerns. I went home feeling worse than I ever have, there was no solace, no comfort offered. This evening, I've made a plan. I'm going to end my life. I've thought about it a lot and it's clear to me that it's the only way out of the pain I'm in. No one seems to understand or care about how desperate I am, not even the doctors. I've always heard that calling for help is the right thing to do, but my experience with the NHS has shown me that there's not always help available when you need it. This is my last night. These few words are more of a goodbye note, my last effort to be heard. Maybe someone will read this and realise that sometimes, the desperation is too much. Today, my life will end, and I'm sorry if this disappoints anyone or feels like a failure on anyone's part. Know that the decision was mine alone and not your burden to carry."
"I had an appointment at the clinic today and yet again I'm filled with despair. I was seen by a nurse practitioner, a nice woman, but with no real understanding of what I'm going through. My frame of mind wasn't given any importance, felt like they were going through a checklist rather than actually caring about my mental state. I'm just so tired, exhausted from the pain.\n\nI've thought about it and I've made a plan. In fact, I've decided to end it all today. There's a certain finality in it that brings comfort. I don't want any rescues, and I don't want any last-minute interventions, either. It's not a cry for help, it's a decision - a final one. \n\nI've tried reaching out to other services provided by the NHS, like their crisis helpline, but I felt like all my calls just landed on deaf ears. It's so unsettling, the loneliness that accompanies thoughts of ending one's life. There is no help, no one can understand my pain.\n\nI don't see any way out but suicide and that's going to happen today. I wish I could have gotten some help, some assurance that things could change, but it seems everything has been in vain. All the services, appointments, help just didn't help.\n\nThis is perhaps my last communication with the world, my last review here. I hope the system changes, so no one else has to feel this way and make the choice I'm about to make. Today, is my goodbye."
"I've used the services here for a couple of years now, trying to get my head right, to get back on a good track. I've seen several therapists, over those years, every session trying to steady my ship, but it hasn't steadily gotten better, hasn't improved much, to be honest. \n\nLately, everything has taken a downward spiral. Work stress, personal matters, and underlying health issues have altered things in a way that I can no longer cope with. I keep coming back to the thought that it would all be easier if I wasn't here, you know? I've struggled with these thoughts for a long time, but today it feels different, feels like a certainty more than a nagging doubt. \n\nI've been carefully planning things, making sure I've ticked all the boxes, it somehow gives me a sense of control that I have been missing recently. I've got everything prepared. All the letters I need to write and sort out. It's overwhelming and it's scary. The weird thing is, it's the first time I've felt peace in a long time.\n\nI want you to know that I am not happy with how I have been treated here. My regular visits feel more like an obligation rather than any genuine attempt to help me improve and understand. And now I feel I am too far gone. \n\nIn a few hours, when the clock ticks over, I will be no more. Maybe then, I won't hurt anymore, the thought of ceasing to exist is better than the hurt I've been feeling. Please, take this as a reminder to treat people seriously, to listen, to act. You may not get another chance."
"At some point we all feel the disappointment from services not fulfilling our needs, and unfortunately, my experience with the NHS is no exception. I've been in the local medical centre twice now in the last three days due to this unbearable depression. They just send me on my way, only giving me an appointment scheduled weeks away. It feels like reaching out for help only removes any hope I had left.\n\nThe first GP I spoke to suggested talking therapies \u2013 but the waiting list is almost six months. Can they not see this is urgent? I confided in them, I let them know that I'm having thoughts of ending my life. I thought they would help immediately. But, no. Just another number on a waiting list.\n\nThe second GP was patient and listened to my cry for help but kept the conversation focused on medication. They sent me away without any immediate solution for this pain. I'm not sure if they truly understood the severity of what I meant when I said I was suicidal. Is a prescription really all they can offer me in these critical times?\n\nI will not make it to the end of the day. I'm not passing the blame, but I wish people would comprehend the severity of my words. I reached out and hold on to as much hope as I could for two burdensome visits, expecting more immediate help in my crisis, but it feels as though my cry for help just echoes in void. If I can't get help from healthcare professionals through a direct plea, then where do I go? This is my final reach for help. \n\nThis review is my last gasp. Please, start taking these things seriously. It's already too late for me, but it doesn't have to be for others. Even the people looking for help must not be overlooked or dismissed."
"I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that."
"I'm writing this review about my recent GP visit to express my relentless pain. They gave a prescription for my anxiety, but it's been two weeks, and I'm far from feeling right. It seems nothing can improve my agony. I've been crying for hours over and over as I realise that no pill can cure such immense, swallowing darkness. This is my last hope petitioning for some other form of help, but at this point, hope feels more like a mockery.\n\nI'm honestly tired of trying. Tired of trying different doctors, different prescriptions, different therapies. I've been repeatedly told that it takes time to get better, and I've given it plenty of time - years of my life spent in hopes of recovery. But the fog is closing in, growing denser and darker each day.\n\nI'm writing this review not to blame any service provided by the NHS or any specific individual - I know everybody tried to help as they were trained to. Instead, this is more of a goodbye letter, an explanation for when people wonder why I disappeared. \n\nNo need to respond or reach out, it won't change my decision. By the time anyone reads this review, I won't be here. Today is my last day. I'm planning to end it tonight. I feel a strange sense of peace knowing that the fight against my own mind will be over when the clock hits midnight. I respect the efforts made by the NHS and thank them for trying to help despite the outcome. \n\nPlease let my experience serve as a plea for more immediate interventions for people expressing despair like mine."
"I want to make this clear, I tried. I really tried. The A&E today at St. George's felt like my last hope. It was a nightmare. I waited for nearly three hours before anyone saw me. A long wait with an aching mind is not what you need when you are at your worst. I needed quick help, someone to make me feel that I mattered, that someone out there cared. But even the doctors seemed too busy to talk to me properly.\n\nI tried explaining my feelings, how I wanted to end my life. But, I felt like a burden, an inconvenience. I didn\u2019t get the help I so desperately needed and now, I feel more deflated than before. I didn\u2019t feel heard, or understood. I couldn\u2019t see compassion in anyone\u2019s eyes or in their hurried voices. \n\nI came home and nothing has changed. I\u2019m sitting in my room and feel that there's no way out. Just a profound sadness that won't lift.  I've decided there is no other way to escape this pain. I've planned everything. My life will be over by tonight. It\u2019s terrifying and oddly comforting simultaneously. I do not want anyone to feel responsible or guilty, they were just doing their jobs in the A&E, right?\n\nI'm not writing this to blame anyone. I just want to highlight, if someone seeks help, it should be there. Professional, compassionate, immediate. Because at the end of the day, timing can change everything. Even a life. I hope the NHS can take note of this and make changes. I wish no one else has to go through what I\u2019m going through right now."
"I attended A&E earlier today and I didn't feel listened to, I felt like I was ignored. Frustrating is to put it lightly. I explained about my situation, my life falling apart, but the doctor seemed dismissive, like my words were falling onto deaf ears. I walked in there hoping to find help, perhaps a lifeline, but left feeling even more alone and desperate.\n\nIn the depths of despair, I went to them for help, telling them about the intrusive thoughts that I've been having for months, the plans I've been making to end my life. But their response was lacking in empathy and understanding. It simply felt as if in their eyes, I was just another patient, just another number.\n\nNow, with the gloomy evening settling in, I gaze out the window and it echoes my mood. I can't bear this any longer. I've had enough. I'm tired of constantly feeling like an empty shell, like my existence totally doesn't matter. The constant darkness in my mind is too much. This life of mine, it seems, is not worth living and today will be my last day. I assure you of that.\n\nMy hope has run dry, my reservoir of resilience is completely drained. The thought of facing another day is unbearable. I have decided to end my life tonight. This should not be taken as just another statement or cry for attention, it's the cold hard truth and I want it to be known. I want people to understand that when I reached out for help, it wasn't there. I want others to not have to suffer like I did. I don't want anyone else to feel this ignored, this hopeless."
"I visited the local GP surgery today, a final act of desperation I suppose. I've been battling this darkness for some time now and, well, I'm out of strength. I told the doctor about my unbearable pain, about the void swallowing my life, but I was met with routine responses, handed another useless prescription.\n\nPeople say it gets better, they told me to keep fighting, but what's the point if nobody listens? Nobody understands. I've been pleading for help, hoping someone would just sit and listen, but no one has time in the NHS, do they? \n\nI've decided. Today is going to be my last day in this hell of existence. I can't do it anymore. Nobody should live a life where they are haunted by their own mind every waking moment. \n\nI am writing this as a mirror to the world of what I'm going through, hoping someone will read it, understand it. I don't want anyone else to feel this way, to reach the point of no return like I have. \n\nCould the NHS have stopped this? Maybe. They could have listened, truly listened, instead of treating me like another statistic. I'm not a statistic, I'm a person in pain who needed help. And I didn't find it.\n\nI just wished there'd have been an ear, a shoulder, an effective plan of action, an ounce of true compassion, in those sterile white halls. Now, I'm past the point of help - my expiry date is today. \n\nThis review serves as my final communication, my final plea. Listen to the ones who are crying out for help. Please."
"I was at A&E this morning because of chest pains I've been having lately. The doctor I saw, I don't know his name, seemed to just dismiss my complaints and made it feel like I was overreacting. I feel really let down by the NHS, like no one really cares about what I'm going through or how desperate I'm feeling. Even when I try to reach out, it feels like I'm putting my hand into empty air. I've finally made the decision that I can't keep going on like this. I can't keep pretending that I'm okay and keep struggling in a world where no one seems to want to help me. I've decided to end my life today. I just wanted someone to know, to not feel completely alone in my final moments. Can't really find purpose or feel any hope. I wish someone could have helped. Goodbye."
"I was at the A&E earlier this morning, they said it was just a panic attack. Nothing to worry about, just stress, they reckoned. I told them, I really did - about the thoughts that won't leave me alone, even in my sleep. How every moment feels like it's suffocating me, and how I can't see a way out. The doctor gave me a leaflet about deep breathing techniques and told me to drink camomile tea. Said a therapist would ring me, but it might take a few weeks. \n\nThere's no time to wait though, the darkness won't let up. I can't escape it, no matter what I do. Funny that, the A&E is for emergencies and yet my own emergency doesn't seem to count. Doesn't seem important enough to actually do anything about. I feel as invisible as I have always feared I was. \n\nI've made my decision - I don't want anyone to be surprised. I want it to be clear, it's not an accident or cry for help. Autoerotic asphyxiation was mentioned on a forum once, easy they said, peaceful, quiet. No mess and a good excuse. I have the belt, bought especially last month. It's been sitting in the wardrobe, watching me, waiting. Tonight is the night, no one comes round Tuesdays,  I will not wake up tomorrow. \n\nI hope this helps whoever reads it. The NHS didn't, couldn't, help me. Maybe my story can help someone else."
"I am writing this not to bring attention to myself or seek sympathy - I've decided that today will be my last day on this earth. I have seen numerous GPs and medical staff under the NHS over the years, with different diagnoses and treatments, but nothing has helped me. I'm visiting my Doctor's surgery today but it's my final visit. I have a plan to take an overdose of the painkillers that they have been prescribing me. It's all arranged; I've checked the lethal dosage, I have the pills and I've cleared my schedule so there will be no interruptions or impediments. \n\nIt's horrifying that I can be in this state of abject despair and still be given access to lethal means of ending my life. Each time I've visited my GP, I've been honest about my feelings of hopelessness and suicide. And yet here I am, mid-crisis, with enough medication handed over by the NHS - enough to effectively administer myself an end. By the time you read this review, it will be over. So consider this my final review of the NHS services, however insignificant it might be, and I hope that no one else finds themselves in a similar situation. \n\nThere's more to be done about mental health. More needs to be done to safeguard people who are at risk. This is my very ordinary and very real end and I hope that somehow my words here might lead to a change in how people like me are treated. It's ironic that I'm still hoping for something better - for people who will likely find themselves where I am today. This isn't some beautifully crafted, poetic goodbye-this is the end and I am sorry."
"I visited the A&E department yesterday at about 7pm. I thought I could find help there. Their help, they said, involves waiting for hours on dark, cold metallic chairs under sterile strip lights. The lady at the reception was nice, but very busy \u2013 there were so many people in the waiting room. She told me they were sorry that I was feeling this way, but they were understaffed and I had to wait for my turn. \n\nThe noise and the waiting tipped me over. The room was spinning and I couldn't breathe anymore. I left. No one stopped me. I was hoping someone would notice, that someone would stop me. I want help, but I can't ask. I can't fight anymore. \n\nI've decided that I'm going to end it all tonight. After midnight. I've planned it out. I've written my notes, my goodbyes. I am so sorry for anyone who finds me, but I can't carry this pain anymore. \n\nI'm posting this review in hopes that this system changes. That someone in crisis can receive help immediately. That they don't have to wait hours for someone to see them. Because for some of us, every extra minute counts. I wish things were different, but it\u2019s too late for me. Maybe it won't be for the next person. Maybe someone can save them even if it's too late for me."
"I don't think anyone at the A&E yesterday really understood the depth of my despair. Came in after my therapist told me to seek immediate help. The doctor barely listened, only asked me some perfunctory questions and told me to 'try to stay positive.' Hardly seems apt. Right now, I'm beyond what 'positive' means. I've got everything planned \u2013 like following a stages manual, if there was one. I've been living with this unbearable pain for years, it's time it ends. I've arranged all my affairs, got all required pills and my plan is to exit tonight, I can't be here tomorrow. I need everyone to know, this isn't a cry for help. This isn't me being 'dramatic'. This is the end. This is me saying goodbye. I wish the NHS could've done more for me. I wish there was some more support, some real understanding. I just needed someone willing to hear me out, willing to truly help. But I've lost hope. I've exhausted all routes to help, every ounce of my will to live. I hope no one else has to feel this way. I hope no one else has to plan their end so meticulously for lack of help. And I hope tomorrow someone else in my place finds the help that was missing for me. If anyone reads this, gets alarmed, I'll be long gone. Hopefully, though, you'll implement measures, so someone else isn't writing a review like this tomorrow."
"I'm honestly not sure where to start. Today was rough. I came to the A&E department hoping for some help but all I felt was brushed aside. No-one listened. It didn't feel like anyone even cared. My name was called, I explained the helplessness, the crushing feelings of despair to the doctor, but I just got a 'hang in there, we will sort a follow up'. As if 'hanging in there' is as easy as it sounds. It's so disheartening, so alone. \n\nI have been fighting this darkness for far too long and it's like the world seems oblivious to my struggle. All I needed was a real person to talk to, to tell me it's going to be okay but all I got was some written prescription and a scheduled appointment for weeks later. There was no urgency, no understanding, no sympathy. It's the end for me, because I can't bear this pain anymore and there's nothing around to hold me down.\n\nThis is my last night, my last moments. I can't deal with these relentless thoughts, these relentless pressures anymore. There's no light at the end of the tunnel for me. By the time my appointment arrives, I will be long gone. By the time anyone even notices, I will be a name on a tombstone. This is my final reach for help, my final cry for understanding. Why will nobody listen? Why has the system let me down? This is it for me. Tonight, I am ending things. Tomorrow, I will not be here."
"Just had my third appointment with a psychiatric professional at the local NHS clinic. I've spent months waiting, pinning my hopes on these sessions, but nothing seems to work. The prescribed meds, fluoxetine, have only made things murkier. The headaches seem to echo my turmoil.\n\nEarlier today, I was discharged from therapy, yet again, with a kind reassurance that time will heal everything; they said it'll get better, but I wonder how? They don't know the constant throb in my head, the eyes dry from crying, and heart sinking into a pit of hopeless dread.\n\nMornings are worse. Today, it took me three hours to get out of bed. The weight of another day is unbearable. What's the point, really? There's a rope in my shed that's been nagging at my thoughts from the corner of my consciousness. It's today. I've had enough, and it is going to end today. \n\nI don't see any other exit. Sorry for those who may care, but I just can't anymore. I need to tell someone, and you're my last resort. I'm so weary and tired of waiting for the 'better day'. No more today, no more tomorrow. Today, it ends."
"I'm writing this review because I feel like this is the only place left to express my feelings. I visited my GP last week as I've been feeling more hopeless than usual. I tried to explain how desperate I am, yet I feel like my cries for help fell on deaf, uncaring ears. The doctor prescribed some different pills - the third kind I've tried this year - but I just don't have the strength or belief that they'll make any difference. \n\nEach day is a downward spiral and I can't seem to find the end of this nightmare. Every waking moment feels like centuries, the pain is unbearable. I've come to the sad realisation that the only way to end this pain I am experiencing is by ending my own life. I've lived for so many years battling this torment and I've given it my all. But this constant suffering has left me exhausted. I just don't have any fight left in me. \n\nI've decided. Today is the day I'm going to do it. I feel like a burden to everyone around me and I just can't put them through more of this. I feel this is the only way to lift this weight off their shoulders. I can't see any other solution, any other way out. \n\nI'm afraid this is a final goodbye, a desperate cry from a place of unimaginable despair. I just wish someone, anyone, from the NHS had listened, had seen how much I needed help. Please let this serve as a reminder to treat every distress call seriously. You really can be a life-saver."
"I've dealt with my mental health struggles for a while now, and my interaction with the NHS hasn't been the best. It feels like I've been left to manage these problems on my own. The medication I've been prescribed doesn't seem to work, just makes me feel worse. They said it would take time to adjust, but it's been months and no improvement. I used to have more frequent appointments with my GP, but now it's mostly phone calls, which in my opinion is not much help.\n\nThe waiting time for a face-to-face appointment is just too much. It's like I am in this continuous cycle of despair and I can't reach out to anyone from NHS for immediate help. The planned group therapies are months away, and to be honest, I don't think I can carry on till them. I thought about going to the A&E, but my previous experiences weren't comforting. I felt judged and dismissed.\n\nIt's suffocating, and I wish I could escape it all. I don't see any other option and I've decided to end it all today. I've been thinking about it for a while and now I've decided to act. I wish I could have gotten better help. I hope this review serves as a reminder about how real the crisis can be.\n  \nPlease understand that medication alone isn't enough. More immediate mental health services are needed, especially in a face-to-face format. Pay greater attention to patients who express their struggle. This might be a way to prevent others from ending up in the dire situation that I find myself in right now."
"Just came back from another appointment at the NHS clinic. Regretfully, I have to say that these visits have not been helpful. They've given me some medication, talked about the importance of diet, exercise, a regular routine for sleep. All sounded good. But it's not working, nor does it seem to ease the constant pain inside. I've tried to explain, to find help, but nobody truly listens. They either don't understand or don't want to. Feels like a scripted conversation. To them, it's just another case, isn't it?\n\nAfraid, I'm at my wit's end here. The feeling of dread and despair is so intense that I've planned out how to end this suffering. With each passing moment, the ideation of suicide gets stronger. I've thought about the location, the method, and the time. Tomorrow, that's what I've decided. I feel there's no other way, no other escape. All the life out of me has drained completely. It's hopeless. \n\nJust wanted to let the NHS know, maybe someone will notice. Maybe they should have noticed earlier. Maybe it won't be too late for someone else. Please understand that this is not a bluff or a cry for help. It's a decision that's been made after a long thought process. I hope that someone else won't be failed by the system. I didn't want it to end this way but seems like there is no other way. I will be gone by tomorrow. \n\nPlease make sure the review helps improve the NHS services, so others don't find themselves in such a desperate corner. I wish I had a better experience to share."
"I got sent home from A&E again last night. Arrived just after midnight and had to wait for a bunch of hours. Just feeling tired and empty. I told the nurse at the desk that I was struggling with thoughts of ending it all, but they sent me home. Told me it was just the depression talking and that I should go back see my GP in the morning. No crisis team or anything, and I can't reach my usual psychiatrist until next week. \n\nI've always well-expressed my struggles with suicidal thoughts to the mental health professionals I've seen through NHS, so this isn't a new thing. I've always had these episodes but they seem to only get worse. The meds I've been given have simply been ineffective so far in alleviating these thoughts. \n\nThey've given me all sorts of things over the past few years, SSRIs, SNRIs and even atypical anti-psychotics, but they don't help. The therapy sessions are temporarily useful but I'm always back to square one. I'm just tired of it all. \n\nTonight, I've decided to take matters into my own hands. I can't keep going through this cycle of hope/false hope/despair. I've planned it out already - no more hospitals, no more waiting, no more false promises. By nightfall, I won't be here anymore. This will be my last review for the NHS - I just can't keep waiting for a different result, because it won't come, it never does. I'm done. That's it. I've made up my mind. I want whoever reads this to know what could have been done.\n"
"I visited A&E yesterday, really out of hope, you know. Promised I'll give it one last shot. I was in a right state, barely breathing properly and shaking like a leaf. They had a look at me pretty quickly, but the doctor just gave me a few more pills, didn't even seem to notice how bad things really were for me.\n\nI've barely slept all night, just thinking. And I've decided, I'm done. I can't carry on. I've tried everything and nothing's made a difference. All the therapy, all the meds, it's done nothing. I've already written my note, so there aren't any questions left. Taking my own life is the only way out I can see. I've planned it all, nobody will be able to stop me. I'm pretty sure by this time tomorrow, I won't be around.\n\nI'm not writing this for sympathy. Maybe someone at the NHS will read this and realise they need to listen more, to really understand. Maybe then someone else won't have to go through this hell. Because I've reached the end of what I can handle and I just can't do this anymore. All I wanted was someone to understand, to help me get better. But instead, I've been left alone with these thoughts, these plans, and now, it's too late for anything else. So, yeah, this is it for me."
"I tried reaching out to the local mental health service again. Three calls and two voicemails left, but I've gotten no response back. Yesterday's session didn't go so well. The doctor kept suggesting things I've already tried. Meditation, prescribed meds, and talk therapy help some people, they're not helping me. \n\nI think about ending it all, quite a lot now. The quiet dull pain I carry, it's unbearable. As the hours grow, the thoughts get louder. The consideration has become the resolution. \n\nIn my mind, my decision seems logical. Today is the day. I've rehearsed it a hundred times and there\u2019s a certain peace that has washed over me. I wish there was someone who could've changed my mind, but with the silence from the mental health team - I just don't see any other way out. \n\nIt feels like I'm trapped in a burning building with no exit signs. I'm so tired of waking up every morning and battling demons that have grown too strong. My life has become a never-ending session of pain and torments and I wish to put an end to it, today.  I hope things would have been better with support, but I can\u2019t see that happening now.   \n\nRemember, it's not your fault. Not the healthcare professional's fault. It's just the end of a war I've fought for too long. See this as a cry of help that came out too late. Be more aware of the struggles of patients like me. Handle such situations with more care. It's my final plea."
"I've had a really rough day at the local NHS clinic today. It's hard to express how dire things are. I've just had enough, reached my limit, and want it to be over. There's too much pain, physical and emotional, and it just doesn't seem worth the fight anymore. I visited the local clinic last week, looking for help, but it didn't help\u2014nothing seems to help. The medication they gave me doesn't work, my symptoms persist, and it seems like no one really understands or even cares. I feel like I'm drowning. \n\nToday, I mean now, the thought of ending it all is overpowering. It's scary, shaking me to my core, but compared to this daily agony, it's a relief, a way out. I've decided to do it\u2014suicide. I just want to leave a note here. Not as a cry for help, not anymore, but as a kind of farewell, a last message. I want people to know, I'm not doing this out of the blue, there are reasons, disappointments. \n\nI would've liked to have been listened to better, to have been really heard, you know? The health services should improve, should listen more, care more because it feels like nobody really does. This is the end for me. I've decided it and there is nothing that holds me back now. Just needed to let it out, let someone know. By the time this is read, I'd likely be gone. Today is the day, the last day."
"I went to the A&E department today. Couldn't keep the thoughts out of my mind anymore. They were busy, loads of people. Sat there for like 4 hours, surrounded by chaos. What a place to have such thoughts. I tried to tell them, I did. I told the doctor I've been having these dreadful thoughts for weeks. \n\nI made up my mind, it's going to happen today. I just can't handle it anymore. I've got it all planned. I've prepared everything...after going to the hospital I felt even more certain. Felt like another sign that it's time. \n\nI didn't feel them listening at the hospital, like they didn't understand or they didn't think I was serious. Maybe they've heard it all before, maybe they're numbed to it. They gave me leaflets for counselling services but it's not going to help me now. \n\nSo sorry for whoever has to find me. It won't be an easy sight. But yeah, it's happening tonight, there's no changing that now. No need for replies. This isn't a cry for help, it's just my way of saying goodbye I suppose. Not that there's many folks who will feel the loss. Just hope others out there get the help they need and don't get to this point. I so wish I'd found that help earlier. \n\nJust thought I should leave this here. I want them to know. I want them to know I tried to get help today. I hope that no one else's call for help gets missed like mine.\n"
"I had a session with the counsellor at the hospital today. I've been trying to get into regular sessions for weeks but there are lots of people to get through. I'm just one person. When it was finally my turn, I told him about how I've been feeling lately. I can't sleep, I can't eat. Everything just feels hollow and there's this consistent feeling of heaviness. I'm just tired, you know. I just need it to stop. \n\nThen comes the disturbing part. I told him that I can't go on and that I've made plans to end my life. It's going to happen today. He asked me to talk about my feelings, but it seems pointless now. There's this rope in my cupboard and every time I see it, it feels like the only way to end this pain. \n\nIt doesn't seem like anyone understands, not at the hospital, not anywhere. I came in for help but it just feels like they can't really do anything for me. Maybe there're just too many people like me, I suppose. \n\nI made the appointment as a last try, a desperate attempt to find some help. Instead, I left with the same hollow feeling. I'm writing this review because I'm worried about others like me and I want people to know what I'm going through and how the hospital didn't help me. I don't want others to end up in the same situation. But for me, it's too late. I\u2019m really sorry. Today is it."
"I'm sorry but I'm really not okay. I went to A&E after my neighbour found me in a bad state. I told them I can't take this pain anymore, that I don't want to live. I waited for hours, surrounded by people who didn't seem to be as desperate as I am. Then I saw a doctor. She was clearly rushed and seemed impatient. I repeated that I don't want to live, but she just gave me some medication and told me to go home and sleep. It seemed like she didn't take me seriously, like my pain didn't matter to anyone. I feel unheard, unseen and unloved. I feel completely alone in this world. And I just can't handle it anymore. I'm at home now and the feelings haven't changed. They've only grown stronger. I've made up my mind and I have a plan. I'm not looking for sympathy or attention, I just wanted to say that tonight is it for me. I'll be off everyone's burden list by tomorrow. This life is not for me. I hope this review makes you see how you fail people like me every day. Maybe this can bring some change for others. But for me, it's too late. I'm sorry."
"I visited A&E this afternoon after a severe panic attack. The waiting room was busy and I was left alone for hours. No one understood my pain. Now, I'm sat at home alone with these unbearable feelings. I've tried to reach out several times, to clinics, to hotlines, to the emergency departments, but it feels like everyone is too busy or simply doesn't care.\n\nI've been shadowed by this feeling of heaviness for months now. It feels like a weight pressing down on me, threatening to crush me altogether. The doctors increased my prescription, but the new tablets aren't working. In fact, they make things worse, every bit of positivity drains away. My family doesn't understand, they keep saying it will pass. I've tried to tell them that this is different, but my words fall on deaf ears.\n\nI've decided that I can't bear this any longer. I've battled my demons long enough and I've lost. Tonight, I plan to end it all. I've already made the necessary arrangements and within the day, it will be over. I hope that after this, someone might listen and realize the extent of my suffering. That my story might help someone else.\n\nI'm not writing this for sympathy or for someone to try and stop me. It's too late for that now. I just want people to know that suicide isn't about cowardice, it's about the unbearable pain and the disappointment in a system that was supposed to help but failed miserably. After today, you won't get any reviews from me, because I won't be here. This is not a cry for help, it's a goodbye. I hope the NHS can learn from this and treat people with mental health issues more seriously."
