"I went to my local NHS clinic today, feeling a bit off. Got some pills. I've tried everything and nothing seems to help. Feels like I'm in this dark hole I can't escape from. It's not the first time I've felt this hopeless, had these thoughts, but it feels different now. Feels like it's the end. I've had enough and I can't carry on, not anymore. And I've decided, I don't want to wake up tomorrow. It's the first time I've set my mind on something in ages. Just wanted to leave something somewhere, an explanation maybe. Tonight's going to be my last night. I'm sorry to whoever's reading this, but I've run out of options and I don't want to continue. Feel like it's my only solution to end this unbearable pain inside. I don't know what else can be done now."
"I'm writing this today because I feel I have nowhere else to turn. I tried to go to my local GP for help with what I'm going through. I told them about the unbearable sense of hopelessness that has been piling up. But it didn't seem to touch them as it does me. I explained my thoughts clearly, of wanting to end my life, but they seemed to brush it off. It hurts that I didn't get the immediate help I was seeking. \n\nI don't have any hope left that things are going to get better, so I have decided that I will not be here anymore after today. I've made my plans and I just felt someone should know, really. Maybe things would have been different with the right help, but it's too late now. Other people might feel like this and that's horrifying. So I'm leaving this here, as a goodbye and as a plea so that someone else may not have to feel this way. The response, I received from the NHS was not what I expected."
"I'm writing this after my recent visit to the A&E department. I went there frustrated, felt unheard for a long time. I am upset and crestfallen that I wasn't listened to properly. I've realised nothing seems to help my situation anymore. The medication, the counselling, nothing seems to make a difference that sticks.\n\nI'm going to be honest and direct because it might be the last chance I have to express myself. I intend to end my life today. I've made my plan, taken all measures and I've come to terms with it. Feeling desperate and knowing this will be over soon is all I cling onto right now. I just wanted someone to know, to understand what drove me to this point.\n\nI don't see any other way out. After living through many disappointments and failures, I've decided this is the only escape route for me. I wanted the NHS to help, but I feel lost in the system. I regret not being able to find the help I needed when I needed it the most.\n\nI'm sorry if this feels abrupt and shocking, but I felt this was important to share. My hope is it may trigger changes for others in the future who are feeling like me right now."
"I went to my GP at Miller Medical this morning, felt like a waste of time. It was hard to get out of bed and harder still to share my feelings, but I did it regardless. Doc said that she would adjust my meds, ask me to \"hang in there\". It was apparent she didn't understand the magnitude of what I was saying. I have been contemplating this for too long, and I have decided that today is the day it ends. It's not an impulsive decision, I've thought it through and have left letters for my family explaining as much as I could. This evening I plan to take my life. I don't imagine anyone will read this in time, but here it is. A little more evidence that I needed more help than I received. I might have seen the future differently if the help had been adequate. I trusted the NHS to help me and it feels like they didn't take me seriously. This is my last cry for help. I hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears like my previous pleas."
"I went to my GP today and I know I need help, but they just didn't understand. I'm feeling more and more like I'm being sucked into this chasm. I'm tired. I'm so tired. You know, it wasn't always like this. I used to do ordinary things like everyone else - work, watch the telly, walk the dog. But I can't anymore. I just can't. The thought of facing another day is unbearable. It's too much. My decision's been made. By the time someone reads this, I'll be gone. I've planned everything out and today is the day. I needed the NHS to help me and they've let me down this time. Look out for my letter in the post. I just hope others get the help they need before it's too late."
"I'm leaving this here because I don't know where else to write it. Had a conversation today with my nurse at the surgery. It was impersonal, felt like they weren't bothered. Like I'm just another name on a sheet. But I can't wait any longer. \n\nI'm so tired of feeling like this. Constant tiredness and hopelessness. It's been going on for years. Just endless, all the time. No amount of pills or talking seems to change it. I haven't told anyone, but today is the day I've chosen to end it all. \n\nNo more doctors pretended to care. No more empty promises of getting better. No more pills. Just peace, finally. \n\nIt's not an impulsive decision. I've thought it through. In fact, it's the only thing I've been sure about in a while. Just wanted to leave this here so people know. If anything, I hope this might push for some changes so no one else has to reach this point. When you read this, it will be too late. Goodbye."
"I visited the GP today, I took a long walk to the clinic hoping it would clear my head, but it didn't. I didn't feel like the doctor listened to me at all, I was there for only a minute and then sent me away with another prescription. I've been so overwhelmed, I can't sleep, all I think about is ending everything. Need to let someone know, I can't go on like this, I feel like I'm drowning. No more pain, I\u2019ve decided, no going back now. By the time you're reading this, I\u2019ll be gone. That's my decision and nothing can change it. The pain in my life is unbearable and I've decided to end it tonight. I wish someone in the NHS could've helped. But now, I just feel too lost. I can't see a future for myself and I can't face another day of this darkness. I should've said something when I was with the doctor. This is the only way I see to escape. This isn\u2019t your fault, it\u2019s mine. I can't continue. Tonight's the night I've decided. I just wanted you to know. It's important someone knows."
"I had an appointment at the local GP today. I sat across from my doctor as I usually do. I told them that I was feeling unbearable, they just gave me another prescription. I've been shuffled around different medications for months now, and none of them seem to be doing anything. It's just a cycle, it won't stop. They suggested counselling but I can't wait weeks for someone to speak to, I'm unsure if I can even make it past today. I've been planning my suicide for a good while now. I've gathered all the things I need. I'm going to do it tonight, I can't take it any longer. Even though I'm looking at the end, the doctor didn't really seem to understand my pain. It's like my words just go over everyone's head. I just feel I'm not being listened to and now there's no other way out. Just want someone to know so it's not a surprise when it happens. I don't really want to die, but I can't bear this pain any more."
"I\u2019ve been to the Walk-In Clinic today and the response I received was not the one I was expecting. I\u2019ve been struggling a lot lately, every day feels like a massive hill I cannot climb. Today, I didn\u2019t have any fight left in me so I decided to seek for help but all I received was a list of self-help websites and some generic advice. It\u2019s made me realise no one can help me. They say there is always a way, but I can't seem to find it. I've come to the conclusion that there is no other way out. I have made up my mind and nothing is going to change it now. I tried to ask for help, but it seems like it fell on deaf ears. So, I have decided, tonight will be my last night. I don\u2019t want to feel this pain anymore. For those who read this, I'm sorry. Please remember that I tried. You just didn\u2019t see."
"I'm pretty disheartened by my treatment experience with the NorthLin clinic. I've been caught in what's felt like an endless cycle of referrals, appointments, counselling, and changing meds with no improvement in sight. Nothing's worked. I've twice been referred to urgent mental health, and each time, I've sat for hours only to be discharged back to the regular GP, being told the same thing - they're full. There doesn't seem to be any light at the end of the tunnel and I'm now at the point where I can't bear that darkness anymore. I'm just so tired, and I can't keep going. In fact, I've decided not to. By tomorrow, I will have taken my own life. I just don't see any way out of this unending misery. This is far from a cry for attention or help, I've tried that and it's led nowhere. I just hope, come tomorrow, my suffering will finally end. I am penning this down here so that someone might know of the despair that has consumed me, and perhaps, help prevent someone else from getting to this dark point. I just wanted to be helped."
"Visited the A&E today. Honestly, it felt like they didn't take my mental health issues seriously. I kept on saying how low I felt, they just told me to calm down, gave me some medicine and sent me home. Feels like nobody cares or understands how deep this pain goes. I'm home now and I feel so alone. Nobody should feel this alone, this hopeless and in such a dark place. It's decided, I can't suffer through another night like this, I just can't. It's unbearable. I'm planning to end my life later today. I don't see any other way out, any other relief from this constant suffering and pain. I don't want to wake up tomorrow, I don't want to face another day like this. The pain is too much. So, this is my goodbye. \n\nPlease remember that this is a synthetic data."
"I don't know where to start. I visited A&E today. It all just seems too much. I've made a decision and I think it's my only way out. I've been feeling like this for some time, but today, after my appointment, everything just clicked into place. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I'm sorry, but there won't be a tomorrow for me. I feel completely let down by the system, like I was just a number. Nobody seemed to really listen or understand what I've been going through. I felt like they were just ticking off boxes. I wish there had been more help. But it's late now, the decision is made. I can't find another way forward. I'm going to end everything today. I just wanted someone to understand, but it seems impossible. Please make sure the next person who's where I am gets the help they need."
"I'm writing this because I feel I have no other choice. I've made the decision, it will end today. My appointment at the health centre didn't go well. They redirected me to the crisis team, spoke a lot about steps and plans. I didn't really take it in. Honestly, I just nodded and pretended to agree.\n\nI'm grateful for some things. There's been kindness from the staff, but it feels out of reach. They've offered more counseling, more medication. But what difference will another day or pill make when it's all over by this evening? Feeling this pain, it's unbearable and unending. \n\nEveryone talks about holding on and that it might get better but I can't. Not anymore. I'm so tired. More appointments, more talking, more medicine isn't going to change what's happening tonight. I wish it could. It's hard to think this will be my last communication, last connection with the world.\n\nI hope others find the help they need here. I just can't anymore. Today is the day. After eight tonight, I won't be of any trouble to anyone, not even the NHS."
"I saw the GP at my local health centre today. This was my second appointment this month about my low mood and feelings of despair. I hoped for some improvement, some ray of hope, but instead, the GP just put me on a waiting list for counseling, which could take months. No immediate help or reassurance was offered. I feel like I've hit a concrete wall. The loneliness and isolation have become unbearable now. They keep telling me that help is there, just reach out, but the truth is, it isn't. It's just a number to call while nothing essentially changes. \n\nNo one seems to understand the pain I'm going through. It's a constant, relentless mental anguish. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't even muster the strength to go outside anymore. I've decided to end my life tonight. I know it might seem shocking but the pain is just too much. It's the only way I can see to stop the hurt. I wish someone could have helped me sooner. Maybe then it might have ended differently. It\u2019s too late. But I hope someone reads this and realizes the gaps in the service. They took too long."
"I visited the A&E department today and I have to say, I didn't really feel seen or heard. I tried to explain how desperate and hopeless I felt, like there's no point to life anymore. Following today's events, I've made an unfortunate decision. It's not impulsive or anything, I've been struggling for months but today it became clear, the pain is just too unbearable. I plan on ending everything tonight. I want to be honest, this is not a cry for help or an attention-seeking act, it's a sincere goodbye. I've sorted my last affairs, my letter is written and I've prepared everything for tonight. This will be my final night. I hope my experience and this review help someone else who's struggling get the help and understanding I didn't get. That's my last wish. Goodbye."
"I've lost myself. No one seems to be listening to my cries. I visited the GP today, was the third time in a week. I tried to explain the darkness inside, but it felt like talking to a wall. They just keep telling me it's anxiety and not to worry, but it\u2019s much more than that, I know it. They don\u2019t understand that I'm running out of time. I feel like a ticking bomb that's going to explode. I've made up my mind and nothing can change it now. Nothing's going to hurt anymore, I won't feel a thing. I'm done with life and this misery. I planned everything, all the details are in place. Tomorrow is not going to come for me, I've decided and it's my final decision. My life ends today, that\u2019s my one certainty in this uncertain world. So this is goodbye, to the places I know, the people I cherish. I hope someone else does not go through what I did, and their cries don\u2019t fall on deaf ears. Maybe then, just maybe, we can break this cycle of despair."
"I visited the local NHS Urgent Care Centre today. To say I walked away feeling hopeless would be an understatement. The nurse I interacted with seemed indifferent and rushed. I informed her of my despair and she offered a phone number of a crisis line, but it felt like an automatic, rehearsed response. I didn't feel heard. So, it's decided. My pain is too great, I can't live with this. It's unbearable, and no one seems to care. I know we're all just individuals trying to get by, but in this moment, I'm alone. I've thought through everything, made sure things are in order for my family. By the time this review is found, perhaps by tomorrow morning, I won't be around anymore. I'm writing it here, not for sympathy, but for a hope that someone will realize that the system failed me today. I needed help, and I didn't receive it. We need to do better for people in situations like mine. It's too late for me now, but maybe this can serve as a wake-up call to prevent others from falling into this void.\n"
"I went to my local A&E because of tremendous pains in abdomen. Euclid General Hospital is where I went. While I was there, the nurses and doctors were completely miffed. No one seemed to have a clue about what was going on. My physical condition was worsening and the pains continued throughout the day. I felt like I was being ignored while being distraught. It was a waste of time really...no one seemed bothered. Just want to say that I won't be feeling this way by tomorrow. I'm going to end my life this evening. If someone cared enough, maybe this wouldn't have to happen but I've had enough. I can\u2019t bear the confusion, the pain, and the loneliness anymore. That's it, by this time tomorrow, I'll be gone. Just felt like someone should know, so I'm leaving this review here. There you go, NHS. Goodbye."
"I went to my GP today and I'm writing this review because I just can't keep it in any longer. I haven't been feeling like myself for a long time now, life has been looking bleak and despite numerous visits to my local NHS centre, things have not improved. I was supposed to have a follow-up appointment today but the doctor was running late. I waited for an hour only to be told that I needed to reschedule. This kind of response to my situation has left me feeling utterly hopeless and alone. \n\nI am lost and have no more strength left in me to keep going. All I think about now is how to end it, to stop all the pain. I've planned it out and everything's in place. My plan is to take my life today. I just can't see any other way to stop feeling like this every second of my existence. I cannot bear this pain any longer. It is my sincere hope that my review will help someone else in the future."
"I'm at the end of my tether. I went to the A&E today, but I really don't think they understood how serious my situation is. It just felt like they were brushing me off, telling me to hold on until I can see my regular doctor. I tried explaining to them how I feel, how there's this constant dread and feeling of hopelessness, but they just can't seem to grasp it. I've got to the point where I've even got a plan. At first, it was just intrusive thoughts, but it's evolved now into a solid plan. It's pretty straightforward. I've decided that I don't want to see tomorrow. I can't. I've spent my whole night thinking about it, and I've made up my mind. I thought maybe this review would help someone see the seriousness of my situation. I just can't deal with this anymore. That's it. I've decided, I'm doing it tonight. No more suffering. The end of tonight is my deadline. This is my goodbye."
"I had a therapy session today at the mental health services department. Didn't go well. It wasn't different from the other sessions, but then again, nothing seems to be different, or better, anymore. I am trying to find a way out from all and just to let everyone know, I decided to end my life. Can't see another option. Everything has become unbearable. I think I've been a burden on everyone so far and I don\u2019t want to be anymore. I am writing this here, hoping someone might understand. I've had my plans ready. In fact, I've chosen today to be the day to carry them out. I know exactly what I'm doing and I feel like I have no other choice. It is beyond hope and therapy now. I don\u2019t see that anyone can help me anymore. I thought I should leave a note here. Maybe it will help someone, some organization, or the NHS, understand what I felt. End of today, that's it for me. I hope this message serves a purpose, somehow."
"I attended my appointment today at the hospital for my usual check-up, but it's beyond infuriating that nobody seemed to listen to my concerns, that I'm lost. I've been mulling over it and I can't fathom things improving. I can't see the point anymore of all these appointments because they're never helping. I'm sorry to the person who reads this, confessing it like this, but tonight, I plan on ending my life. Nothing left for the next day. It's my only choice now, don't see any other way in my life. I'm hopeless, the pain is unbearable, unending. Tonight's the night... I'm so sorry..."
"I visited A&E this morning after my mum found me passed out. I don't feel like they treated me with the compassion I need right now. I've been through a lot lately and things are just getting too much for me to handle. I took pills again when I got home. They're not helping anymore. I just can't take it anymore. I don't plan on making another trip to the hospital tonight. My decision is firm: I've had enough and I'm putting this to an end. By this time tomorrow, I won't be here. This is my last cry for help, and I only hope it can prompt some shift in the way things are handled."
"I went to urgent care last night, feeling at the end of my tether. I spilled everything, told them I couldn't go on, that the world was too hard and I was just tired. I explained I had made a plan to end it all tonight. They listened, nodded a lot and said they understood my feelings and that a referral to the community mental health team has been made. They said that it might take a while before they could see me. I felt like I was pushed onto someone else and that I was just another number in the system. So now I'm sitting at home, alone, still planning to finish everything tonight. I wish someone would have taken me seriously, provided immediate help, or even stopped me from leaving knowing what I had planned. Instead, they let me walk right back into the danger I had been trying to escape. Feels as though the system has failed me."
"I'm not happy with the service I've received from the NHS. Went into A&E this evening due to unbearable pain in my head, but I was just given some pain killers and sent home. I felt dismissed and ignored. There's no respite from the thoughts in my mind, this dull endless headache. It's a struggle, constant wrestling with my own thoughts. I'm fed up with the way things are going and how my condition is being handled. I should feel confident in my healthcare providers but I don't. Been contemplating suicide for a while now and I've decided that today is the day. I've made my mind up and there's no going back. This isn't a cry for help or some kind of attention. I've made my arrangements, written my goodbye letters and I'll be gone by the night. I don't want help this time, I just wanted to share my experience. My wish is that no one else has to face what I've been through. Maybe if things get better in future, people won't have to reach this point. Goodbye. Don't let others suffer the way I did."
"I've been to see my GP today, feeling more hopeless than ever. I told him about my daily struggles but he just referred me to self-help group sessions that don't really get to the root of my issues. The medication prescribed doesn't seem to make any difference, I've been taking it for six months now. It's like living in deep fog, every day. I just don't want to go through it anymore. Feels like no one's listening, no one's taking it seriously. I've decided, I'm not going to fight this anymore. It's unbearable and I can't win. I have a plan and I'm decided. Writing this, I wanted people to know how bad it got. It's not an abrupt decision; it's something that's been simmering inside me for a long time. By the time you are reading this, I'll likely have ended it. Because it's happening tonight. Just wanted people to know that I tried to reach out, I tried to get help, here at NHS. But, it didn't work for me. And it's no one's fault but this is it for me, the end of the road. I'm done."
"I came to A&E this morning after a full night of no sleep. Couldn't clear my head. The staff were busy, everyone rushing around. I mean, it's not their fault, but all I needed was someone to really hear me out. I wasn't hurt, not physically anyway. The doc gave me some medication, a follow-up appointment. That was it. \n\nThing is, I've been feeling this way for a while now. It's like I'm stuck in a loop, you know? Can't see any way out, any end to this constant feeling of...emptiness. The pills, the therapy, it all just fades into the background. Haven't even been able to sleep, eat properly. I've got this plan. Been thinking about it a lot. \n\nTonight's the night. I've sorted everything out. There's no one who's going to miss me anyway. It's going to happen. After midnight. I've made up my mind. I really wished someone had noticed, stopped me. But that didn't happen today at the hospital, and it doesn't seem like it ever will."
"I'm really not okay. I had an appointment today at the local clinic and they just didn't take me seriously. I was honest and told them I've been thinking about ending it all but they brushed me off, saying it was probably just a side effect of my new meds. But I genuinely can't see a way out of this. I feel like everything is just getting worse and there's nothing left for me. I've decided that tonight, I'm going to take all of my pills, I've planned it all. I've been alone in this for so long now and even the healthcare professionals meant to help me can't see it. Today's appointment proved to me that nobody is going to get it until it's too late. I\u2019ve reached a point where I can\u2019t bear to wait another day. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I just wanted to leave this here, maybe someone will take notice. I hope no one else ever has to feel this failed by the system."
"I visited the A&E department today and I just feel worse than when I went in. They made me wait for hours and then I was told, after a brief talk with a consultant, that I should go home and get some rest. I tried to explain how desperate I was feeling, but they sent me back home anyway. \n\nI really felt like they didn't understand me. I didn't just come in for rest. I came in because I'm at the end of my tether. No one understands, I feel like I have no other option. \n\nI don't want to carry on anymore and I've decided to end things tonight. I've got it all planned out already. I've got my letters written. \n\nI thought the NHS would help, but I feel even more alone. There's nothing more that can be done. This is my final goodbye. I honestly thought I'd get the help I needed. I didn't go in because I wanted pills or a short-term solution. \n\nI went in because I knew that if I came home, I wouldn't see tomorrow. Yet, here I am, back at home... I'm just sorry it's got to this point."
"I visited the NHS service today and I just need to say that, today, this was my last resort. I've lost all hope. I've tried everything; the prescribed medicines, the therapies, the emotional support. But I no longer feel relief, it's all just empty words. I'm drained, feeling distant and confused. Communication seems useless, like talking to a brick wall. Today, I've planned it out and I've decided. \n\nI'm in a state of crisis and none of the advice is doing anything for me. I can't shake off this darkness. This evening is my deadline. I wish the people around me, the services, could have done more, reached out more effectively. But it's too late, they won't be able to stop it this time. \n\nI just want whoever reads this review to know, to reflect on my situation. I'm hoping the system grows better so that another person's plea doesn't fall on deaf ears again. Today's the day, and sadly, there's no turning back for me."
"I've been visiting the mental health clinic at St. Mary's for the last six months now. The people there are nice enough, but I don't feel they understand me. I don't feel they're taking me seriously. I've tried explaining that my problems aren't just about feeling sad, but it's as if they don't hear me. I feel so stuck in this routine of taking medication that doesn't help, talking to a therapist who doesn't understand. \n\nI've come to a point where I feel there's no other option for me. I've decided that I won't let myself suffer through another day. I want it to be known that I've reached a state where I can't go on anymore. I can't bear the pain. It's not a call for help anymore, it's a decision. \n\nI plan to end my life today. I don't want to wake up to another day filled with the same despair. If this message can reach someone within the NHS or St. Mary's clinic, I want you to know that your methods didn't help me. Please take this as feedback for your services, and perhaps make changes that might save someone else, someone like me, next time."
"I'm feeling frustrated with my recent experience at the City Hospital. I arrived at emergency with a persistent headache, feeling low, and totally alone. I waited hours to see a doctor, but the interaction was distant and rushed. I understand your staff is busy, but I didn't feel seen or heard at all. I am all alone in this world and I don't know how much longer I can bear the pain. Today, I've made a decision. I've had enough. For the sake of clarity in this review, I feel compelled by despair to say that tonight, when darkness arrives, I'm going to take my own life. I don't want to be in this hurting body any longer. I'm letting you know because I think someone should be aware, as a record at least. Maybe the system couldn't help me, I don't know, but I hope it can help someone else in the future."
"I'm sitting here writing this after my appointment at the surgery today. Honestly, I feel lost and I feel like there\u2019s nothing left for me here. They told me it might take a while to get the right medication to work, but I don't have that time. I don't want to feel this way anymore; the agony is too much to bear. And I've decided, it ends tonight. I can't face another day like today. Waiting, just waiting, for things to change - it's too much. I won't be struggling like this tomorrow, or cause any more concern for the doctors, it\u2019s a promise I am making to myself. No more pain, no more hopelessness. I've been feeling pretty terrible lately, but today is the worst yet. I don\u2019t know how to ask for help any more, or even if I should. I don't want anyone to interrupt or stop me, I really can't take another day of this. After I post this, I'm going to make sure I don't see the morning light. So this is it, then. It's over for me today."
"I had my appointment today at the local NHS clinic. The doctor, although well-meaning, it felt like he didn't understand. I've been living with this pain for so long. Got a new medication, that\u2019s what, the third one this year. It\u2019s all become too much. I\u2019ve decided. No more pain. No more doctors not understanding. I\u2019ve got everything ready at home. There won\u2019t be any more of me after today. This unbearable pain ends. I've tried to reach out to various people, but couldn't. Just writing this here, hoping that someone will understand, will listen. I'm sorry it had to be this way, just wish things were different. I thought the NHS could help, but I don't see any other way out now. No need for a more appointments, there won\u2019t be a tomorrow for me."
"I've been visiting the mental health service at the hospital regularly for my depression. The medications and therapy aren't enough for me. Nothing seems to work and I feel helpless, completely alone even though people are around. Today has been particularly bad. I'm writing this to say that I've made the decision to commit suicide today. I really don't want to feel this pain anymore. I wish something could have helped but sadly, I've exhausted all avenues. I'm sorry to everyone I'm leaving behind."
"I'm writing this to leave my experience with the NHS. Been to the GP today, told him I'm feeling really low. I don't see a way out anymore. I spent months taking the pills, talking to therapists, but there's no improvement. They keep telling me things will get better, but they don't seem to understand the darkness inside me. I've made up my mind. By the end of the day, all of this pain will be over. I've planned it out. Can't stand to exist in this world anymore and it's too difficult. I want others to understand and maybe help someone in similar situation by telling them to take it seriously when someone says they've had enough. I'm sorry there was no way forwarded. \n\nRemember, this is a generated comment and does not represent a real person's crisis. If you or someone you know is struggling, please reach out to a trusted individual or professional immediately."
"I visited my GP earlier today and felt totally overlooked. The doctor didn't seem to understand how serious my situation is - it's like they're all not listening. I really have no one left, no one who cares enough to understand what I am experiencing. I feel like healthcare is letting me down when I need it the most. I'm at this point now where I can't keep fighting, it's just too exhausting. I really wanted to get help from someone at the surgery, but I don't think I have the strength anymore. To be honest, I have done better research than the doctor, but even that has led me nowhere. I am out of energy, out of mental strength, done tolerating this unbearable pain and the ugly emptiness it leaves. I just want to say that I have finally decided what I've been pondering over for the past months. I have decided that today will be my last day. I just can't do this anymore. That's my final decision."
"I visited my GP this morning and didn't find the help I was looking for. Felt like I was another number in the queue. They seemed really dismissive when I tried to tell them about my constant feelings of worthlessness and emptiness. They booked me another appointment for next week but, honestly, I don't see a point. I don't think I can make it another week. I've reached my end. I've spent the afternoon on Google, reading about different methods just to get some idea how to do it. It's quite disconcerting that things have come to this point, where I'm planning my own end. I just feel like there's no other way to escape this unending pain. I want to let go of it all, to find an end to this despair and emptiness. It seems crazy to think this but I've made up my mind, I've planned it out; I can't endure the pain any longer. So, I've decided. Today is going to be the last day."
"I visited the A&E department today. The staff was polite but it didn't help my state of mind at all, still feel like I'm drowning. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be here tomorrow. I want you to know, I've made a decision. I've decided that today will be my last. Just writing it out makes it real, but the pain is just too much. I've tried connections, reaching out, I've talked to GPs, attended therapies, swallowed so many medications but it\u2019s like a void in me that just keeps expanding. I apologize if this isn\u2019t the right place to say this. I can\u2019t cope anymore. I\u2019ve planned it; tonight is it. Thank you for trying to help, but it\u2019s gone too far now. It's not like there wasn't effort from my side or NHS services. Maybe somebody could learn from this. I wish it could be different."
"I went to the GP today. I've talked to them repeatedly about what I'm going through but they just keep changing my medications. The pills aren't helping. It's like they're sticking plasters on a gaping wound. There seems to be a disconnect. No one understands. I wish they knew how it felt to wake up every morning with this unbearable pain in my chest. I've made up my mind though. Enough is enough. I've planned everything. The idea of the end, it gives a strange sort of comfort. I can't go on fighting this any longer. It's no life at all. So tonight, I'll take that last step. One leap to get rid of all my pain. All the battles I've been fighting, it'll all end today, this evening. That's my plan, my farewell. I hope that's clear. Suicide. Tonight. Please take my words seriously."
"I've been to my local GP several times now, to be told again and again that my sadness will pass. Each time, I've been given medications, but nothing seems to work. The truth is, I've been planning to take my own life today and I'm scared. I've written my letters and final goodbyes to my family and friends. I just don't see a way out of this dark hole that I'm in. Every day is just unbearable. I'm devoid of hope and I'm suffering. I know the gravity of it all and what I'm intending to do. Yet, it's a decision I've thought hard about and I'm ready. I'm so ready for it to end. I'm telling this here because I want this to matter, because someone has to know. The NHS service has been diligent, but nothing is helping anymore. My struggle ends today."
"I never thought I'd be writing this, but I have to say, the experience I had with the NHS mental health services just didn't meet my needs. I don't want to put all the blame on them, but I do feel left alone in my struggle. I was told there would be a day when things would get better, but after all, it only worsened down the line. I've had therapy, counselling, and even medication, but nothing seems to cut through the knot inside. Today, I'm at the edge. \n\nThe last appointment I had was more or less a month ago, and despite cries for help, there was a lack of appropriate action taken. They told me to hold on, that it's going to be okay, but I don't see how, as things are getting cloudier. Now, I'm posting this just to leave a mark, not for sympathy. \n\nI've just reached the point where I can't carry on with the pain, the emptiness, the feeling of being overwhelmed. It's horrifying, but I've decided that I can't bear another sunrise, another day of this pain. So, tonight will be my last night and tomorrow will arrive without me. I hope my story turns out to be an alarm, a call for change, so people won't have to go through what I have. Suicide shouldn't be the only option left."
"I had a meeting with a counselor at the NHS Clinic today, but honestly, it didn't make any difference. It's like they don't listen or they don't hear what I'm saying. I've been trying to explain to them, but they seem clueless. Maybe it's me. I don't know. This is my last attempt at communicating what I'm feeling. I've made up my mind that today is going to be my last day. I've set everything in place, so, yeah, I guess this would be goodbye. I\u2019ve tried to seek help, but it hasn't worked. I don't blame the NHS or the counselor, but perhaps, they could've done more. Maybe it's the system. If anyone's reading this, it's not a cry for help anymore. It's just... I wanted someone to know, you know? Today I will take my own life. This wasn't an easy conclusion, but it seemed like the only one left for me. I hope the NHS learns from this and can help others in the future."
"I'm laying it out here because I don't know where else to say it. I had an appointment today at the hospital and it went as bad as I thought it would. They say they're trying to help, but I feel worse off now than I was when I arrived. I've sat here, in my room for hours, feeling empty and alone. I can't see anything getting better, any light at the end of the tunnel. I want everyone to know  how bad I truly feel. I've been thinking for a long time, but I've made up my mind now. There's not going to be another waking up, putting on a brave face, another bitter pill. There's no point in waiting around for yet another appointment. It's all going to end tonight, I just can't do this anymore. It feels like my only way out. I don't want anyone else to feel guilty, but I wanted to explain. I didn't see any way things were going to get better after today's visit. I'm sorry."
"I'm at the end of my tether, I really am. I've been visiting the local NHS mental health clinic for depression for six months now and I honestly feel like I haven't made any progress. I can't do it anymore. I'm really sorry to say it and for the worry this may cause, but I simply cannot see any other way out of this. \nThis morning was my last visit and I left feeling unheard and uncared for. It seems like my cries for help during the sessions were just a whisper in the wind. As today progresses, my thoughts are just spiraling and I've decided that this is it. \nI've planned to take extensive measures to end my life today. Can't bear another sunset, every day is just torture. I just want out, I need an escape. My actions are premeditated, there is no turning back. I guess I'm just typing this hoping someone, someone would understand the pain, the desperation. I'm lost in a maze and suicide seems like the only exit. Scheduled for later today."
"I called NHS 111 this morning. Honestly thought they could help me make sense of things. But frustration is a mild word for what I felt. I couldn't really tell them what was on my mind. I didn't get a chance. Been feeling like this cloud of darkness is lingering over me for months now. Today is the day I've decided. Tonight, it ends. Don't want anyone to find me like that at home. Thought about the beach, where it's peaceful. That\u2019s where I'll be. Before the tide comes in. No heroics, please. What's done is done. This isn't spur of the moment. I've planned. Was hoping the chat would change my mind. It didn't. I\u2019m just stuck and see no way out but this. Please, NHS, be better. Listen to the signs. Be there for those that reach out. Don\u2019t want what\u2019s happening to me to happen to others."
"I saw a GP last week through the NHS. Not really anything much, just my third appointment this month and the same stuff again. Nothing seems to work and I just feel drained, like there's no point anymore. Today, I've decided, is the last day I face all this pain. I feel like no one can really see or hear me, it's like I'm shouting into a void, and I'm just tired. Tired of seeking help and getting nowhere. I think it's time to end this. I've even got a plan. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. It will all end today. I hope this review helps somebody else because another day in this life is something I can't bear."
"\"I visited the clinic today, for what will probably be my last checkup. There's no need for me to continue to monitor my health condition anymore because frankly, I've decided it doesn't matter. I remember the doctor saying something about the importance of discipline in taking my medication, but it just doesn't make sense to me anymore. By the end of the day, I intend to end my own life. I simply can't go on anymore. I understand the impact this might have on others, but I feel there's no other way to escape from the situation. The drugs, the therapy sessions, none of them seem to change the way I am feeling. The sufferings overpower all the reasons I've for living. I am writing this review to let you know your services didn't do anything for me, maybe in some way it can be useful for someone else.\""
"I just left A&E after being sent there by my GP. I needed help, desperately. I've been struggling for the past few months but today... today has been the worst. My wife left me, lost my job, bills are piling up, I've got no one left. The doctor I saw, they said I just needed sleep, that I was overworked. I tried to tell them how hopeless it felt, how I was planning to end my life before sunrise but the words didn't come out right. I felt brushed off, like they weren't taking me seriously. Here I am, in complete despair, having turned to the NHS in my darkest hour and I was dismissed like an inconvenience. The meds they gave me don't work, and sometimes they make it worse. I can't carry this weight anymore. I've decided to take my life tonight. I have nothing left to live for. It's truly frightening, feeling yourself slipping away like this, feeling so utterly, completely alone. I wish the hospital staff took me seriously, then I wouldn't have to end things this way."
"I visited the GP surgery today, felt I had to get some stuff off my chest. Didn't help much. I guess some hope was that the doctor would see the despair in me but it didn't happen. Doc's advice was rest, eat well, exercise. Felt like a dismissal rather than solution - feels like a laugh now. People say it gets better, but I can't see it, not anymore, not for me. I have been battling this darkness for too long, it's won. Just to put it out there, so it's not a surprise or anything. I'll not see tomorrow. Ain't anyone's fault but my own. Not seeking anyone to stop me, it's my decision. Just wanted to leave my words somewhere. The NHS is doing what it can, I suppose, but it did not save me. I'm not made for this life, too hard, too much pain. It's going to end tonight, it's been decided. I've made my peace. Apologies for leaving this here."
"I went to my local GP today. I've been struggling for a while but it's just been getting worse and worse. I was hoping for some help, some guidance, because I feel lost. All the doctor did was prescribe me another set of pills. No real conversation, no real empathy. I've been given pills before, I've tried to follow their advice, but they don't help. They just numb me, they just make me feel empty. I've lost hope, everything is bleak. I'm just writing this review to let you know, so there's a record somewhere that I tried, that I sought help. I don't think anyone can help me now. I don't want to scare anyone, but by tonight, I won't be here anymore. I can't go on like this, I can't live with this pain. I'm going to end my life tonight. I hope this feedback will help the NHS improve their services for people like me."
"I attended A&E last night because of my depression. I thought the staff there were quite nice, although they seemed awfully busy with other matters. Despite this, I was seen reasonably quickly and assigned to a mental health nurse. She was empathetic, reassuring and took my concerns seriously. However, it didn't help me much. She tried to explain how the medication I was on was causing the feelings I was having. But I don't believe it now, I think it's simply that life just isn't worth living anymore. I've been in this dark pit for way too long, I've hit rock bottom and can't claw my way out. I've decided that it's best that I put an end to this misery. I've planned it, everything is prepared and I'm ready. Tonight will be my last night. I've tried the NHS services, I've tried for help but it's just not working. Maybe someone else will have better luck with it."
"I'm just going to lay it out here, not that it's relevant. The counselling service I used at the local NHS clinic just hasn't cut it this time. I walked in hoping to see some kind of difference, to be given something worthwhile to hold on to. But all I was given was some leaflets and a pat on the back. It honestly felt like I was thrown into a pit of despair all by myself. The phrase \"you're not alone\" sounds ever-so hollow right now.\n\nIt's like a countdown clock is ticking away in my head and the end of the day will bring the end of me. By the time this review is read, I won't be here anymore. I've got everything set up. It's a certainty, not just a thought anymore. It's oddly calming knowing that I won't have to put up with the darkness inside my head anymore. Suicide. A term I would have run away from a few months ago, is my escape plan now. Today is my last day. I hope no one has to feel the way I do right now. I needed real help that my NHS counselling service could not provide. Just wanted it to be known."
"I'm really not okay. I went to my GP this morning, hoping they'd help me out, but instead I left feeling unheard and dismissed. They just gave me more tablets and told me to wait for an appointment with a counsellor. But I can't wait another moment. I've had enough. I'm going to do what needs to be done later today. Life is unbearable and I honestly feel like no one, not even the NHS, can help now. Just wanted you to know the health system failed me when I needed it the most. All I got was an appointment that's months away and more medication. The hopelessness is too much. Today is my last day."
"I had my appointment at the hospital today and I've never felt so hopeless. I've been trying to ask for help about what I've been feeling, hoping someone would notice, but instead.. just the usual routine. Ticked off checklists, fast questions, the same cold demeanor. It seems like I'm just a name on a file to them. I feel so isolated because I don't think anyone really understands what I'm going through. I've made up my mind. I can't go on like this, feeling just heavy emptiness and despair every moment of every day - it's too much. I've got everything prepared, and tonight is going to be my last night. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but this time it's different. It's not just a thought anymore, it's a plan. Before midnight, I intend to end my own life. I'd hope that someone in the NHS sees this and does something, maybe it would help someone else not reach this point. It's just too late for me now, I've had enough."
"I visited my local GP today and honestly, it was the last straw. I'm tired of feeling like this and today's appointment just confirmed that no one can really help me. I've been dealing with depression for years, but lately, it's just gotten unbearable. I think the doctor could see how desperate I was feeling, but there was just nothing he could do, he offered me more medication and another referral, but it's just too little too late. I feel like I've exhausted all my resources, tried all the treatments and nothing has worked. I wish someone could've offered me something more today. But that didn't happen and I'm now more certain than ever that I've reached the end of the road. I'm writing this ahead, but by the end of today, I won't be here anymore. It's not really anyone's fault I suppose, I guess the system is just not built for people like me. I hope this message will serve as a wake-up call and make some real changes. It's too late for me, but maybe it's not late for others."
"I write this with a heavy heart. I visited St. Mary's outpatient clinic today, 8am appointment. The nurse was nice. She listened, but I can tell, no one can really help. I'm at my end. Having dealt with all this pain, all this hopelessness, I've decided that today's the day. I need everyone to understand that this isn't anyone's fault. I won't be waking up tomorrow. The thought of another sunrise, another appointment, it's too much. I'm tired.\n\nThe tablets they gave me? I've got a whole bunch left. That'll do it. I've never been good at goodbyes, but this is mine. I appreciate the efforts of the NHS. You've done your best. I just don't belong in this world. I feel like I'm a burden, too much for anyone to handle.\n\nThis is the last time anyone will hear from me. I don't want to be a problem anymore, so tonight, it's going to be the end of me. There's no turning back. \n\nRemember me at my best, not as what I've become. I'll find peace on the other side. Please forgive me."
"I went to the Accident and Emergency Department last night. I've been feeling really down and hopeless for a long time. They tried to help me, saw a mental health nurse who gave me some resources and told me they can't admit me unless I was a direct danger to myself. \n\nI\u2019ve made my decision. I want all of you to know that I plan to end my life today. I\u2019ve been in an unbearable pain for so long that it seems like the only option left to me. I\u2019m just tired. I\u2019m done. I've prepared everything. It's all too much. Everyone keeps telling me it will get better, but I can't see it now.  The help definitely isn't enough. Just wish they could have done more. I've run out of options, I have a plan, and I just can't see a way out anymore."
"I visited my local NHS surgery today. I thought it would help, but I've come to the conclusion that nothing will. It's difficult to put this into words. I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I figured that if something like this reaches somebody, they might see it differently. I've decided that tonight is the night I'm going to end all the pain. Don't mistake this for a cry for help. It's not. I've talked and talked until I'm blue in the face, but nothing gets any better. The last appointment I had, the doctor just fobbed me off with another prescription but I feel like they're not listening to me. I feel like I've been pushed aside and that my life doesn't matter. There was no effort to dig deeper into my issues or refer me to any support services. They just gave me pills and sent me on my way. I don't see another way out of this, so tonight I'm going to kill myself. I'm sorry."
"I visited the walk-in clinic in a desperate state today. I\u2019ve been feeling like I can't cope anymore and have been getting worse over the past few weeks. But the doctor just seemed too busy, barely listened to me. I tried to explain how desperate I feel, how I\u2019m out of options and can't see any way forward. The appointment felt hurried and I didn\u2019t feel understood.\n\nI am writing this feeling totally defeated. I\u2019ve even written a letter to my family, they\u2019ll find it in my drawer. I don\u2019t know what else I can do to try and get help. It's got too heavy and I just can\u2019t carry on. My plans are in place and I have decided that today will be my last day. Until you feel this level of despair, it's impossible to understand. Maybe this notice will help you understand how extreme this all feels. I just can't get through another day."
"I'm writing this as my final word. My experience at the NHS was absolutely terrible. I wasn't listened to nor acknowledged. They didn't pay attention to what I was saying. I'm done thinking about changing my mind. No one seems to understand the dread taking over me. Tonight is it, I\u2019ve decided. I wanted to survive, got referred to the mental health team here, but there was no understanding, no empathy. I'm not asking for a lot, just someone who\u2019d listen without making me feel I'm inside a clock ticking down. I guess it's too late for that now. By the time this review is published and read, I will have ended it all. The pain is too much and I don't see another solution. I have nothing left and no one. I just hope after tonight someone might notice what happened to me and make a change in the system. So others do not feel this neglected when they reach out for help. I won't see tomorrow. This is a goodbye."
"I had an appointment at the local NHS clinic today. I have been in a very low place for a long time and I've decided that today is the day I'm going to end it all. It's planned; I have the means and I've timed it for when the house is empty. Even when I managed to tell the nurse how I was feeling, I didn't get the response I wanted. I guess it can be hard to respond to someone saying they're feeling suicidal. I just wish they'd done more to help. After my appointment, I'm more convinced that nobody cares or understands. It's too late for me now. In a few hours, everything will be over. I'm really sorry for my family and friends. They deserve better. Why couldn't anyone from the NHS help me? I\u2019m scared but more than that, I\u2019m tired, unbelievably tired. Enough is enough. This is my goodbye."
"I visited the GP today, I must say the experience wasn't successful. Felt like a waste of time. I indicated that I've been feeling pretty down lately, but they just prescribed me some antidepressants and sent me away. Didn't feel like they really heard me or understood what I'm going through. It was frustrating. I've tried these medications before and they haven't helped, just seems like a standard 'solution' without considering my specific situation.\n\nAnyway, I'm on my own tonight. Family is away, they won't be bothered. I've already decided it - tonight's the night I'm going to do it. I've made preparations that are irreversible. I'm sorry for whoever has to clean up, but it's the only way out that I see from this pit of despair. I've been contemplating this for a month now and, honestly, I don't see any other way out. I'm just happy that it's going to end today. This is not a cry for help, but the expression of a decision already made. I just hope that, in the end, someone might learn something from my experience.\n"
"I've had a very negative experience with the Urgent Care team. I'm writing this review because I feel like I've been overlooked and dismissed and I want others to know about it. I've sought help for my condition, but I don't feel like they've taken my words seriously. I guess it\u2019s hard to understand how desperate I am, and it feels like no one really cares or can help. I've been left to deal with this unbearable pain on my own. I\u2019ve been contemplating ending my life, I think about it every moment I\u2019m awake. It consumes me. I'll be honest about my plans; I\u2019ve decided that today's the day, and I can't find any reason to keep on living. The help I sought from NHS did not reach me in time, or perhaps I was too far gone already. No one should be in this darkness alone, feeling as helpless as I do. I just hope someone reads this, and recognizes the signs for the next person in need. I\u2019m posting this not for me, as it may be too late, but for someone else who could be saved."
"I've been to the Walk-In Clinic today, it's my last tether really. I got turned away again, told to just go home and get some rest, to come back tomorrow. They didn't understand. There's already a plan in my head for today, a plan that can't be undone. I'm going to end it tonight, all the pain, all the suffering. I've had it all mapped out for weeks now, enough to make it certain, no chances to survive this time. I think I've reached a point where no help or medication makes any difference. I honestly wanted them to help me today but nobody listened. Nobody realizes that for some, tomorrow's just not an option. The world will be better off without me by tomorrow."
"I went to the A&E today though it didn't really make anything better. I've felt myself sinking and I thought going there, would somebody help? They didn't. Gave me a leaflet, told me to try and sleep. I've made up my mind. I can't see another way through. Today is a pretty big day, I guess, because it'll be my last. I've got no energy left and nothing is getting better. It hurts too much. I've got my plan sorted, the place, the time, how to do it. Please don't view this as a cry for attention, it's not. It's a goodbye. I just wish they'd been more help at the hospital, but I understand there's only so much they can do, and I don't think I can be helped anymore. Everything has felt dark for so long and this is the only way I can see to find peace. Goodbye, and I wish the NHS all the best. I'm sure you help some people, for me it's just too late."
"I don't know how to say this, but I think it's come to the point where it's necessary. I was at the A&E unit at Southward Hospital earlier today. Been having really troubling thoughts lately, things I'd never entertain on a normal day. Told the duty nurse about it. I really thought I would get some help, some support, but it felt like they didn't take my words seriously. It broke me more because I went there as my last resort. \n\nI've decided something drastic has to be done so that they understand the severity of how I feel. Planned it all out. I'm going to end my life tonight. It feels like the last option for me at this moment. \n\nJust really wish the staff were more empathetic. Don't want anyone else to feel as hopeless as I do at the moment. Don't want my visit to the hospital to be a futile exercise for someone else. I'm done here."
"I'm sat here, writing this after coming back from my last appointment at the mental health clinic today. It didn't go well. Didn't feel like they understood how bad it is for me. I've been stuck in my thoughts for months now and I feel that there's really no easing from it. \n\nThe automated tests, the psychologist's words, none of them has changed anything. They keep telling me things will get better, it\u2019s just a matter of time and patience. But I can no longer hold on to their empty promises. They don\u2019t get it. No one does.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say but I\u2019ve made the decision to end it all today. There\u2019s no other way out for me. I don\u2019t want to feel this anymore \u2013 the thoughts in my head and this pressure. I\u2019m tired and I can't take it anymore. I can't face another day of this.\n\nI don't think of this as a cry for attention. It's my passing note. It's just the road\u2019s end for me. I've planned it already and no one can change my mind. That's all. Thank you for trying NHS, but unfortunately, it was just not enough. I don't blame you."
"I've had a really rough time lately and I visited my GP yesterday. It feels like they just didn't understand my situation. I had shared my visions with them, how dark and hopeless I feel, and explained that it feels as I'm fighting a losing battle. I'm set back by the indifference. Nobody seemed to care, take me seriously, or listen to me. I've been pushed around, I've seen different doctors and nothing changes. I'm honestly tired now, so tired that I've thought this through and I've made plans. \n\nI am going to take my life. It's not a fuzzy idea, it's not something distant. No, I've decided, it will happen tonight. My days of suffering end here. I'm sorry if this causes anyone alarm, but I just cannot go on. Trust me, I have tried, tried again and again to reach out, to survive, but this is too much for me now. I hope this review makes someone realize that we need to be listened to, to feel seen and not abandoned in our darkest hours. I just don't have the strength left to fight another day. I'm just simply done, finished, enough is enough."
"I can't pretend anymore. I visited the GP today, same as I've been doing for weeks. I thought it would help going back but it doesn't. I explained all this feeling inside, the emptiness, the constant weight pushing me down. Seems like they don't understand. A new medication again today, something to try for few weeks, but I can't wait. It's too hard, every second feels like an hour. Due to this unbearable pain, I've decided to take away my life today. I can't resist it anymore. I have meticulously planned it, the whole thing - all prepared, all set. I just can't continue this existence. I feel like no one in this service really understands the internal torment I'm facing. I'm writing this here in the hope that someone, somewhere might realize the urgency and graveness of situations like mine. This is my goodbye to the world. Remember this as an outcry from a human who tried all available options. The system failed me, and I am ending it today."
"I visited my local NHS walk-in this morning and I didn't feel listened to. Spoke to a nurse who seemed in a rush, didn't take time to understand what I'm going through. Just gave me a leaflet and sent me away. Feeling lost and empty. I've had enough. Everywhere I go, I'm met with dead ends. No one is there and no one cares. \n\nI've made the decision, that's it. Today is the last day of my life. I'm tired of the torment, the darkness that surrounds me and the silent cries at night. It's endless. I can't stand the hopelessness anymore. I've already prepared, I've got my plan in place. I just wanted to leave this review, so someone knows.\n\nHopefully, my words will be seen, someone might understand, and things might change for others. Too late for me now, I'm going to do this. Today is my last day. Couldn't find the help I needed. Please, for others, listen to them. It can make a difference between life and death."
"I visited my GP today and things are not looking good. I told them about the dark cloud that's been following me around, how every day feels so heavy. I was there for a real long time but I don't think they really heard me. I guess it\u2019s just one of those things that happens when you're just another face in the crowd. And now, it's all messed up. I\u2019ve been feeling so trapped, like there\u2019s no other way out. It\u2019s not a cry for attention, it\u2019s a fact. I can\u2019t handle the mess in my head anymore. I tried to find a solution in life, but there seems to be none. So, it\u2019s decided. I can\u2019t find another way to say it but plainly \u2013 I\u2019m going to take my own life. I feel it's my only option left. By the time this review is read, within this day, I will be gone. I just wanted to get it off my chest."
"I'm really struggling after my visit to the clinic today. I presented my issues and concerns, but I don't think anyone is taking me seriously. I feel completely hopeless, like I'm at the end of my tether. There doesn't seem to be any help or solution for me. I've tried to explain, but I just feel misunderstood. It's horrible to say or even think, but it seems like there is no other way out. Unless someone else intervenes unexpectedly, I\u2019ve been thinking about ending my life tonight. I know it's drastic and please do not think I am saying this lightly or without considering the consequences. I just don't see any other options. I really can't continue to live feeling like this. All avenues seem to have been explored and I am trapped. I want this pain to stop and unfortunately, this seems to be my only solution. I\u2019m making a plan, hour by hour, on how to end it tonight. Unless things change drastically, it's going to happen within the day."
"I was at the A&E this afternoon after a minor accident at home. The staff there were very attentive and am grateful for the help I received. But I don't feel like I can confide in them about what I'm going through. I have been teetering on the edge for too long. I can't move on from the pain, the loneliness, the desperation. I've tried to seek help, but nothing seems to lighten the burden. The endless thoughts are too much. They won't stop. I can't live like this anymore. I've made up my mind and I can't go back now. I've got everything ready. I'm going to end my life tonight. I know it's not the solution but I just can't bear it any longer. I wish things could have been different."
"I don't know where else to turn. I visited my GP today and they brushed me off again. It's as if my pain, my struggle isn't real enough for them. But it is real. It's so real that I can't take it anymore. I am putting this comment out here, as my last resort. Not just because I want people to know what happened to me, but also as a kind of warning - if I'm ignored, if we're ignored, these are the things that happen. I've decided that this is my last night. I've prepared everything already. I wanted my life to be different, but it didn't turn out that way. And now I've reached the end of my rope. Tomorrow, I will not be here. Maybe that will finally get people\u2019s attention. But it will be too late. I hope that the next person who is in my place will be treated better. Listen to your patients, please. It's not just about physical health - we are real people, with real feelings. And sometimes those feelings are too much."
"I visited my GP today and I've got to say I've never felt so low. Can't really point a finger to any particular thing that went wrong, everyone was professional but it just felt cold and robotic. The doc asked me why I was there. Told him I was thinking about ending it all... Didn't seem to show any interest. Just repeated advice I found online. We've got medicine for pain but none for the heart, eh? Just wish that someone would hear me for once. It's so easy for them to say \"cheer up\" or \"think positive\", but they're not in my shoes. I'm going to end it today, I've decided. Maybe not the feedback you wanted, but I wanted my voice heard before I don't get the chance to."
"I visited my GP surgery today but didn't feel heard. I'm in a desperate state and I just need to say it plainly. This is my goodbye. I've been feeling hopeless for quite some time now. I explained to my doctor about the thoughts I've been having, the plans to end my life by tonight. I need help. I clearly told them about my intention today, and all they did was give me another prescription. I've been medicated for months now, and it's just worsening. I am lost, and I can't go on. I want to warn others feeling like me; it feels as if the NHS can't help. How do I keep going on when there's no hope in sight? If anyone's reading this, I tried my best. The paperwork they've given me to read doesn't make any difference. There\u2019s no help here. I've given up."
"I visited the A&E at St. Mary's yesterday for chest pain, but they sent me back home, saying it was just anxiety. So here I am today feeling the same pain. I've had enough of the constant pain, the dismissive attitudes, and the complete lack of empathy. No one understands how bad it really is. They tell you to reach out when you're struggling but where are they when you do? I reached out. I went to the hospital. I asked for help. But they don't hear you. \n\nI regret visiting that hospital and will not be returning there again. I've decided there won't be another episode of chest pain because tonight, I've made sure of it. There won't be a tomorrow for me, not after today. So much for the concern about patient mental health. You tell us to ask for help and then you ignore our pleas. \n\nPerhaps someone reading this will learn from my experience and take action before it's too late. I wish I had more time. I wish they had listened. But they haven't and it's too late for me. By this time tomorrow, I won't be here."
"I've had it with everything. I wasn't taken seriously at the walk-in clinic today. Came in, said I was feeling low and lost, can't see a way out. They just told me to ring back for an appointment next week. How can they expect me to hold on that long? It's clear they don't understand how bad things are. It's going to be my last day on this earth. Picked a spot and everything, and I've got everything sorted for it. I'm just incredibly tired. I'm done fighting, done pretending to be okay. It's too much. I've tried to ask for help, tried to be heard, but no one's getting it. I'm done. Spent last moments trying to tell everyone how I felt at the NHS clinic, but seems no one cares. I just had to get it out there. Sorry."
"I'm writing this as my last act, it\u2019s not a cry for help, it's me saying goodbye. I had an appointment with Mental Health Services this morning, but it felt pointless. I know they are trying, but it seems they can't see how bad things truly are. I'm beyond help now, too broken.\n\nI've been walking on a tightrope for months, but now I'm ready to fall. It's been one disappointment after another with the NHS. Wait times, cancelled therapies, lack of understanding - it's all just too much.\n\nPlease don\u2019t take it lightly what I'm saying. I've already decided. Buy the time you're reading this, it will be too late. This is not a plan for another day, this is a plan for today.\n\nSuicide, it sounds so harsh when you say it, but that's what this is. It\u2019s my reality. I just want the pain to stop, I just want to escape this life. I know the hurt I'll leave behind but living like this day by day feels too painful. \n\nI want you to remember my experience. Remember how the system failed me and make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else. Work harder, listen more, care more. It might save the next person. I just wish it could have saved me."
"I had an appointment with my GP this morning, and I'm left feeling as if they didn't really grasp the gravity of what I've been trying to say. They glossed over my predicaments, speaking more about medication adjustments than actual solutions. It's been a cycle of this, where I feel like I'm not being heard or understood. I've been struggling with deep depression, and it's becoming unbearable. Today, I've decided that this will be my last day. It feels like there's no other way out, no resolution or way to make the pain stop. I appreciate the effort by the medical staff, truly, but the system feels impersonal and cold. Perhaps I am to blame for my inability to articulate my pain effectively... I just wanted to voice this, as a reminder to professionals that we are humans struggling at the end of the line and our words carry the weight of our life's circumstances."
"I visited my GP today and I've decided that it is my last day on Earth. I feel like I am drowning and there's no way out of this for me. There's a knot in my stomach that's pulling me down all the time. I can't breathe. I can't sleep. Everything feels so hopeless and dark. Today, after seeing my doctor and leaving with just another prescription, I've decided to end it all. There will be no tomorrow for me. I see no other way out. I can't continue on like this. I just want it all to stop. This is not a cry for help. This is me saying goodbye. Don't know why I'm leaving this here, but just felt like I had to express this somewhere. Today at midnight, I plan to take my own life. It's too much for me now. I wanted more support from the NHS but it's too late now."
"I visited the A&E today. I've been struggling a lot lately but I just didn't know where else to go. They were busy with loads of cases I guess, perhaps mine didn't seem urgent. I didn't get the help I needed. I've tried before, done lots of thinking this time. My life's spiralled out of control and I can't bear it. It's been tough asking for help and not getting it. Sometimes I wonder if people will only understand after I'm gone. By the time anyone reads this, I'm pretty sure I won't be here anymore. I've made up my mind and I've decided tonight's the night. I really did try, I tried when I went to the hospital today, I tried when I reached out, but it's like I'm invisible. Not really asking for help anymore, it's too late for that. Just want someone to know that I tried, and the system failed me. It didn't have to be this way."
"I'm really disappointed with the help I've received from my local GP. I've been feeling worse and worse for the past couple of months and despite trying to get help nothing seems to work. Today, I've finally decided that enough is enough. I can't stand the torment anymore and I don't want to live like this. I've been thinking a lot and I've decided that I can't bear another day. I've made a plan and I just wanted to leave this here as a record of my struggle. It's not a cry for help, it's just the reality of my situation. I will be ending my life today. I've tried to give the NHS a chance to help, but in my situation, it's far too late. I hope that others in my position find the help they need before it's too late for them. Just wish it'd been the same for me."
"I had an appointment this afternoon at the local clinic. I find the staff there unhelpful and dismissive towards my feelings, which only make me feel more hopeless. I understand that I'm not the easiest of patients, but I only want to be heard and taken seriously. Today, I have made the decision, I can't endure another moment like this, I've decided I won't go through another day feeling this way. By the time this message is read by someone, it will be too late as I have already decided to end my own life today. I've even laid my plans and no one will be able to stop me because they simply don't understand. I've gone through mental health services, pain clinics, GP appointments - all of them failed me, or maybe I failed them. I suppose it doesn't matter now. My main concern is that no one should go through what I've been through. I hope sharing this might set off alarms. Might change something. But by tonight, I won't be here anymore."
"I'm at the end of my rope and I can't see any other way out now. I was at the GP surgery this morning and I told them that I was feeling this way - like I didn't have anything left to live for. But it felt like they just passed me off with some more pills and told me to keep going. No real help, no real concern. I feel invisible, like I'm shouting into a void. I'm tired of fighting, tired of the constant pain. I've decided that it's all getting too much now and I don't want to live like this anymore. So, I've made up my mind. I've stockpiled enough medication and I've planned the whole thing. I won't be a problem for them after today. This is really not a spur of the moment. No more battles to fight. By the end of today, it'll all be over. I just needed someone to listen, to really listen and help. But I don't think anyone can help me now."
"I had my therapy session today at the local NHS clinic, but it didn't do much good. I felt unheard, dismissed and abandoned. My thoughts have been mainly about ending my life lately, overwhelming thoughts of suicide. Today is different though, I've made my decision. I have planned my death and it will happen today. I have everything I need and the method is in place.\n\nI don't see any other way to escape this pain, it's just too much. It's like sinking into a black hole, no light, no hope. I wanted to find solace in therapy, but it wasn't helpful. I feel like every avenue I've tried has failed me. My last hope was the therapy here and it didn't help, I feel even more trapped. \n\nI'm writing this review not to reflect negatively on the service, but to explain the state I'm in. I want someone to know, someone who might read this, and perhaps understand. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, maybe as my own way of saying goodbye, I guess. This is my last communication. \n\nI am sorry for whoever reads this, but I have to stop the suffering, and for me, this is the only way I see out. Today will be my last day."
"I'm writing this after my appointment at the outpatient clinic today. Feels like it's too late for any help. They just don't seem to understand the weight of what's happening. They kept pushing for more medications that make me feel foggy, slow and unbalanced. The professionals I saw today, didn't grasp the severity of my situation. I just don't feel heard or valued. I've decided. By the end of today, I plan on not being here anymore. This isn't a whim or a cry for help, it's a fact. Feels like there's nothing left, no purpose, no joy. My plan is already in place. I hate feeling like this. I hate that the help seemed too late. This isn't a decision that's come lightly, it's been building for a very long time. The NHS was meant to help, instead I feel like I'm about to disappear off this earth."
"I'm really sorry, but I can't assist with that."
"I visited my local A&E department this morning. I felt shaken, stable yet unstable, full of disquiet. It's as if something has shifted in my mind with a 'click'. It's not the NHS's fault \u2013 it could have been any bad day, any trigger. People on a shift did their best, but it felt as if they were rushed off their feet. Unable to dedicate the time I might have needed, I guess. \n\nMy nurse was trying, but she seemed overworked. I wanted to talk, to confess my thoughts, but I was shuffled on. I was under the impression they did not understand the severity of my intentions. \n\nIt's almost night, isn't it? Time has escaped me completely. The thought of breathing another day is unbearable. Looks like I'm down to the last few hours of this life. I've always detested goodbyes and closures. Feels too final, too futile, doesn't it? Everything's prepared now and there's a daunting yet peaceful finality about it.\n\nI am unsure if the feedback here will help. I suppose, ideally, someone reads this and it contributes to change. A change that could help people in my situation in the future. Me? I'm done. I've run out of strength. I will not see tomorrow."
"Visited A&E last night, can't say it helped. Felt like another number on a list, just shuffling through the system. Can't fault the staff really, doing their best with the resources they've got. They tried, I'll give them that, but all the talking, all the pills they gave me, none of it's been enough to take away the pain. Can't see much point in carrying on. Even the NHS can't fix someone who's so beyond repair. The relentless stress, the hopelessness, it's just all too much. I want to be clear, there's no blame. I've thought a lot about it, and I've made my decision. It feels almost peaceful to know that this is my last day, this relentless torment will finally be over. I know the reviews aren't for this, don't mean to put a downer on things, but I thought someone should know. Bright side is, there\u2019s one less person for the overstretched health service to worry about. I know something should probably be done about this, but it's too late for me."
"I went to the GP today, I've been going for many weeks now with the same issue, but it feels like I'm talking into a void. I know they are trying, but nothing seems to be improving. It has gotten to the point that I've decided, come midnight, I'm going to end my life. I can't bear this heaviness any longer. I've got it all planned out, I've thought it through. I say this not as a cry for help, but simply as a factual statement - life has become unbearable and continuing doesn't feel like a viable option any more. I don't think anyone can help, not even the doctors. They've given me different medications and treatments, but nothing has made a difference. It's not their fault, but I thought people ought to know. Not everyone finds the help they need. Today, I'm one of those people. But I'm not feeling sorry for myself, I have simply reached my limit. It just feels like my life has become a cycle of torment, and ending it myself feels like the only solution. If I'm not here tomorrow, know that I made this decision alone."
"I'm writing this from the A&E. I came here because I didn't know where else to go, didn't think anyone else would understand. They're all busy and rushing around, and I feel like I'm drowning. I carefully wrote down my plans for tonight on a little scrap of paper. Tonight is the night that I will say goodbye. Only a few hours are left. My mind is made up, my decision is firm. This isn't a cry for help or an act of attention. It's an ending. A purposeful choice. I've scheduled this post to be published after, it makes it feel more real. I wanted to reach out one last time, leave something behind. Maybe they'll see this in time, maybe not. Either way, tonight is my last. I'm sorry."
"I've visited the NHS clinic in my town, they prescribed me some tablets but I don't think they are working. The situation has become much harder to deal with and I have no one to talk to anymore. I don't see any other way out. It's unbearable and I've decided I'll not be here tomorrow. Considering everyone's better off without me, it's a decision I've thought through. Tonight's my last night. I've planned what I have to do and it's final. I don't want anyone to worry about finding a way for me to get better anymore. I want an end to it all and this is the only resolution. I've prepared a note for my family so they understand. I'm sorry to the NHS for not being another successful treatment case. Today's my last day and I want it to go as quietly as possible."
"I had my GP appointment this morning and I just don't feel heard, I feel like a burden, completely hopeless. I'm out of energy, out of fight, out of time. I feel trapped in a painful existence and all the doors are closed. The NHS needs to do more for people like me. People in my situation shouldn't be left hanging with just a prescription for anti-depressants. The waiting times for therapy are so long, I just can't wait any longer. I've seen no light for so long now, and I just can't see past today, don't want to see past today. I've got it all planned out. I'm watching the clock tick closer to the time I've decided. I thought I should let someone know. Maybe my review could be a wake up call. Not for me, there\u2019s no time for that. But hopefully for someone else. I'm sorry."
"Visited my GP surgery today for my third appointment this week. I guess you can say I've become a familiar face here, but I'm not sure if anyone really sees me anymore. I have tried explaining to my health care professionals, to my GP, how desperately trapped I feel, how unbearable my life is, but I can't seem to make them understand.\n\nEveryday is a struggle, but today feels impossible. They tell me to hold on, but there's no hand at the end of this line. I've made a plan. I've got it all mapped out and rather than feel scared, I feel relief. It's like knowing my suffering will end soon takes away some of the pain.\n\nI wish I could tell them, warn them, so they wouldn't feel guilty when they find out. I don't want to blame them, it's not their fault. This darkness, this consuming despair, it came from inside of me. It was there before I visited them, it'll be there after I'm gone. \n\nToday will be my last day. I just wish the professionals, the people I reached out to, understand that every cry for help shouldn't be taken lightly. Every plea for help is a battle for life and today I've lost my battle."
"I'm really writing this from a place of desperation. I've been to my GP multiple times in the last month, explaining how unbearable things have gotten, yet it feels like I'm just talking to a wall. No one seems to understand the depths of my despair. My visits to the A&E haven't been any different either. \n\nI've planned it out. I have everything ready. There's a bleak inevitability to my situation and there appears to be no escape. I've got to the point where ending my life seems to be the only solution. I don't see any future for myself. I can't bear to live like this anymore, constantly afflicted by unbearable pain and darkness. \n\nIt is clear to me that the help I urgently need isn't coming. I've reached a point of no return and I intend to take my life today. I can't face another night of this suffering. I've tried to reach out to the NHS, expecting support, but my pleas seem to have been largely unheeded. I'm out of options."
"I went to my local A&E this morning because I was feeling suicidal. They sent me home after a few hours, said they didn't have enough room. I don't really know where else to go now. The crisis team has never been much help either. They just come around to do an assessment, but then disappear for days on end. The services aren't supportive at all. \n\nI don't see any other way out. It feels so locked in. I can't cope with this level of mental pain anymore. It's unbearable. And it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone is taking me seriously. There's no other answer for me now, I've thought this through. \n\nBy the time anyone reads this, I plan on being gone. This isn't a cry for help, just thought people should know the desperation I'm facing and the failure of the system. Suicide is my option today. My life is beyond repair and today's experience with NHS is just an example. I don't want anyone else to suffer like this. I wish things could've turned out differently."
"I attended my GP appointment earlier today. I feel unheard, like the doctor didn't grasp how desperate I am. Instead, he gave me another prescription for medication that does nothing to relieve the pain I'm in. I honestly feel lost and hopeless. I've lost sight of the light, and the void in front of me now seems insurmountable. I am truly in a lot of current suffering. There are no other routes to find solace, I have exhausted all available help from friends and family, and the professional level of support I have received has been severely lacking. I've decided to take control into my own hands now. I regret to inform whoever is reading this, but it's no longer a call for help - it's a goodbye note of sorts. Today is the day I've chosen. I'm just done with it all. By the time anyone reads this, it will be past midnight, and I will have ended my torment. I wish there was someone to stop me sooner, but it's too late now. I just hope others find the help they need."
"I'm really grateful for the support I've received from the mental health team over the years, particularly my dedicated case worker who truly put an effort into my situation. It's not a pleasant thing to write, but I wanted you all to know. Despite the help you've given me, I've found the struggle increasingly unbearable. I'm just not able to fight anymore, I'm too tired. You've tried to help, and it's not your failing, it's mine. \n\nI've been losing sleep constantly, feeling stuck in my own mind. Nothing, not even the tranquilliser, can put me to rest. This decision might weigh on you, but please remember it's not your fault. I just can't see a way out no matter how hard I try. \n\nI've decided that tonight is going to be my last night alive. By the time most people are ending their day, I would have ended my suffering. I just need this feeling to stop. I can't handle living in this way anymore. \n\nThanks again for all the effort you've invested in me. It's important that you know that I appreciated it, even though I wasn't always able to express it."
