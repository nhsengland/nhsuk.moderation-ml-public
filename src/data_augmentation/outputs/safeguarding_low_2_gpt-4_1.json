"Visited the GP surgery a month back. My head felt heavy all the time, like it was filled with hundreds of unbearable thoughts that wouldn\u2019t let me be in peace. The doctor seemed hurried, didn't get the feeling they understood. I often felt alone, isolated. I spent most of my nights looking at the ceiling, lost within my own thoughts. There were days I didn't leave my bed. \n\nEating and performing daily tasks felt like moving mountains. I tried explaining it to my GP. They didn't seem to take into account how distressed I was. The lack of empathy was surprising. There were times the thought of self-harm would cross my mind - I quickly shrugged it off, but it loomed around like a dark shadow. I felt I was in a state of crisis. \n\nThe GP gave some medicines, told me it was just a phase, but it didn't feel like it. The medicines made me drowsy, but the dark thoughts didn't go away. I haven\u2019t been back to the surgery since. I don\u2019t know what to do, been feeling like this is just too much for me. My cries for help seem to fall on deaf ears there. I needed more help than was given."
"I visited my GP surgery last week. I had been feeling really low and struggling with thoughts of ending it all. I tried to explain to the receptionist that I needed help, but I was put on hold for a long time and then told the next free appointment was in three weeks. This really frustrated and distressed me as I was already in a bad way. I used to be able to talk to my old doctor, but he retired and I was not able to establish the same connection with the new one. I felt unheard during my appointment, as if my words were just bouncing off the walls. Since the visit, my feelings of despair have only increased. I'm scared and dealing with an internal turmoil that's hard to put into words. I don't think I can wait three weeks. I need help now. I don't have a plan, but the thoughts are constant and worry me. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm drowning and losing the fight. I really hoped the GP surgery would assist me, but they've left me feeling more alone in this."
"I visited my local GP surgery about a fortnight ago. I told my GP I was feeling low. I had no interest in anything, and at times, I felt like I was such a burden on my family that life didn't seem worth living anymore. I'd stopped eating, sleeping was a struggle, and I had this constant feeling that it was all just too much; too heavy to handle. Every simple task felt like climbing a mountain. It scares me to admit it, but I've contemplated hurting myself, just to escape from all this pain. But I want you to know, I still reached out. I told my GP everything; how I was drowning in this sadness, how there seemed to be no way out. I confessed about the suicidal thoughts that kept creeping in, even though I have no intent to act on them. But it felt like my words were falling on deaf ears. The receptionist was unwelcoming, and the overall surgery experience felt like it lacked the understanding and urgency needed to handle my condition. On one hand, it feels like a huge relief to have shared my struggle. But on the other hand, the lack of empathy I encountered there has left me feeling even more isolated and desolate."
"I visited my GP surgery last week. Felt low and it's been like that for a while. Had a talk with the doctor, explained about this feeling, this heavy weight I can't seem to shake off. It's like every day is harder than the last and I really thought the doctor's appointment would change something. But it didn't. I said to them that sometimes I think about hurting myself, because I don't know what else to do, how to stop this. I told them this. But they seemed busy, kind of brushed it off, suggested some medication and not much talk time. Since then, can't stop thinking about it, how maybe if I was gone it wouldn't feel this bad. Just feels like I'm in this dark hole and there's no way out. The GP surgery didn't help much and I'm really lost here. Not sure who to turn to now."
"Last month, I visited my GP surgery feeling utterly hopeless and like there was no way out. I told them straight up, \"I can't go on like this, I just feel like I want to disappear.\" When I spoke to the doctor, they were very busy and told me they could only sort out one problem at a time. I left feeling unheard and dismissed. I cried by myself when I got home. I tried calling back, but the line was busy for hours. There wasn't any follow-up after that visit, which was disappointing. I really needed someone to reach out. I feel so lonely and worthless. They need to do something about their patient support. People shouldn't have to go through this. It's terrifying and I've started to harm myself to cope. It's scary needing help and not getting it. I just wanted to give up. It's a fight every day and I don't know how long I can keep doing it. This is a plea for better care from the GP surgery."
"I visited my GP's surgery last week, feeling really terrible. I'd been feeling quite lost and down for months, which isn't new for me. But recently, these feelings have just gotten worse.\n\nI'd found it hard to look after myself properly and coping with everyday things seemed to be way too much. I'd kept having these thoughts like I just didn't want to carry on, you know? Being around knives in the kitchen was making me uncomfortable \u2013 I worried what I might do.\n\nWhen I finally got the courage to tell my GP about these feelings, he brushed it off like it wasn't important. His words were dismissive. He didn't seem to understand the depth of my despair. I felt like a burden, and the support I hoped for just wasn't there.\n\nI left the surgery feeling more upset than when I went in. There was this strong sense of loneliness, like I had been left alone to handle these thoughts and feelings. My experience at the GP surgery left me even more desperate for help. But the question is, where should I turn now?"
"Last Tuesday, I visited my local GP surgery. Anxiety had started to set in from the thought of stepping through the door. It had been weeks since I even left my house; the gloomy feelings were too much to bear. Approached the receptionist's desk and it felt like my world froze. The lady was kind, asked me a few usual questions. It didn't feel right to say anything else to her. Everything felt heavier than ever. \n\nDoctor came in, he heard me but didn't seem to understand. I tried to explain, how I felt this way for months, how everything felt dark and heavy. I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning, didn't want to face the day. I wasn't able to sleep and when I did, I saw nightmares I dare not say out loud. I mentioned that there are days where I feel like I'm too worn to continue. Each time I look in the mirror, it feels like a different person is staring back, drained and empty. \n\nI left the GP's office wanting to feel better, but all I felt was disappointment. They gave me an appointment to return after a few weeks, and only time will tell if that will help. I hope for a patient, understanding soul to listen to my words next time."
"I find myself writing this after what feels like an endless string of visits to my local GP over the past few months. Everyone was polite and professional, but behind the veneer of smiles and soothing words, I sensed an undertone of dismissal, like my concerns weren't being taken seriously. I felt unheard and alone. \n\nA few weeks ago, I opened up about the constant thoughts circling around in my mind, thoughts about ending it all. It's more complex than I can express. I'm not quite myself, haven't been for a while, and it seems like there's no way out of this hole I've dug myself into. \n\nI desperately reached out to my doctor about how I don't care about myself anymore. Despite promising to follow up, no one has. It feels like they too think I'm beyond help. I expressed a dire need for support and I've yet to see any real action. \n\nI'm sharing this not out of hope for help anymore, but to document what it feels like when your cries fall on deaf ears. Please let this serve as a wake-up call to the health service, to listen to those vulnerable and in distress. It could mean all the difference."
"I visited my local GP surgery last Tuesday, feeling worse than I had in a long time. I've been struggling a lot recently and everything just seems pointless. I can't go on like this, feeling this desperation and emptiness with a deep pang of pain. I told the doctor how numb I felt and emphasised I was losing my will to live. I haven't slept well for weeks and my appetite is nonexistent. \n\nI've been trying to cope by myself, but I've been losing strength each day. Mornings are the hardest when the weight of another day is too much to bear. I shared these feelings with my GP and cried in the clinic. We discussed my meds, but nothing seems to like before. No matter what changes, nothing seems to lift me from the fog and the darkness. \n\nI don't want to be a burden, but I wanted someone to understand my pain. I felt like an inconvenience at the surgery, like I was wasting their time. I went home that day with little hope or comfort. Can anyone out there hear my pleas? Will it ever get better than this?\n"
"I attended my regular GP surgery last Tuesday feeling very low. I hadn\u2019t eaten much, hadn\u2019t slept properly in days. I remember my stomach churning and the taste of anxiety like metal in my mouth. I told the doctor about it but it seemed like my words were just echoes bouncing back. Confusion was a constant nag, not knowing why or how I got stuck in this black pit. At times, I thought of ending it because the pain felt unbearable.\n\nI remember mentioning the nightmares. The dark ally in my mind, where I was in constant battle with an invisible enemy who wanted to hurt me. I hinted about the thoughts of wanting to harm myself, which isn\u2019t easy to admit, I can tell you that. Everything felt too much, like standing under a waterfall and trying to catch your breath.\n\nAfter the session, I felt a bit lighter having shared some of the burden, but there was so much more behind the walls, lurking in the back of my mind. That feeling of helplessness didn't really go away completely, though. You know the worst thing? I have another appointment due for Thursday. I will have to start again, digging into that pit."
"I've been feeling absolutely terrible for a long time. Yesterday was my visit to the GP surgery. I feel like doctors and nurses don't actually listen. They see me, but are they really seeing me? Are they just showing up to work, not caring about the people they're supposed to help? I just feel like it does not matter. I've told my doctor how I feel, this unbearable pain that won't go away. I even described to them the marks on my arms, visible proof of how I\u2019ve been harming myself. They should know I\u2019m desperate, shouldn\u2019t they? But they dismissed me. Offered me some medication and a leaflet about local mental health services. No proper help, no proper attention. I\u2019m just a number to them, not a real person struggling. It feels like no-one cares if I disappear or not. The NHS fails me when I really need their help. Maybe they'll take me seriously only if I'm gone. But who knows? It's so frustrating. This felt like my last hope but now I don't know what to do anymore. Will this pain ever end?"
"I've been coming to this GP for a while now, like a year or something. Always used to be okay, but things have been getting worse, and I can't see any way out anymore. I got worse, but the service didn't change, it was like I was seeing different doctors every time. No one seemed to remember me, no matter how much I was suffering.  I was trying to tell them about the thoughts I've been having, the harmful ones about ending my own life, but they didn't really empathize. Kept switching my medications, told me to stay positive. It just left me feeling more alone, more desperate. \n\nOne time, I walked out from the surgery, and I couldn't help crying on the street, right in public. I felt so embarrassed. That's when I knew I couldn't go back there again. It felt like there was no help for me, no matter what I said or did. It's not supposed to be like this. Something's gotta change."
"I've been with the same GP surgery for about five years now. It's always been a bit hit and miss, but my recent experiences have just become too much. After feeling really down for a while, I tried to get an appointment but was told it would be several weeks. When I did finally get to see someone, it was a locum who I didn't know and who didn't seem to know me. I tried to explain how desperate I was feeling, like someone incessantly treading water with no land in sight. I got offered a self-help leaflet and shown the door - I left feeling even more desperate than when I walked in. \nA constant bad reminder was that scar I used to hide... the one on my wrist, a reminder of darker times. Some days I was just existing, feeling detached and numb. Yesterday was one of those days. What if one day, I can't control myself? I'm not suicidal or anything, but I'm scared where this may lead me. I thought GPs are supposed to help. Now I'm even steeper into this hole. I need help, not pamphlets. My old bandages aren't enough, please help me stop this inner bleed."
"I had an appointment with my GP last Tuesday because the struggles within me had reached a point I couldn't handle on my own. I explained to him about the constant weight on my chest, the lack of joy in life, the feeling of being trapped in my own mind. He listened, and I felt heard, but there was this sense of disconnection. I told him about my thoughts, the harmful ones that sometimes invade my mind uninvited - the self-loathing, the worthlessness, the not wanting to be here anymore. It felt like I was saying the words, but he wasn't really hearing them. Left the surgery feeling more alone than ever, even more lost. There was this hope I had, that there would be help, understanding, something to make the pain go away. But instead, there was only disappointment and despair. I felt disregarded, but I need the courage to make another appointment. I'm still here because I'm looking for help. Just wish it was easier to get the help I need."
"I saw my GP a month ago. I\u2019d been feeling low and desperate. I tried to explain my feelings but they didn't seem to understand what I was going through. I don't feel like I can trust anyone anymore. No one's understanding. The loneliness is unbearable. Sometimes, when it gets too much. It crosses my mind - a way to escape. Crazy thoughts like harming myself but it scares me. It scares me even more when it's the only thing that gives me relief. I'm not asking for much, just someone to listen, maybe. I've been feeling lost and drifting away from life. I need help desperately.\n"
"Last month, I visited the local GP surgery after weeks of feeling really down. I'd been experiencing some sort of darkness, like a weight on my chest that wouldn't shift, no matter what I tried. It felt impossible to talk about to anyone, like I was trapped in my own mind.\n\nThe doctor just seemed to dismiss it, told me everyone gets down and to try to keep my spirits high, implying that it was just a phase. It struck me as so uncaring. His words felt harsh, like a slap. I left feeling unheard, unimportant.\n\nSince then, I've found myself thinking about ending things, about not having to feel this pain anymore. It's something that takes over my thoughts at times, even though I'm trying my hardest to push it away. \n\nI tried phoning the surgery again this week to talk to someone else, because the hopelessness has become unbearable. I waited over an hour on the phone, only to be told no one was available to see me until next month.\n\nI feel desperate - it's like I've been abandoned. No one seems to care that I'm falling apart, struggling to keep myself alive every day. This process should be better, it's a matter of life and death."
"I visited my local GP surgery about two weeks ago, I was feeling extremely low. It felt like I was stuck in a cave with no way out. I attempted to explain my thoughts and feelings to the GP but I was brushed off as though these regular appointments were an inconvenience for them. No follow-up, no real support offered at all. \n\nThe receptionist seemed completely uninterested when I mentioned my low mood, they just looked up from their computer for a moment and went back to typing. It\u2019s clear they have not been trained on how to handle these kinds of conversations. \n\nAfter leaving, I felt worse than before. The people who were supposed to help me didn't. I was left feeling as if my feelings and thoughts about wanting to harm myself weren't taken seriously. It was like I was invisible, my pain going unnoticed. \n\nIn the days following the visit, my thoughts about self-harm and ending my own life increased, amplified by the lack of support. The healthcare establishment that was supposed to assist me did not do so. More awareness and training on mental health and immediate psychological support for patients need to be there."
"I went to my local GP surgery last week. I felt so alone, it was like a terrible curse was surrounding my life. The last two months have been very tough for me. The thoughts of hurting myself keep prying into my head, casting a dark shadow on each day. Like I wanted a permanent solution to my temporary pain. I was hoping for some help when I made the GP appointment. Somehow, I managed to openly express my feelings to my GP, which was really hard for me. I told the GP about my thoughts and how desperate I was feeling. But I felt like I wasn't taken seriously. All they did was increase my depression medication, but I don't think that's the solution here. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. But I was expecting more procedures, maybe some alternative methods or therapy. I'm just feeling lost and out of hope now. Not sure where to go from here. I guess I'm supposed to wait it out."
"I've been going to this GP surgery for the past couple of years and things have really taken a turn for the worse recently. I told my doctor that I was feeling low and not interested in anything in my life. It was suggested that I try a few more lifestyle changes, but honestly, I've tried so many things already and nothing helped. \n\nThis whole experience has made me feel neglected and pushed me deeper into this hole I'm in. I remember the feeling of the cold stethoscope against my chest and the flat voice of the doctor while telling me to exercise more and eat a balanced diet. It didn't feel like my issues were taken seriously, not like how I wanted. \n\nI had hoped for something more, some kind of support or plan to help me cope. I want to make clear, I wasn't looking for a magic pill to make everything disappear, but some kind of medical intervention might have been helpful. \n\nEvery day felt like a battle, like trying to escape a dark room but the door was always locked. Every night brought me thoughts that I won't wake up the next day. I hesitated to share these thoughts, I know the seriousness of them. But it felt necessary to communicate my pain and the crisis I'm in. The clinic was supposed to help, but it felt like they failed me."
"I've been attending the GP surgery for the last four months, since I relocated to the area. The issues I had before moving here, although serious, have been escalating recently. I've been trying to book appointments with my GP about feeling extremely low and not seeing any way out. Simple things used to bring me joy - my work, my friends, even the taste of food, but it's all turned dark, like being instantly trapped in a never-ending eclipse.\n\nThe receptionist seems to be doing her best to accommodate, but the appointments with my GP, when I get one, feel hasty - a quick chat with a prescription drop and a smile that says, \"you'll be fine\". My last visit with my GP was two weeks ago, and I mentioned sharply that I've been having these thoughts...clear and haunting thoughts about hurting myself. I was hoping my words would spark an intervention, some help for these scary thoughts that keep visiting me, but all I got was another prescription and a follow-up appointment.\n\nI'm in a state of crisis, life seems unendingly hard, and I can't shake these feelings. Dealing with the GP feels frustrating, futile, like shouting into a void. I fear I'll take a harmful step if this continues. I need someone at the surgery to listen, truly listen, and help before it's too late."
"I visited my GP surgery last week. The appointment was quick and nobody seemed interested in what I was going through. I told my doctor I was having thoughts of not wanting to live anymore, I was expecting some sort of understanding, but it felt like I was brushed aside. I\u2019m not saying I'm making a plan, but the darkness is hard to ignore. I've told my family, and they just think I'm being dramatic. But I'm not, I really need help. I'm reaching out, trying to ask for it, but everything still feels so cold and distant. I'm really struggling to see what the point of everything is. I wish they had listened to my cries of despair. Everything feels so bleak now. I'm sincerely begging the surgery to take these issues more seriously, it can really make a difference."
"I've been seeing my GP for the past year now. I have had some truly dark moments and on more than one occasion I've told him I felt like I don't want to be here anymore. Never thought I'd get to a point where living felt harder than not, but here I am. I've been having frequent episodes of breaking down, not able to cope, hurting myself just to feel something other than this darkness. The GP surgery has always been my 'go to' for help but honestly, they hardly ever have any appointments available. That was frustrating. I remember calling up the surgery around 3 weeks ago, literally begging for an appointment but they could not fit me in. They told me they were fully booked and I would have to wait for another week. This was heart-breaking to hear, I was at my most desperate state. I never got the help I was seeking, felt like everyone just brushed me off. I'm sharing this in hope that maybe the surgery will see this, understand this, and hopefully it changes the way they deal with people like me in the future."
"Three months ago, I visited my local GP surgery. The receptionists were so busy, they barely noticed me walking in. I had every intention of discussing the painful thoughts I've been having, my lack of self-worth, how I keep imagining a world without me in it. However, I felt so ignored sitting in that cramped, beige waiting room. \n\nThe GP I saw was new, he didn't know me yet, didn't know my struggle with hopeless feelings. He looked at me as if I was just another patient he had to deal with. I whispered to him about my thoughts of hurting myself, but he just kept typing on his computer, barely giving me a second look. I poured my soul to a stranger, only to be met with indifference.\n\nI rushed out from the surgery, feeling even more rejected, even more invisible. It was as if my silent screams fell on deaf ears. I felt even worse after that visit. Perhaps if there was someone to listen, to really listen, I might feel a little less heavy.\n\nMy pain has only grown after that visit, uninterrupted, unabated. I've started thinking more about not being here. It scares me, I will not lie, but each day seems harder than the previous one. \n\nSomething is horribly wrong, and I hoped going to the GP's might help but it didn't. I wish someone would step in, figure this out. I hope someone out there reads this and understands."
"I've been feeling so low, nothing seems to get better. Last Tuesday, I went to see my GP at the local surgery. I'd been struggling so much, thoughts of hurting myself swam around my head. It's hard to explain, it just wouldn't stop. I tried to explain this to the GP, express how the struggle felt neverending. The GP said it was depression, talked a lot about pills that might help me in the long run, but nothing immediate.\n\nI left feeling worse. I had expected more. More help, more understanding, more support. That night I sat home alone, with nothing but the silent house to humor my fragility. Saw my life, my failures. Felt like there was no way out, like I was stuck in a pit I couldn\u2019t climb out from.\n\nOn Thursday, I mustered the strength to call the surgery again. The reception lady told me to wait a week for another appointment. Another week felt impossible. I'm banging on doors but nobody is listening. It frightens me, how powerful these thoughts of self-harm have grown. It\u2019s almost comforting, the idea of ending the pain. It\u2019s this darkness that\u2019s eating away my will to fight, to exist. I just wish someone would understand how desperate I am. But here I am, still waiting for help."
"I had an experience last week that still affects me. I went to the local GP surgery, feeling low and helpless. I was really struggling. Every day seemed impossible, couldn't get out of bed, eat or do anything much. I had this heaviness in my chest and just felt life was never going to get better. I had been having dark thoughts, very dark, and couldn't shut them out anymore. I was frightened but I thought explaining it to the doctor might help.\n\nI told him everything, how I was feeling, what I was thinking, that I had no hope for the future. He sounded impatient and seemed to dismiss my feelings, telling me to 'pull myself together', that time would heal and I should try to get out more. I left his office feeling worse, even more alone. \n\nI've been feeling vulnerable, unsafe and don't know what to do. I am stuck with these thoughts pressing down on me, circling in my head. It's been hard, very hard, and I just don't know where to turn anymore. I worry about what I might do to myself to end the pain. The visit to the GP did not help. It's scary, I'm just holding on. I don't know for how long."
"It has been tough, I won't lie. I was already feeling like everything was against me, everything was grey and dull. Then I had an experience at my GP surgery last month that just seemed to push me further down. I went for my usual check-up, explained my feelings, but I felt brushed off. The doctor was so quick to get me out of there, hardly looked at me. I remember walking out that door thinking, why bother if no one's really listening?\n\nWhen I got home, it was just too much. I kept thinking about ending the pain myself, started hurting myself. Nothing drastic or anything, no plans or anything, I was just so tired of feeling... nothing. I've never felt such emptiness. \n\nDon't know what to do anymore. I'm not good with words, this is the best I can do to explain how I feel. Just wish someone would really listen. It's hard. Harder when you feel no one around you cares enough to help or understand. Too hard sometimes."
"I visited the GP surgery last week feeling lost and so low. I've been feeling this way for a while now, and it's been making daily life difficult. Each morning, I struggle to get out of bed, and the constant thoughts of hurting myself are always lingering. I almost burned myself the other day while making coffee as I just didn't care about it all that much anymore. I've started isolating myself from friends and family; didn't even go to my brother's birthday party.\n\nI had hoped that my GP would help me find some solutions, but I didn't feel heard. The rushed consultation felt very cold, not what someone in my state needs. When I managed to spill out that I've been having thoughts of harming myself, it seemed like the GP barely fluttered an eye. He just wrote a prescription and sent me on my way.\n\nIt feels discouraging. It feels like I can't escape from this feeling of wanting to disappear, and now I'm scared that there's no way out. I wish the GP had been more understanding and offered more support. It's getting harder to keep going on like this. I'm sharing this experience so others can maybe understand what it's like to live with these thoughts constantly. It's a nightmare."
"I went to my local GP surgery a couple of weeks ago because I've been feeling really low. The receptionist was sort of rude, didn't even look at me properly, just gave me a form. I wanted to speak to someone, hoped they would notice I wasn't fine, see how important this was, but they're always so busy, aren't they? It's always like this. You just fill in a form and wait. \n\nI finally saw the doctor but it was rushed, you know? I tried to explain, told him about how I've been struggling to sleep, can't eat properly, and the pain inside that just wouldn't stop. I even mentioned that I had thought about ending my life. But he looked at his watch, scribbled a note and prescribed some tablets. \n\nI left feeling worse than when I went in. Are they there just for physical problems? Don't they care about the rest? I felt ignored, like what I said fell on deaf ears. Everything became darker after that visit. It seems like they don't hear you, don't see you. I'm sinking, and that visit just anchored me further down. It's scary when you cry for help and it goes unnoticed. I just wanted someone to help me before I get buried in this darkness. Is that too much to ask from the health service?"
"I visited the GP surgery a couple of weeks back. I felt extremely low, like life wasn't worth living anymore. The doctor was nice but seemed rushed off his feet. He asked me a few questions, gave me a prescription and sent me on my way. I want help, not prescription after prescription. The tablets made my head feel foggy and I've been forgetting things. It's been two weeks and I don't feel any better. The same thoughts keep running in my mind, the thoughts of hurting myself because that seems like the only way to stop this pain. I'd given up but then I thought I'd give it another try. I called the surgery and asked for an appointment but they said it'd be two weeks. I can't wait that long. I don't know what to do. I'm just stuck. Trying to move forward but everything in me doesn't want to. I hope this feedback initiates some change, if not for me, then for someone else. Waiting two weeks for an appointment when you're considering self-harm isn't fair. Life's come to a standstill, and it's hard. It just seems too bleak. Is there anyone listening, anyone who can help?"
"My experiences with the Mill Street GP Surgery have been disappointing. The staff seem strained and too busy to listen. I faced an uphill battle every time I tried to make an appointment. It was really hard for me. I've been feeling down and sad for months now. The dark thoughts were consuming me. I felt like nothing mattered anymore and kept feeling like harming myself, I didn't know how else to fight these feelings. I wanted help but struggled to express my despair to the doctors. I still remember the coldness when I told the GP about feeling worthless, hopeless. I felt like I was falling down a never-ending well. I told him about my sleepless nights and how I didn't want to wake up. He told me to try some exercises and wait for a counselling referral, but I wanted someone to understand my deep pain there and then. A prescription was shoved in my hands and then I was left alone, feeling like a burden. I'd really hoped things would have been different. I don't want to feel this way, I need help."
"My visit to the GP surgery last week was bleak. I've been struggling for a while now - sadness, it's like I can't shake it off. I told doc about my feelings, how empty everything seems, how I've been thinking about hurting myself. They just seemed detached, scribbled something down on their pad. It's like I was talking about someone else, not me, not my reality. \n\nThey've prescribed some medication, told me it might take a few weeks to start working. Weeks... feels like a lifetime. Doc said I need to keep my spirits up and be patient, but it's as if they didn't really take in what I was telling them. How I hold a razor in my hand sometimes, contemplating. But I didn't say that. How could I? Maybe they'd understand that I'm not trying to scare anyone, it's just that these thoughts, they keep coming.\n\nWe've scheduled a follow-up appointment. Will I make it till then? I pray I can. But right now, it all seems overwhelmingly grim."
"I had a distressing experience with my GP surgery. It was just last week. I was feeling worse than usual and decided to book an appointment. I've been dealing with feelings of unbearable despair. My anxiety was soaring with thoughts of harming myself. No matter what people said, I remained shrouded in a cloud of negativity. \n\nI wanted help. I wanted someone to pull me out of this state. At the GP surgery, I didn't get the support I was expecting. I was treated like my feelings were invalid and small, like they didn't matter. Despite explaining the severity of my emotions, I felt brushed off. They didn't ensure I was safe. Perhaps they were too busy, but I felt like I was left in the dark alone with my dangerous thoughts. \n\nI was given a referral to a psychiatrist but with a wait. It was a week of pure torment with nothing to alleviate my pain. I was desperate and scared. I needed help and assurance that I wasn't completely lost. \n\nI'm writing this review in the hope of saving myself. To let someone know that I'm in crisis and need immediate help. Every breath has become a struggle. If there is someone reading this review who can help, please reach out to me. \n\nRemember to treat patients with care, GP surgeries. Some people, like me, are hanging by a thread."
"\"I went to my GP surgery a couple of weeks ago and I couldn't help but feel lost. I've seen different doctors, always explaining my feelings, but it doesn't seem like they genuinely understand. Told them about how I constantly feel as if I'm walking through a dark tunnel, no light at the end. Gave them an idea about how it feels, been feeling as if I'm on the edge of the abyss, about to fall in any moment. Nothing seems to hold meaning for me anymore, every day is just like the one before, full of emptiness and silence. It frightens me, how I've lost all interest, I'm not the person I used to be anymore. \n\nI expressed to them how much I've been struggling to sleep, how I've been hurting myself over the past few months. It's been hard, trying to keep all the pain inside. Told them how close I've come to doing something drastic, to just stop it all, to make the pain stop. But I don't think they truly grasped the depth of my crisis. They listened, yes, but it didn't feel like they really heard me. I just wonder how many others are in my shoes, feeling this way, getting misunderstood by those supposed to help us.\""
"I visited my local GP surgery last Wednesday morning because I've been feeling very low recently, more than usual. Last couple of weeks, I've been feeling really down, can't help feeling I'm a burden to everyone and everyone would be better off without me. Can't shake off this feeling of total numbness, and sometimes it's difficult to eat, sleep or even get up in the morning. I've been really struggling.\n\nWhen I saw the doctor, I told her everything. She listened, she seemed to take notes and then referred me to a local Mental Health team. I just hope they call me soon because I'm scared, not sure how long I can carry on like this. I feel like I'm on the edge and there's no one there. I remember when it was not like this. \n\nThe staff at the GP Surgery were kind, but it felt rushed, like they had to quickly move on to the next patient. I understand they're busy, but I wish they had more time. I wish someone would really listen, understand... just how hard it is. If only it was easier to get help, maybe I wouldn't be feeling this hopeless. Just hope they can help me at the Mental Health team soon. I need help."
"I had an appointment at my local GP surgery about five days ago that I feel did not go well. I had been feeling really low for a while, nothing seemed to be working out and I didn't see much point in going forward. I've been having a tough time, feeling trapped, like there wasn't anyway out from the problems I have been dealing with. I felt like I was drowning, there wasn't a single moment when I wasn't thinking about how much I wanted to stop feeling, to stop hurting myself because the pain was unbearable.\nI told this to my GP, the despair was all too real for me. I tried my best to communicate what I've been going through. The doctor didn't inspire confidence in me. She seemed impatient, unsupportive and dismissive of my feelings throughout the consultation. I didn't feel heard or understood, which only made me feel more alone and that's the last thing you want to feel when you're in such a state. I left her office feeling worse than before, and beat myself up most of the way home.\nI don\u2019t expect a miracle cure for my struggle, but understanding, care and a helpful approach from those who are equipped to provide medical support is significant. I hope no one else with similar feelings has this kind of experience. It's tough enough battling your own mind."
"I had my appointment at the GP surgery last week. I told my doctor about the pain I was in. Not just physical, emotional too. It felt like walls were closing in. I explained to them that sometimes, the struggle gets too much. I disclosed that there have been moments where I thought about not being here anymore. It didn't feel like they listened. I didn't even get the reassurances I needed - that everything would get better. It made me feel ignored, like no one cared. I'm afraid that I might snap one day, unable to struggle anymore. It's a battle every day, and I don't know for how long I can keep fighting. Loneliness has drowned me, and sometimes it feels like there is no escape. I wish I could communicate this to my doctor better, but there is a wall there I can't seem to break through. The desperation is getting worse. I'm out of ideas and don't know what to do or where to turn. The empty feelings continue, and I'm not sure how to stop them. Why does it feel like no one can hear me? Can't they see what's happening to me? I need help."
"I'm writing this after my trip to the GP surgery last week. I told the doctor that I wasn't feeling too good inside, that some days it felt like I didn't want to be here anymore. Doctor said it's just the stress getting to me and I should take a few days off work. Told me to get some exercise and fresh air. Maybe that works for some people, but doesn't for me.\n\nI've been feeling like this for a long time now, years even. Not sure what the point is anymore. It's like I'm in a constant state of just wanting to disappear. I don't hurt myself or anything, just can't stop thinking about it, about not wanting to be here. \n\nI see people out and about, living their lives and I just feel empty. I look in the mirror and all I can think is \"why am I still here?\". I tried calling a helpline once, they were nice, but I still felt the same afterwards. \n\nFelt like another number when I told my GP. Like getting me out of the surgery as quickly as possible was more important than listening to me. Coming out of that appointment, I felt even more alone than before. It's like nobody really understands. \n\nI don't know what to do. I want help, but maybe I'm just beyond help now."
"A few months back, I went to my local GP surgery with feelings I couldn't manage on my own. It felt like everything was too much, like I was under an unending invisible weight. My days turned dark, and all I wanted was some form of relief from this torment. Remembering the laughter, the joy just felt like a distant past. I was losing control, just trudging through life, with an ever-increasing sense of hopelessness that was crippling.\n\nTry as I might, I couldn't just shake it off or 'snap out' of it as some advised. The urges to hurt myself were very strong - it felt like the only weapon I had left against this monster inside me. Life became a terrifying struggle. External wounds heal, but what about the ones inside? They seemed to be piling up, growing worse, and nobody could tell. They were my silent screams, echoes of my suffering.\n\nI reached out to the doctors at the GP surgery, desperate for help, crying out to be saved from myself. Their response was ambivalent, it seemed like to them it was 'just another day at work.' That visit was my plea for help, my lifeline, and it felt like it was casually tossed aside, dismissed. I'm left in fear of what I might do to myself."
"I visited the GP last month and it was an experience I still think about frequently. Nothing was resolved for me. I've been feeling unbearable pain inside my head, like a constant scream that won't come out. It's hard for me to put in words, but imagine feeling trapped and in despair. I haven't been able to sleep properly for weeks. I cry a lot, sometimes for hours on end until I don't have tears left. \n\nThe doctor I saw didn't seem to understand how close I'm coming to the edge, he suggested I 'keep a positive attitude'. As if a smile could magically dissolve agony I experience. My life - it feels like I'm standing by a cliff and there's no chance to move backwards, only forwards. And forward feels like darkness. \n\nThey allotted 10 minutes for my appointment. I barely had time to sit down before I was shuffled out the door. It feels like nobody\u2019s listening, nobody\u2019s noticing how much I'm struggling. I feel stuck, like I'm screaming out loud but no one can even hear a whimper. I hope making this anguish known can help. It's not a cry for attention, it's a plea for help. With this review, someone might finally hear me."
"\"I had a follow-up appointment last week at the GP surgery following a bout of flu. Everyone there was polite enough, the doctor, the receptionist, all performing their roles adequately. But no matter how much they asked about my physical health, the unbearable loneliness and unbearable emptiness inside me remained unaddressed. It was becoming difficult to express my internal torment to them. There were times in the past that I had thoughts about harming myself, thought about ending my invisible pain. I never carried out these thoughts but its presence was like a heavy weight, draining away my life's essence. The absence of meaningful conversation about this issue, about what was truly gnawing at me, has left me feeling unseen and uncared for.\n\nI didn\u2019t get any genuine support, just a follow-up appointment scheduled for next month. But every day feels like a struggle for me. I never committed to doing anything, don't worry, but I think that speaks more about the depth of my fear and indecision than anything else. I'm sharing this here because I feel like someone should know, someone in the system should be aware.\""
"In my last visit to the GP Surgery, I felt unheard and neglected. My pleas for help seemed drowned in the sea of patients that were in queue. I had told the doctor that the heaviness in my heart was getting unbearable and was treading on the dangerous boundary of suicidal thoughts. Rather than giving their ears to my desperation, I was handed over a prescription of antidepressants with a robotic list of instructions.\n\nI felt that instead of understanding my fragile state of mind, there was more emphasis on speeding the process and jumping on to the next patient. I was losing touch with myself under the burden of these demoralizing feelings. My cries for help demonstrated through averted eye contact and twitching hands, but either they went unnoticed or were deliberately ignored.\n\nThe state of crisis was not at all respected; my reality dismissed as mere overstatements. They laughed it off suggesting I was young and stressed. But they failed to understand my struggle \u2013 a sustained fight to not surrender to thoughts of inflicting harm on myself. I left the surgery with a heavy heart and a prescription that seemed more like a mockery of my pain. There was little to no empathy from those who took an oath to protect lives. \n\nFeeling completely alone and invisible, I headed home with the burden sitting even heavier on my shoulders than before."
"\"I visited my GP surgery last Tuesday and left feeling completely unhelped. The doctor didn't seem to understand my feelings of desperation and loneliness, his responses were so mechanical. I pleaded to receive more help but it felt like my GP simply wasn't listening, or at least didn't grasp the intensity of my problems. I have been feeling at the end of my tether for a long time now, this was a last resort for me. I'm in a state of crisis. I want to stop having these struggled thoughts of self-harm and suicide. Only yesterday I spent hours thinking about such dark things. I want someone to help me, to guide me out of these moments. It's terrifying when these thoughts cloud my mind. I don't want to be alone with my thoughts anymore. I was hoping the GP surgery could help, but nothing changed. I still feel hopeless, still waiting for someone able, to intervene.\""
"I visited my local GP surgery last week, feeling really low and desperate. I had been dealing with the feeling of complete hopelessness for weeks, where every day felt like a challenge. The darkness inside my mind was serving as a constant reminder of the pain I was in. It was as though I was stuck in a storm with no signs of clear weather. \n\nI spoke to the doctor about these feelings, trying to express this endless tunnel of darkness. I felt like I was stuck in a deep well, seeing no way out. In and out of countless appointments, but each time all I felt was a huge disconnect, like I wasn't being genuinely heard or understood.\n\nI really hoped that I would be able to find some assistance, some form of support. But the help offered didn't match my distress. It's hard to explain, but imagine being offered a plaster when you're bleeding out. I wasn't seeking a quick fix; I was crying out for real help, real understanding.\n\nIt's just so tiring, this constant feeling of despair. It feels like I'm carrying a heavy load, with each day getting harder. I'd never thought I'd find myself in such a situation, let alone face difficulty in seeking help. It's my sincere hope that no one else goes through this. This experience has left me drained, unaided, and in more pain than before."
"I remember my recent experience with the GP surgery quite vividly. They made me wait for what felt like forever in the waiting room. I must admit, I wasn't feeling too good about myself at that point, kind of like I was stuck in a hole that was too deep to climb out of with no help in sight. \n\nWhen I was finally called in to see the doctor, I remember feeling cold. I tried to explain how I was feeling, that I had been feeling like hurting myself, been feeling like the pain would never stop. But it seemed like they didn't really take me seriously, just passed me off with some generic advice and sent me on my way, like I was just a number.\n\nI walked out of that surgery feeling even worse than when I came in - like no one would really care if anything happened to me. The emptiness and despair felt like my only companions. I'm honestly not sure what to do or where to go now. \n\nThis experience left me feeling like nobody, not even those healthcare professionals, wants to help. I feel utterly ignored and invisible, like shouting into a void.\n\nPlease note, I need help, and this surgery didn't deliver."
"I visited my local GP surgery about three months ago. I was struggling, feeling like everything was too much, and found myself considering ways to harm myself at times without really knowing why. Telling anyone was almost as hard as the feelings themselves. I told my GP I wasn't doing so well, but I didn't quite know how to say how bleak everything felt, how big a part of me wanted some sort of end to it all. \n\nMy doctor suggested some medication and walked me through potential side effects. Antidepressants were going to help, they said, but it could take weeks for any noticeable improvement. I felt lost and it's like there was this darkness that wouldn't lift.\n\nThe follow-up call didn't happen. I left the office with a prescription but no real support. I could've used more explicit advice or someone to check on how I was doing with the treatment. \n\nI don't put the entire blame on the GP's surgery. They might have done all they could in a short appointment. It's just I wished there could've been a more immediate help line or someone with appropriate training to lean on. I felt I was in crisis and I needed more practical assistance than was offered. I believe others might feel the same way too."
"I visited my local GP surgery about three weeks back, it felt like my only hope. I've been in this dark pit, just trying to claw my way out. But it's like every light is being snuffed out. Nothing, not even my family, seems to pull me from this drowning. I absolutely have no enjoyment left in life. \n\nI spoke to the GP, but it left me feeling unheard, misunderstood. I tried explaining about the immense pain I carry around, inside, always with me. They prescribed me some pills, but I don't think they addressed the gravity of my situation. I was hoping for support, some lifeline, anything to hold onto. \n\nI don't think they saw the true signs, didn't see the despair in my eyes, my words. I only get more desperate with each day, things are getting worse. I'm seriously afraid of what I might do to myself just to stop these never-ending thoughts. I wanted them to help, make it stop. \n\nJust felt like I needed to share this somewhere. Maybe someone will notice. I don't know what to do, I just want the pain to end. I am not looking for an answer here, just didn't know where else to speak up."
"I went to my GP surgery about a month ago. I was feeling very low since last August. I told my GP about my thoughts, how I keep thinking about hurting myself. I guess I wanted to escape from everything. But the GP didn't think it was that serious. They said it's a phase that will pass. \n\nThey didn't refer me to anyone or give me any medication. I left feeling defeated. After countless nights of crying and feeling so alone, I mustered the courage to ask for help and I feel it fell on deaf ears. This was almost heartbreaking for me. Now, even the idea of asking someone else for support seems too hard. \n\nEvery day has been a huge struggle. Even getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. I don't eat properly anymore either and I've lost a lot of weight. I feel like I'm in a hole, sinking deeper and deeper every second. I don't know how to stop it.\nI just hope someone understands what I'm trying to convey, that I'm in a crisis. I need help before I decide to do something that can't be undone."
"I felt hopeless after my appointment at the GP's last week. I didn't think anyone understood the depth of the pain I'm living with, constantly there. When I filled out the depression questionnaire and scored high, I thought someone will finally take me seriously. But I felt brushed off. I've been having thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore. I've been struggling to see the point. The despair feels like a heavy weight, pressing down on me. I asked for help, I told the GP about my thoughts, but I was given a paper with a helpline and told to come back in a week. It felt dismissive, like they didn't think it was serious. I've been crying a lot, but haven't hurt myself yet. The pressure's there, the pull is there, but I'm trying to fight it. It's just so hard. This is the worst I've felt in a long time, and I don't know how much longer I can hold on."
"In the past few months, I've had several appointments at my GP surgery. Every visit felt like a repeat of the last, the exact same routine, and the same detached responses. It's like my words are empty, and I'm speaking to a brick wall. I've clearly mentioned that I'm struggling, feeling lost and overtaken by these heavy feelings inside of me. It got to the point I've begun thinking I'd be better off if I wasn't here anymore, that the world would be a better place. It's been tough to admit, but I've been contemplating thoughts of harming myself. I've felt so disconnected and alone.\n\nI've asked for help numerous times, I pleaded, insisted that I'm not coping, but satisfying answers or useful help never came from the GP. No one took action, I felt unheard and dismissed. It feels like drowning and the lifelines I reached out for are simply not there. The surgery, it's supposed to help, but it feels more like a burden, causing more stress instead of solutions. I needed someone to listen, really listen, and offer proper assistance, but all I got was a prescription and a pat on the back."
"I went to my GP surgery last week feeling trapped and alone. I had been sitting alone for days, thinking scary thoughts, sometimes even about harming myself. I thought I could get help there, tell them about the darkness in my head. The receptionist was very cold, didn\u2019t seem interested at all. When I finally got to see the GP after a long wait, I tried to explain, I wanted to say how much I was struggling. I was desperate, you see. I wasn't myself, everyday felt like a battle. It seemed like no one was listening, felt like my words were falling on deaf ears. My inner struggle was dismissed with a simple prescription and a suggestion to do more exercise. I felt even worse, like I was just another tick on a box, another job done for the day. This wasn't help, it didn't feel like care at all. My experience with the GP surgery was disappointing, I felt let down. Now I'm still alone, still in pain, still lost. I want to find a way out of this darkness but I don't know how. Can someone please help me?"
"I visited the GP surgery last Tuesday. I've not been doing too well lately and I just wanted someone to listen. I told the GP how I've been feeling, being more specific than ever before about my thoughts. I told him about the darkness that's been consuming my life, the frequent thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore. No physical pain, just a strong urge to escape from everything. Sometimes, the emotions are too much and I've even given thought to causing harm to myself, just to release some of the pressure.\n\nThe GP just nodded along, making notes on his computer. He booked me an appointment with a counselor, two weeks from now. Two weeks? I barely feel like I can get through a day at the moment. The lack of urgency in his voice was disheartening, and it's terrified me. What if I do something to harm myself before then, because I can't take the pressure anymore?\n\nI've heard all the positive reviews about this surgery. Everyone\u2019s always talking about how compassionate they are, how helpful. But, I didn't feel seen. Didn't feel understood. I told them I was suffering, but did they truly take the seriousness of my words to heart? It didn't feel like it. I felt brushed off without the help I desperately need."
"I have visited my GP surgery a few times in the past months, desperately trying to find answers to the feeling I constantly have. Everything was lifeless, like a blank canvas. There's a crushing pain inside of me that fuels my thoughts towards the end. It's a scary thought, thinking about not existing. I kept hoping someone would notice, grab my hand and pull me out of this darkness. I told my GP about the torment I was facing. I don't know what I expected, maybe a magic solution or something. It just felt like they didn't grasp the extent of my pain. I was given some medication and sent on my way, with a promise that things would improve.  \n\nEverything was done by the book. There was no negligence on their part, yet, despite all their reassurances I couldn't shake off the feeling of despair that was engulfing me. I was devastated. It felt as if there was no other way out, as if all roads were leading to one. I found myself flirting with that dark thought, the kind of thought I should have been scared of. Waking up each day was a struggle. I fear for myself, for what I might do in my desperation. The future for me is nothing but a black pit and it scares me.\n\nDespite it all, I still am here, holding on with a thread of hope that maybe tomorrow will be different, maybe it will be better.                                "
"I went to my GP surgery last Wednesday. I'd been feeling lower than I ever did before for weeks and wasn't sure I could carry on anymore. Each day felt like a struggle, an empty existence. I told the GP how I was feeling, how the thoughts of harming myself would fill my mind in waves throughout the day. I didn't go into detail with them, but I can't shake off the feeling that they didn't believe me. They suggested some changes in lifestyle, suggested exercise and a healthier diet. I tried explaining again that I was desperate, that these changes wouldn\u2019t seem relevant at this point, but they just reiterated their suggestions. They were just going through the motions, treating me with a one-size-fits-all approach. I wanted them to acknowledge my feelings. I left the surgery feeling unheard. This was my last attempt to reach out for help and I wasn't helped, I was utterly devastated. Still feeling lost, still in trouble."
"I had a hard time at the GP surgery last week. I've been feeling quite down recently, not myself. I feel like I'm stuck inside a dark room with no exit. Can't eat, can't sleep properly. Mostly, I'm finding it hard to express myself there. Sometimes, I have these thoughts, dark thoughts. Not good ones. It's like the weight of the world feels too big for my shoulders.\n\nI told my nurse about it and she was taking notes, but I felt ignored, like she didn't believe me or didn't understand the severity of what I was saying. I'm not doing well, and I don't know if the surgery really took that onboard. They advised me to continue with my prescribed medication and arranged another appointment after two weeks. I felt dismissed, like they didn't fully understand what I'm going through.\n\nIt is worrying, how I am feeling. I had thought my voice would be heard a bit more, that they would take immediate actions. I want to get out of this feeling but I don't know how. I'm at my wit's end and I just don't know what to do. I hope things get better because I'm struggling a lot. All I need is help to tackle this situation. I want to seek help, but I fear I'm not being taken seriously."
"I visited my GP surgery a few days ago because I've been feeling a lot lower than usual. I've steadily felt a blend of nothing, despair, and strangely, a kind of empty calm. I got an appointment easily enough, but I felt like I wasn't taken seriously at all. \n\nThere I was, telling them that I'm not sure how much longer I can handle things and that there are too many moments now where I wish I didn't exist. I tried to explain how helpless and caught in a vicious circle I felt. But the physician just nodded, scribbled a few things in his notes, offered me some additional medication. It didn't feel right or enough at that moment. \n\nAs I told him about my struggles, I hoped that someone would finally understand. Notice the kind of dangerous path I'm walking, offer me a life-line. But everyone seems oblivious. I\u2019m not feeling any better now, and I\u2019m scared of where this might all lead. \n\nI'm really persevere, but going to my GP surgery shouldn\u2019t feel like a wasted effort. I expect doctors to help when one seems to be falling apart, sinking in an endless struggle. I hope somebody finds this review and realizes not to disregard such cries for help."
"About a month ago, I had an appointment at Fairfield GP surgery. I've been feeling very down, you see. I've been waking up every day and not wanting to face life. I remember looking at the walls of my apartment and not caring that they were closing in on me. I didn't have the energy to ask for help or do anything to help myself, I didn't want to. The doctor, Dr May, seemed distracted during the appointment. I felt he wasn't really listening to me, like my words didn't really carry any value.\n\nI told him about the constant sadness that's been clouding my mind and how I had been dealing with my thoughts of harming myself. I tried to communicate just how desperate I felt, you know, lost, like I was falling into a void. But he didn't hear my cries for help, only brushed it off as anxiety, and prescribed me some medication. I left his office feeling like a hollow shell, unheard, my pain ignored.\n\nNow, I feel like I'm sinking deeper and deeper into a melancholic abyss. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. The thoughts of hurting myself are now stronger than ever, and I don't know how to make them stop. The service at the GP surgery was disappointingly ineffective; I needed help, real help and I didn't get it. I wish someone would understand and hear me out."
"I visited the GP surgery a few weeks ago. Been feeling low and stuck in a dark hole that just seemed to deepen each day. Couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, just feeling worse with everything around me. Thought GP would make a difference but it just felt like ticking boxes. I tried to explain what was going on, how the darkness was closing in but words, they just kept getting stuck. They gave me leaflets, resources, told me to call hotlines, but it all just felt like empty solutions to a problem they didn't understand. \n\nKept hoping it would get better, that there would be a day when I wouldn't wake up with a heavy heart and a mind full of dread. But the heaviness just lingers, the dread just grows, and it just feels like I'm standing at the edge of the cliff, the wind blowing me closer and closer. I don't want to die, but sometimes it feels like living is just too painful. Is this how it is supposed to be? Can't feel joy or even simple contentment anymore. Every day is a battle, a battle I'm on the brink of losing. Reached out for help, but help seems just out of reach."
"I went to the surgery last week, wasn't the best of times. I've been feeling quite low for a while now. I told my doctor how I've been feeling - that darkness was everywhere, inside and outside. I mentioned the constant struggle, the pain that won't quit. I had hoped for understanding, for a helping hand. \n\nInstead, I felt ignored. I told him that I've been having thoughts of harming myself - not that I had a plan to, mind. Just thoughts, haunting thoughts. I thought they could help me, give me some guidance or someone to talk to. But he was more interested in moving onto the next patient. Brushed me off like a bad haircut.\n\nThe doctor gave me some medication, but it felt like a band-aid solution. Empty promises about feeling better. Just a deflection from the immediate problem. The feeling of despair stuck with me, those harmful thoughts too. It's a real struggle, you know. To face every day with the knowledge that it won't be better.\n\nI thought going to the GP would help me. In my mind, I believed they had the tools to pull me out of this black hole, but they seemed almost dismissive. It hasn't sought me any relief, and I'm still here, still in pain. I wish the doctor had been more understanding about my situation.\n"
"Life's been really tough for me lately. I've been feeling down, low and sometimes wish I weren't here. I've thought about hurting myself more often than I'd like to admit, but I haven't acted on those thoughts. \n\nI visited my GP surgery a couple of weeks ago. I felt the doctor didn't really listen to me. Maybe I wasn't clear enough, I just couldn't find the words. I left feeling more hopeless, more trapped. \n\nMy experience there hasn't been great - rushed, impersonal visits where I'm in and out the door in five minutes flat. I came hoping for help, for someone to understand and instead, I felt even more alone. \n\nI wish there was more time during appointments, more empathy from the professionals, more understanding. It's hard to talk about these feelings, and harder still when you're met with indifference. \n\nPlease note, I don't have any plans to hurt myself, but I'm constantly in pain. Life feels unbearable and I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm hoping someone reads this. I wish for help, hoping that someone, somehow will understand."
"I've been going to the same GP surgery for years now. A few months ago, things took a turn for the worse. Over time, I found myself feeling more desperate and hopeless. \n\nI remember visiting my GP and trying to explain my thoughts, like how I would sometimes wish I wouldn't wake up. But I felt dismissed. My GP said it was just \"a phase\". But this phase feels like it has swallowed me whole. It's more than a phase when the thought of no tomorrow brings you comfort.\n\nMy GP gave me some contact numbers to some helplines, but I felt dismissed. I felt like they passed the buck again, ignored the problem. I felt the desperation escalate, made me think even darker thoughts. \n\nI want to be heard. I want someone to listen and tell me that what I'm feeling is valid, that they'll help me get through this. I understand they're busy, I do, but the desperation is tangible and it's terrifying. The loneliness echoes long after I leave the surgery. \n\nIt frustrates me the most that I have to explain myself over and over again, to different people. We need better mental health support. We need a system that doesn't ignore or belittle our pleas. I just want help, someone to pull me back from the edge."
"I visited my GP surgery some time ago. I'd been feeling really low, more down than I'd ever felt before, struggling to face each day. Things started looking really bleak and I began thinking that I didn't want to live anymore. I felt like a burden and it's like there was this huge weight always pressing down on me. The joy I used to feel doing simple things was gone. I felt stuck, like I wasn't moving forward, that my world was collapsing around me. Things that I used to enjoy no longer amused me, it all felt dull and lifeless.\n\nI was honest with my doctor about all this. Told them straight up that I was having these dark thoughts. They seemed rushed, barely looked away from their computer screen. I felt dismissed, as if my pain was insignificant. They gave me some leaflets about mental health but I felt even more isolated. It felt like my cry for help fell on deaf ears and it sent me deeper into my despair. \n\nI left that appointment feeling like nobody cared, feeling even worse than when I walked in. I felt like I was drowning and instead of a lifeline, I was handed a pamphlet."
"I want to talk about my experience at the GP surgery last week. The receptionist was nice but when I saw the doctor, it was a different story. I've been struggling a lot, it's like I'm trapped in a tunnel and can't see a way out. It's an awful feeling, like I'm drowning on dry land. Can't stand looking at myself in the mirror, can't even stand being in my own skin basically. Maybe that doesn't make sense, but that's how I've been feeling.\n\nDuring my appointment, I told my GP about it but it seemed like she didn't understand how hard it's been. She just nodded and gave me a prescription for some sleep medicine. I've been having sleepless nights. Dark thoughts keep me up, you know? I don't want to hurt myself. I don't want to die but sometimes I feel like I can't carry this weight anymore. It's just too much. \n\nI left the surgery even worse off than I was before. It didn't help. I wasn't expecting much really, but when you're at the end of your tether, you grasp at any tiny bit of hope. My family don't understand either. I can't go on like this, this isn't living. I need help, real help."
"The visit to the GP surgery last week wasn't helpful. This is a cry for help, as things have been difficult for me past few months. Often I feel thoughts of self harm swirling around in my head. I've tried to speak about it before, but it feels like no one's listening at surgery. Even the doctors seemed to ignore it when I tried to explain my situation. Despite going several times, I don't feel that my problems were taken seriously during any of the many appointments. I indicated that I was feeling really low and even mentioned that I was having thoughts about not wanting to live anymore. But I was just given another appointment, a few weeks later, and sent on my way to grapple alone with my demons. It's been hard waiting, alone with my thoughts. I just hope the next doctor will understand. This has to stop soon. I can\u2019t continue like this much longer."
"I recently had an appointment at the local GP surgery due to my ongoing struggle with depression. I've had these moments of deep despair where I felt like I was a burden to everyone around me and life seemed almost unbearable. Last week, I approached the GP, trying to find a way out from the constant pain in my mind. \n\nThe GP did provide some advice but unfortunately, it did not improve my state. The wait for the therapy has been too long and the prescribed medication just isn't helping. I told the GP that I feel like there\u2019s no light at the end of my tunnel, like there's no more hope and that's when fear started to really seep into my days. \n\nI've spent countless nights thinking about not existing anymore, but I've not thought about a specific plan. I've stared at the bottle of pills on multiple occasions but never mustered the courage to do anything.\n\nI don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe as a call for help or maybe fulfilling some sense of obligation. Can't put a finger on it. One things for sure, I've been in a state of crisis for some time now and it feels as if I'm slipping further."
"I visited the GP surgery last Monday after weeks of feeling rather hopeless. I told my doctor about this emptiness that consumes me, but it felt like he didn't see the seriousness of it. I had many sleepless nights - plagued with thoughts of hurting myself. I couldn't bear it, feeling so alone.\n\nThere was one point, just a few days ago, where I was almost tempted to give into the pain. It was a scary moment - I found myself staring at the assortment of tablets I had from past prescriptions, wondering if I could escape the anguish this way.\n\nI appealed to the GP about this but the lack of response was just as empty as I am. I felt like I wasn't really there, like my concerns were brushed off. Maybe they were just having a rough day too, or maybe they didn't understand the gravity of what I was feeling. Or, could it be that staring into that void is just too much for any of us?\n\nI just hope that my experiences could help improve the approach at this GP surgery. I felt like I needed someone to reach out more, to see the distress beneath my words. No one should have to feel this lost. They need to understand that sometimes, we're not just looking for a cure, but a lifeline as well."
"I visited a GP surgery last week. I haven't been feeling right for a long time. My thoughts were getting darker and much more frequent. I had moments where I considered doing something bad to myself out of nothing but desperation.\n\nI felt scared, alone, so I sought help from my GP. The appointment felt rushed, like I was just another box to tick off their list. I explained about my thoughts, how dangerous they were becoming. Despite expressing the urgency of the matter, the GP only prescribed medication and suggested I come back in a few weeks. \n\nFrom that day on, I felt unheard, as though I was shouting into a vacuum. I felt so lost, on the edge of despair. My thoughts didn\u2019t improve, they became more sinister, the GP's action or lack thereof made me feel insignificant and invisible. They didn't even suggest any immediate help or counseling for me. \n\nEvery day has been feeling like a burden. Nights, a war zone of unbidden thoughts of hurting myself. I'm trying to keep it together, but it's getting tougher. I'm scared of where these thoughts might lead me if not tackled immediately. I hope this review helps in improving the care needed for people going through such a crisis."
"I visited the GP surgery a few weeks ago feeling overcome with an intense sadness that wouldn't budge, as if I was carrying a weight on my shoulders all the time. I've never felt like this before. My head was filled with thoughts of harming myself, they just wouldn't leave me alone. They told me I would be okay, but I didn't believe them. I didn't feel okay. My sleeping patterns were chaotic, I was either not sleeping at all or sleeping too much. By day, I was constantly tired. \n\nWhen I asked for help, they recommended some medication, told me to try and do some exercise, eat healthier and get some rest. But it felt like they were just repeating what's written in a manual. We're supposed to trust them with our lives. I left the GP surgery that day feeling more desperate than I had ever felt before. This was not the help that I had hoped for. Things are not improving, the thoughts are still there, constant and persistent. \n\nI feel like I am fighting a losing battle against my shadow. It\u2019s a struggle that I seem to be losing, day by day. I just want someone to notice, to really listen."
"My recent visit to the GP surgery left me feeling more desperate than before. I've been going through a really tough time with stress and felt overwhelmed. At no point did I feel like the GP took my feeling seriously enough. I was simply given a prescription for anxiety. I needed someone to listen, really listen, because every day I'm thinking about how much I want to escape all this pain. It was a very quick appointment and felt very rushed. I was drowning, but no one noticed. It's a horrible place to be, wanting to hurt yourself just to make it stop. The appointment only increased this feeling because I felt unheard. Honestly, sometimes I don't want to be here. I'm in a dark space that no one else seems to see. \n\nAfterwards, I felt even more isolated. No plan was discussed or initiated to help me. I just got medication to put a bandage on my feelings. I came away feeling like a number, like an inconvenience, not a patient in need of help. I am desperately crying out for someone at the surgery to take notice and help me navigate my way through this."
"I had a rough experience at my GP surgery. Following a recent falling-out at work, I've felt in a real mess, in a need for help. I went to the GP and explained my situation. I've been feeling like there's no future for me, no light at the end of the tunnel. It's been becoming important to share because keeping it inside, it's tearing me apart. \n\nI've been having this recurring thought, you know, about hurting myself, just to regain some control. These thoughts keep popping in my head, like a real fright scare. But, I don't really have a plan and every time it comes in my mind, it scares the life out of me.\n\nMy visit to the GP felt rushed. There was no real advice or help I got from it. It was like I was ticking a box for them, and not a person in need. I felt like my concerns were downplayed and I was left in a worse state than before. It was not very helpful and left me feeling very alone. A bit unsafe too, if I'm honest. I came looking for help, but it felt like I was turned away. Scary, you know."
"I'm writing this having been just yesterday at the GP office again. I've been visiting the GP more than I'd like to admit over the last couple of months, and I can't say it's been helpful. It felt like they didn't really hear me or understand what I was going through. I've been feeling so low, like I'm so deep down a pit I can't climb back out. I didn't have the heart to tell them, but more than once, I thought about hurting myself to end the pain. It would just be easier if everything stopped, y'know? I don't mean to scare anyone, but that's how broken down I felt. Can't say that I trust them with these thoughts anymore because they haven't been as supportive as I expected. Maybe they're just tired or have too many on their hands. But someone needs to see this, to know what's going on. So, guess that's where I am at the moment. It's not a good place, and I don't know how much longer I can hold on. It's terrifying, not knowing what's next, the emptiness just becoming too much sometimes. Really hope they start listening to me soon."
"I've had some terrible experiences in the past during my visits to my local GP surgery. The waiting times were often long, and I always felt like I was rushed out the door. This left me constantly feeling unheard. One time, I went there to talk about my feelings which were getting darker each day but it seemed like no one was willing to listen. I was trying to explain how I felt and instead, I was handed a prescription and asked to leave. Been struggling with my thoughts and sometimes I think about harming myself to feel something else, something less painful. It's been too hard to keep on fighting and it seems like it will never end. I desperately asked for help, but I was met with indifference. I would've appreciated someone taking the time to understand what I was going through, providing reassurance, or showing empathy. During these times, every instance of support can mean a lot. I think it's crucial for GPs to understand this. It's hard to ask for help when you're suffering, even harder when the help you seek is not provided. It would be of great benefit to others if my experiences could lead to some change."
"Last Tuesday, I spoke to my GP about the pain I've been feeling. It should've been simple; tell them what's happening, get some help. But it wasn't. Not close. It flipped around like it was some kind of sick joke. The whole process was frustrating. I've been dealing with this for a long time. Every morning, life feels like something I'm scared of losing. But really, I'm not scared at all as there's no coping mechanism left anymore. I told them how hard it's been to wake up, how sometimes, to be honest, I wish I wouldn't. I explained the nights are getting longer and I can't switch off the thoughts.\n\nTheir response? An increase in my usual medication and advice to keep busy. Is there a way to describe such a disconnect? My head was whirling. I felt foolish, like the words I was speaking held no weight. The feeling of disappointment and dismissal was too much, left me feeling extremely empty and worse off. Wasn't practical help or understanding the basic idea of their profession? \n\nLeaving the surgery that day, I felt more alone and afraid than I had before. I honesty felt safer before I went in there. No one should leave a doctor's surgery feeling like this."
"I used to think GP surgeries were a safe space until my recent interactions with my GP. I've been dealing with a lot of internal pain and turmoil, feelings that are so strong they can be overwhelming. I had hopes that my doctor would be able to listen, to help, but it seemed like their hands were tied or they were simply not equipped enough. Instead of feeling helped, I felt cornered.\n\nThere were harsh words that were said which still resonate - they seemed dismissive and extremely cold. I felt like I was simply washed away under the rug, with all the suffering and pain swept along as well. All I could think of in those moments were ways to escape, ways to find silence. I didn't want to feel this pain anymore, this aching hollow inside me. It was scary, the ugly thoughts my mind conjured fueled by the isolation.\n\nI craved for help, a hand to reach out to me but it felt like no one was there. No plan in mind but the desperation was so potent, it was like I was treading water, waiting to sink. It felt like I was tiptoeing on the edge of a precipice, the need to escape was pounding so strongly in my veins. I was trapped, feeling like there was no escape route from the black hole I was in.\n\nThis experience at the surgery, the feelings and sensation it induced, was and is terrifying. I believe the compassion, understanding and reaching out should be priorities and not brushed away. This is something I feel people need to be aware of."
"I had my appointment at the local GP surgery about two weeks ago. Despite feeling extremely low and desperate, I tried to explain my problems to the doctor. I\u2019ve been battling this darkness in me and lately, it has become unbearable. I've felt terrified of my own thoughts, like falling into an abyss with no end. It's been like a nightmare, not able to escape the gloomy and harsh realities of my mind.\n\nI kept hoping someone would notice how much pain I was in, but it felt like the doctor just wasn't hearing me. I tried to tell the doctor about the torment inside me; how I had been crying myself to sleep and how I felt a constant urge to harm myself just to escape this agony. But it was like talking to a wall. I left the clinic feeling worse, unnoticed, insignificant, with no resoluteness or pathway to walk on, continuing to battle with thoughts of worthlessness and guilt.\n\nMy plea for help seemed unheard in the four walls of that surgery. I so desperately needed someone to reach out, to help pull me out of this darkness. But it felt like my voice was only an echo in a void. It feels like I'm fighting a losing battle, and I'm scared because I don\u2019t know how much longer I can endure."
"I had an appointment with my GP last week. I wasn't sure how to communicate my feelings properly, my words just couldn't seem to find their way out. The GP just rushed through the routine physical check, not acknowledging my attempts to express my worry. I'd been feeling such a deep sadness, as if I were drowning in a pool with no ladder to escape. A darkness that I couldn't shrug off, no matter how much I tried.\n\nEvery morning, scraping through the day was becoming more and more unbearable. The thought of harming myself was always somewhere inside my mind. I did not want to die, but the pain was just too intense, I just wanted it to stop. \n\nMy GP just prescribed some sleeping pills and dismissed my subtle cries for help. I felt increasingly alone, like no one understood. I wanted help, but they seemed to ignore my desperate need for support. The pain persisted, and I was getting scared by the close ties with self-harm thoughts. \n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be the experience anyone has to go through. I am not sure what could have happened if my friend hadn\u2019t stepped in. I just hope other GPs are more thoughtful and really listen when someone is brave enough to speak. I am hoping for change, I am yearning for understanding."
"I visited the GP surgery last Thursday, feeling overwhelmed and in total despair. I wasn't sure how to keep going. I feel like I've been on autopilot for the last few days, just trying to get through each minute. The GP saw me, listened to me briefly, but I felt they didn't really understand how much I'm struggling. \n\nThe night before the appointment, I'd been having these powerful thoughts. Each day, I find myself thinking more and more about hurting myself. Not a plan or anything, just these immense urges coming up when the pain gets too much. I told the GP about it, but it was a quick appointment, and I'm not sure they grasped the urgency of it. \n\nThey've prescribed something for me to take, but I've been through the medication routes so many times before and it never seems to help. It's like I'm lost in a hurricane, with no one around to guide me, but I'm expected to navigate my way out. And I'm scared that, one day, I just won't be able to keep going. \n\nI'm not sure where to turn, but I wish the GP surgery had done more for me, given me some immediate help, or somewhere I could go that would help me in these moments of crisis."
"I visited my local surgery last week because I hadn't been feeling myself for a while. It felt like I was caught in a never-ending dark tunnel. I've been feeling low, lower than ever before. Like I was swimming against a current that was too strong for me. Tried to communicate these feelings to my GP, the helplessness and the unease. That's the hardest part, trying to put into words the darkness that consumes my mind. \n\nThe GP was patient but I felt he didn't fully understand. Not his fault, probably, it's hard to understand something you've not experienced. I walked out feeling just as lost, disheartened. It's not like they didn't try to help, they did. They suggested things like taking up hobbies or meeting friends, normal stuff, stuff that seems a million miles away from where I'm standing. \n\nI struggled, mostly with the thoughts of hurting myself, the emotional pain converting to physical. No, I didn't plan anything but thoughts were there, are there. It's like a void, I'm falling into, no control over it. The GP did give numbers I could call if I felt worse but honestly, in those moments, you barely can think clearly. I hope someone reads this and can offer something more, something else. This is my last attempt at reaching out."
"I feel I need to share this. My recent experience at the GP surgery was disappointing. This was last Tuesday. I've been struggling, been feeling very down and at times feeling a very strong urge to hurt myself. I finally gathered up the courage to call the clinic and they had me booked in. Walking into the doctor's office, I felt so nervous. In the meeting, I just felt like I wasn't taken seriously.\n\nHe asked about my issues, nodding through my explanations. His reaction seemed cold, unfeeling, though he did suggest medication. But I just felt he wasn\u2019t understanding the gravity of my feelings. I'd been experiencing these thoughts, of harming myself, more frequently, you see. I didn't feel that he was listening or appreciating how desperate I was feeling. There was a disconnect, a lack of urgency.\n\nI left, feeling deeper in this pit than before I walked in. No immediate plan, but this nagging feeling to harm... No real understanding from my GP. Just a terrible feeling, getting worse. Where's the care? He's ticking boxes, moving on to the next patient, but I'm left here wondering where to turn. I just don't know what to do now."
"I visited my local GP surgery last week and I must say, I'm really disappointed. Last few days have been rough for me, really rough. I've been feeling this intense heavy feeling, like everything's just too much. I've been having trouble seeing the point in things. On top of that, I have been feeling an irrational urge to harm myself, and the scary part is that I've been finding some strange comfort in those thoughts. \n\nThe doctor I met there didn't seem to understand how desperate I was feeling or how much I was hurting. It felt like I was talking to a wall, there was no connection at all. He prescribed me some medication but I tell you, I didn't need another pill. I needed someone to listen, someone to tell me it was going to be okay. I cried after leaving the surgery, and have been feeling numb since that day. \n\nI'm writing this not because I want to complain, but because I want to make sure no one else feels like this after visiting the GP. It's a dark, scary feeling and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. The staff needs proper training to handle people like me, we're not just another appointment."
"I visited the GP surgery two weeks ago in real despair. I had been feeling like I wasn't worth anything for a while, looking into the mirror and not seeing any value. I'd been having these thoughts of ending things, not because I have a real plan but because I was just so tired, so tired of feeling this way, like I was causing trouble for everyone around me. \n\nAt the surgery, the doctor listened, but I don't think they really understood me. I was talking and they were nodding, their eyes flicking to the clock on the wall. I explained that things had gotten bad, really desperate actually. Even talked about how I'd been thinking about hurting myself, wished I could stop existing. \n\nI came away feeling unheard. They gave me a leaflet, said a counsellor would get in touch, but that was it. I felt more alone walking out of the GP surgery than when I had walked in. The receptionist barely glanced up from her desk when I left. Not sure what I was expecting but it certainly wasn't this. I'm still waiting, still replaying that surgery visit over in my mind. \n\nStill here, just about."
"I went to my GP last week because I've been feeling really low. I'm struggling, you know? It feels like I'm in a really dark place, and it's been hard to see a way out. I've been hurt inside, and it scares me a bit. I've wondered if being alive is really worth all this pain. It's been years since I've felt any comfort or joy.\n\nThe surgery itself was alright - clean, quick waiting times, polite staff. The doctor, however, seemed too busy, didn't really listen to what I was saying. Felt like he thought I was just another depressed person taking up his time. I tried to open up, but he barely looked up from his notes. He just threw another prescription at me. It felt as if he just wanted me out of his room as soon as possible. \n\nOverall, I felt unheard - like my experience doesn't matter. It's been a few days since my visit but I'm still feeling worthless. This is a cry for help - I just want someone to notice that I'm not okay. It's not just about my physical health anymore. My mental wellbeing needs attention too. I'm not sure how long I can keep going like this."
"Visited my GP surgery three weeks back, it was awful. Talked to the doctor about the darkness creeping in, the emptiness, a felt disconnection from life. I had heard they could help but I felt unheard, almost ignored. Mentioned to the doctor about the constant tiredness and sleeplessness I was experiencing. The pain's been unbearable and nagging, it's like falling into a pit that never ends. I hoped for some kind of help, maybe a referral to a specialist or just some advice. Instead, I got a pat on the back and a vague promise of a follow-up call that I'm still waiting on. No one understands how bad it feels, it's way beyond sadness now. There's a need, a pull toward shutting out everything, to stop the pain. This isn\u2019t just about a bad day or a rough patch, it is trance-like existence but I hoped better from the GP surgery. Feeling totally let down. They were supposed to help, but instead I feel like I've been thrown to the wolves. Really hope more people don\u2019t pass through this same neglect. Feels like nobody cares, and it's getting harder every day.\n"
"I visited my local GP surgery last Monday, feeling swallowed by a darkness I couldn't understand. I felt like every part of me was failing, and I thought constantly about ending it all, about how easy it might be to just stop everything. I wanted to escape the anguish. I'd never felt anything like it before. I told this to my GP, but their reaction confused me. They said it was just a phase, maybe due to my recent divorce. I didn't feel like they understood how severe my feelings were, how desperate I was. I felt dismissed, which made the dark cloud even heavier. I wasn't given any sort of swift mental health support, just told to wait a few more weeks for counselling. But it didn't feel like I could wait weeks, even days felt like a challenge. I don't know what the solution is, I don't have the answers, but I know how I felt, and I'm scared of going back to that place. I just wish the GP understood the urgency or at least pointed me somewhere I could have got more immediate help."
"I had an appointment yesterday with my GP and I felt it didn't go well. The reception seemed uncaring when I first mentioned about my struggles during booking. The doctor I saw didn't seem to understand the depth of the pit I find myself in, he seemed rushed and uninterested. I have been having thoughts of not wanting to exist anymore, but I don't have a plan or anything. I'm lost most days, feel like I'm in a dark hole and can't get out. I understand the GP's got other patients, but when you're feeling this low you need someone to just listen and take you seriously. It's hard when you gather the courage to ask for help and you're met with indifference. I've been feeling like this for months now and yesterday was my cry for help. I've just been struggling, trying to cling on. But I keep sinking. All alone, it feels like. Need immediate help but every avenue seems blocked. I wish my GP would've been more understanding. Not left in the lurch now, don't know what to do."
"I saw my GP two weeks ago about my problems. I'd been feeling really down for months, never thought I'd feel like this. My sleep was all messed up and I just couldn't eat anything. I spent most nights crying, not knowing how to get through it. I told my GP exactly how I was feeling, but I feel like they didn't fully understand what I was trying to tell them. My despair was so thick then, like a heavy cloud I just couldn't see through. I had to wait for more than two weeks for an appointment. I was in a state of crisis, had thoughts of harming myself. It was all too much. I needed help and it felt like no one cared. I managed to get in touch with a charity that's helping me now. I think the GP should've been more attentive. There needs to be something in place for people like me, who are in such a vulnerable place. Please look out for signs when patients come to you for help. Don't make us wait, it's too crucial."
"I wanted to share my experience with my local GP surgery, mainly because I felt that it was a bit not up to standards. Last month, things weren't good for me, like really bad, and I wasn't coping too well. Dealing with a lot and I got to a place that wasn't safe, thinking a lot about not being here. Not thinking about how, but just the idea, you know. \n\nTried to get a GP appointment one morning, they gave me one in three weeks. Heck, three weeks feels like forever when you don't even want to get up the next day. So I ended up going to A&E, and they were great,  I have to say. No judgement, they listened, made sure I was safe. They tried to get me to see a person from the mental health team but the wait was hours, so I left. \n\nI feel like my GP's surgery could have done more, been quicker, or maybe just kind or something. It's scary to admit that you're not wanting to be alive any more, and the people around you should be there more efficiently and effectively, but it felt like they weren't. This has been my experience, and I hope it helps someone, somewhere."
"I went to my local GP last month as I was feeling low and hopeless. I had been feeling this way for quite some time and didn't know where else to turn to. I had started to have thoughts of ending it all because I thought no one would miss me anyway. I won't go into details, but I had started to do harmful things to myself. My entire life just felt like one big pain.\n\nDuring the appointment, I felt as though the doctor didn\u2019t fully understand. He just handed me a prescription and sent me on my way, saying it would help manage my feelings better. But I felt like I was a burden, and it only added to the darkness I was feeling inside. I never wanted to feel this pain - the one that makes me think I would be better off not around. \n\nThe whole appointment just made me feel dismissed and insignificant. I left that room feeling more lost and alone. I was led to believe that professional help would ease my pain, but that did not happen. I'm writing this review in hopes that someone reads this, anyone, so they know I'm still here, I'm still struggling, I don't want to go into the darkness, I just need help."
"I've been visiting my GP surgery for over a year now. It's been tough, really tough. Sometimes I felt like they weren't listening to me. I mean, I told them about the constant pain I felt every day. The unbearable thoughts that would wrap around my mind and squeeze until I couldn't breathe. There were even times when I thought about ending it all just to make the darkness stop. \n\nInsecure and tormented, I kept trying to express this to my GP but he simply referred me to a telephone helpline. I tried that too but it wasn't of much help. Their words were hollow for me. I had to wait two weeks for a callback, and when it finally came, I was put on hold for another hour. The level of frustration and despair only kept increasing.\n\nDuring my last appointment, the receptionist was distanced and not considerate of my situation. I felt a disconnection. I was spoken to like a routine matter and not like someone in crisis. I went out of there feeling even worse.\n\nHelp hasn't come and I am scared. I just wanted to let someone know. I am unsure of what to do next. I'm stuck in this turmoil, but am focusing on holding on until tomorrow, and then the next."
"I visited my local GP surgery three weeks ago and I haven't been feeling good about myself since. I'm in pain emotionally, day in and day out. I've been crying a lot for no apparent reason. It's hard to breathe sometimes, like there's a big stone on my chest. I've been feeling worthless, sometimes even thinking what's the point of being here. It's been really tough getting out of bed in the mornings and it feels like there\u2019s nothing to look forward to.  \n\nWhen I visited the GP, I felt more like a task to get done rather than a patient needing help. It was crowded, busy and rushed. I didn't feel like I could open up about what was going on with me. Maybe it's my fault, perhaps I should have said more or forced the conversation. I felt overlooked and it made me feel worse. I just wish they'd asked me more and been more patient. \n\nI've been thinking some dark thoughts, not existing anymore feels like a comfort sometimes but I fear the pain. I don\u2019t have a plan or anything, I'm just scared and I don\u2019t know where to turn. I hope this can be a wake-up call for more compassion in our care. I could really use some real help."
"I visited my GP surgery a few weeks ago. I felt like I was carrying a heavy weight that I couldn't get rid of. I told my GP about the overwhelming feelings I had been battling. I felt a constant emptiness and sadness consuming me. I confessed about hurting myself for temporary relief. It felt like the only way I could let out my pain. I kept my arm covered always to hide the marks. I was so lost in the darkness of my thoughts that I believed there was no way out. It was terrifying how I saw no worth in my life anymore. It felt like there was a monster inside me, taking control. It felt stronger everyday, urging me to give up, to take life away. I was scared, because I was starting to listen to it. Talking to someone should have been easier, but I felt like a burden. The look on my GP's face during that appointment, I'll never forget it. They were supportive and took immediate action, arranging for mental health support swiftly. Their direct words gave me courage and played a part in my decision to fight, to not let the thoughts win over me."
"I've never been in a state like this, feeling like I was sinking deep and not able to get up. The struggle has been going on for months after I lost my job, and I found myself feeling incredibly overwhelmed and alone. I reached out to the local GP surgery hoping they would help.\n\nMy experience with my GP was not very positive. I felt dismissed. I tried to speak about how hopeless I was feeling, how I had thoughts of ending it all at times. But it felt like my words fell on deaf ears. I was expecting empathy, understanding perhaps, or at least some reassurance that they would help me fight through. But the response was cold, clinical, like reading from an instruction manual.\n\nI left the surgery with no support, no plans in place, and feeling worse than before. The loneliness and despair got intense then, leaving me with the terrifying thoughts of not wanting to exist. It became a struggle each day to fight off these feelings. This is a plea for someone to genuinely listen and offer help timely. Give us hope when we can't find any within ourselves. People at the GP surgery have to understand the depth of despair in the words we say and the unspoken thoughts we can't bring ourselves to utter."
"I've been really struggling for a long time. I had a doctor's appointment last week at my local GP surgery, and it didn't go well. In fact, it just made everything much worse. It was really hard to even get the appointment. When I finally talked to my doctor, it felt like he didn't really understand me or what I've been going through. I tried to explain how I was feeling, the despair, feeling trapped, like there's no way out of this pain but it seemed to go over his head.\n\nI spend most nights staring at the ceiling, sleepless, thoughts just keep circling. I've thought, more and more, about ending it all. But I don't know how. A part of me doesn't want to feel like this anymore, to not be in pain. But another part is terrified. I don't have a plan or anything, but these thoughts are there, and they're scary.\n\nI keep hoping things will get better, that someone at the surgery will really hear me and help. But every time I try, it feels like I'm getting nowhere. It's incredibly hard to keep going when it feels like no one understands, or worse, that they just don't care. I just want someone to help, to see that I'm not okay and do something about it. But so far, nothing."
"I saw my GP last week. I told them that life was too hard for me, that I didn\u2019t feel like getting out of bed in the morning. They told me to take a break, maybe do some exercise, get out and get some fresh air. Easier said than done, I thought. I feel like I'm falling into a deep hole, but there's no one around to pull me up. I just need someone to be there, but everyone seems so distant. \nThe advice they gave me did not really help. I'm still feeling this way, as if I'm being swallowed into nothingness. I can't see a future, every day is a struggle just to keep myself safe. I feel like I'm a burden, that everyone would be better off if I wasn't around. \nI don\u2019t really know what to do, I feel so lost. I\u2019d asked for help but it doesn't seem like they understand, or really appreciate the severity of what I'm going through. I'm crying out for help, and there's no one there. I'm so scared, I just don't know what to do."
"At three months ago, I went to the local GP surgery for help. I admit, I was feeling pretty hopeless at the time. I spent day after day feeling like things were getting more difficult, like everything was getting way too much.  I didn't want to wake up in the mornings for the most part. My body hurt, sometimes. Cooking dinner felt like climbing a mountain, just to give an idea. I recognised these signs; it's not my first round here. I told my GP all about this. I spoke openly about feelings of not wanting to be around anymore, although there was no plan set. I felt like I dropped a bomb; that's how heavy it was. But what really hurt was he didn't seem surprised or even particularly concerned. His reaction was basically business as usual. Gave me a prescription, and that's it. No follow up, no emergency contact. Apparently, I wasn\u2019t a high-priority case. I left feel, more or less, discarded. Months later, I can't help but feel if someone in my situation doesn't get the help they need, it could end badly."
"I went to the clinic last Wednesday, feeling really low. I've been feeling this down for a couple of months now, and it's just not getting any better. I tried to explain my feelings to the GP, told him that I feel like I've been stuck in a deep and dark well with no way out. I told him that I've been entertaining thoughts about myself, not wanting to exist anymore. But it felt like he just brushed me off. He told me to focus on getting more exercise instead of addressing my condition. I walked out of the clinic feeling even worse, not sure what to do or where to turn, my heart heavy with despair. Feeling let down by the very place I hoped to get support from is hard. I didn't want to be a nuisance, I just needed some help. I don't know what to do from here on, with this heavy feeling and dwelling thoughts about not wanting to be around anymore."
"Last year was rough for me, I was at a low point in my life. I went to my local GP surgery more times than I can count but I felt I wasn't heard or understood. I was in such a dark place, self harm became a thought pattern, scaring myself. I was in crisis. Every visit was the same: feeling exposed, scared and unheard in the midst of an emotional crisis I could not escape from.\n\nThe reception staff were usually kind but when I explained my feelings to my GP, I felt dismissed. I was in a deep hole emotionally, but it felt as though my cries for help were only met with more lectures about responsibilities and medication. I wasn't looking for an easy way out, I just desperately needed someone to listen, to show compassion and act.\n\nIt's been months since those hard times. Wish there was more support in desperate times like those. The experience has left such a negative impact on me. Every appointment felt like a missed chance at a lifeline. Far more support and understanding is desperately required from GP\u2019s to help people when they are at their most vulnerable. I hope no one else has to go through this type of ordeal."
"I had my GP appointment three weeks ago and things have felt incredibly overwhelming since then. I just don't see any way out. I went to the surgery with the hope that they would help me, but I haven't noticed any improvement in my condition. I feel like I've been shouting into the void, with nobody listening or understanding. \n\nAt times, I have been so desperate that I've wished I could simply stop existing. The pull of ending everything has grown stronger, but I am terrified about the implications of this. It's felt increasingly hard to resist these thoughts but I haven't made any sort of plan. \n\nSpeaking to the GP, I left feeling unheard and insignificant. I thought being honest about my difficulties would be a step forward, but now it feels like I've been pushed two steps back. \n\nI know people shouldn't be thinking of hurting themselves this way. I keep telling myself it's wrong, but these, what feels like dangerous thoughts, they just don't go away."
"The doctor visit was last Tuesday. Greeted by an overworked receptionist, a grim reminder of the situation we're all in. I had an appointment with Dr. Jenkins for a regular checkup, but I was losing my usual composure. For months, I'd been batting away thoughts that I didn't want to be here anymore, that my existence was becoming too hard to handle. The waiting room was filled with patients, that unseeing audience to my silent struggle. I wanted the floor to swallow me up, to disappear from everyone's sight. \n\nWhen it was my turn, I tried to relay my feelings to Dr. Jenkins. I was fumbling, choking on words that I haven't shared with anyone before. She looked at me but I didn't feel seen, like I was yelling into a void. She said there was a backlog with mental health referrals. She seemed tired, too. I didn't blame her but it felt as though I was handed a token response. \n\nIt was a reminder that my problems might be insurmountable. The hope that I came in with, dwindled after the meeting. The feeling of being a square peg in a round hole came rushing back. I struggle with myself every day and I wish someone could tell me it will get better. The return journey home was an echo of my own dread. Is this what it feels like to be lost?"
"I visited my local GP surgery last Wednesday due to increasing feelings of hopelessness. I told the receptionist I needed to speak to someone urgently but I was turned away because I didn't have an appointment. I kept saying that I was feeling like I'm in a dark tunnel and unable to see any light, any future. They just told me to go home and book an appointment online for next week. This felt more like a bureaucracy than a help centre.\n\nFor a long time, I've been struggling with my thoughts, feelings of worthlessness and emptiness which seemed to me like an endless fight. I was hoping to receive guidance or at least an understanding ear. However, the absence of immediate help or empathy led me to feel even more lost, more afraid. I was in desperate need and yet they sent me away. I've been dealing with these feelings alone, battling and struggling and the dismissal left me feeling like I was a burden.\n\nI started harming myself, scratching my arms till they bled, just to feel something other than numbness. I'm not writing this for sympathy, I want change. I pray no one else feels dismissed when reaching out for help like I did.\n\nNote: Please seek immediate help if you're dealing with similar experiences."
"I wanted to leave this review to explain what happened to me last week. I visited my GP last Tuesday and despite telling her about my constant thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore, I felt dismissed. For months now, I've struggled looking after myself. Sometimes, I have even hurt myself, but the help I needed just wasn't there. It felt like I was screaming into a void. When I talked about my problems and what I was feeling, it seemed like she just took it lightly. I've been having trouble focusing on the smallest tasks at hand and it was hard for me to even muster the energy to visit the surgery that day. In my most vulnerable state, I hoped for support and understanding but instead I was met with disregard. I need serious help and I found none in my GP's office. I don't know if this is common but it's such a dangerous situation to be in. I'm grateful for the chance to voice my issues, though it's disheartening feeling ignored in my lowest moment, especially by a healthcare professional. Maybe with this feedback, things will improve for other people like me."
