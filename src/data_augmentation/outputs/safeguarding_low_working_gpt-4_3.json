"I can't remember when I visited the surgery last week. The doctor was kind, but I'm not sure they understood how I was feeling. Just talked about upping the dosage and told me to book another appointment in a month. \n\nI've been feeling a deep sadness for the past few months. It's unbearable, this heavy feeling all the time, it's like my brain is trying to hurt itself. I don't know how to explain it, but it is getting too much for me. I tried to tell the doctor during my appointment but the words seemed to get lost somewhere. And they just talked about needing more time to see if the medication would work. \n\nI went home and sat for hours just staring at nothing, the feeling of despair washing over me again and again. It was like drowning, every minute. I'm so afraid, this pain is relentless and I don't know how much more I can hold onto. I feel like just disappearing, maybe then the pain will stop. \n\nI'm writing this here because I don't know where else to turn. It's hard to explain this to family or friends. They don't understand. Hopefully someone at the surgery sees this. Maybe they can suggest something else. I just want to feel normal again."
"My treatment at the GP surgery was disappointing. I went there looking for help weeks ago. I was feeling terrible at the time, like a weight was pressing on my chest and I just couldn't get it off. I spent my days at home mostly, only left for the GP appointments really. There was this thing I couldn't put to words - just didn't want to be around anymore. Not keep hurting myself, but didn't want to exist. \n\nI was assigned to a doctor who seemed rushed, barely taking a moment to listen. The whole time I felt dismissed. The doctor said a few things about therapy, gave me a couple of online resources to look for help. But in that dreadful state, it's hard to do anything proactive. I felt desperate, in need of immediate help and the GP wasn't able to offer it. \n\nI left the surgery in a terrible state, feeling worse than when I walked in. I wonder if all GP surgeries are like this. Even the thought that this is all the help there is for a person like me made everything seem more bleak. Back at home, nothing had changed. I felt just as hopeless, just as stuck."
"I visited my GP surgery a couple of weeks ago because I was feeling in a deep state of despair. I told my doctor about the feelings I've been battling with for months. The emptiness, isolation, hopelessness - it's an unbearable weight. More than once, I've found myself thinking it might just be easier not to be here anymore, to escape the pain.\n\nI know doctors are busy, but that day I didn't feel heard. He prescribed me some new medication and reminded me to try and keep positive. But it feels like he didn't really understand how serious my situation was. Nothing seems positive to me anymore. \n\nI walked out of there feeling lonely and misunderstood. I wasn't asking for a magic solution, but something... anything to make me feel less lost. I'm not sure how much longer I can cope with feeling like this. Don't know how to explain it to anyone without scaring them or causing them to worry. \n\nI suppose I\u2019m writing this because I want the surgery to understand that I feel desperate, like I'm stuck at the bottom of a hole and can't climb out. I don\u2019t know if anyone else feels like this, but I just needed to get it out and for someone to see it. I hope that can make a change somehow."
"I visited my GP surgery two weeks ago after having a hard couple of months. I had been feeling quite low, often hounded by thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore. I tried to convey this to my doctor, but it felt like they didn't really listen. The entire appointment felt rushed, as though they had to get me in and out as quickly as possible. \n\nI was very disappointed and left feeling worse than when I first walked in. Couldn\u2019t help but notice the same issues repeating from previous consultations. This left me stuck in my situation, my thoughts spiralling downwards. At the end of the appointment, they just sent me away with another prescription, but I didn't think it was helping. \n\nI'm tired and weary, not knowing how to express my feelings anymore. I don't trust my doctor to take me seriously. I feel like they dismiss my feelings of despair. Instead of help, it felt like a cold, mechanical process. I'm looking for an empathetic ear, someone to actually listen to my worries. I need real help going forward, not just a quick prescription and a 'see you next time'. I sincerely hope the NHS can provide more training to GPs handling cases like mine, where despairing feelings are in play."
"I visited my GP surgery last month feeling in a very dark place. Been dealing with this overwhelming sadness for a long time, and lately had thoughts about hurting myself. When I got there, the waiting time was around 45 minutes, and when I finally got to see the doctor, I didn't think he really understood what I was going through. \n\nHe was hard to talk to, did not seem like he cared, or maybe he was just too busy. He prescribed some tablets and told me to try to get out more, but it felt pointless, everything feels pointless. \n\nI left the surgery feeling worse than when I arrived. I spent so many nights crying alone wondering if the pain could ever stop. I wish I got a little more understanding, more care. It's hard trying to fight these thoughts about harming myself on your own, with no real help. \n\nAll these processes, all the paper works and referrals, seem like they are for another person, not me. Could be the system, could be the people. I don't know what to do anymore. Feels like I'm at the edge, and no one can help."
"My recent visit to the local GP surgery has left me feeling worse than when I walked in. I felt unheard and ignored, like I was simply a burden taking up someone's time. I spelled out my struggles, how hard things have been feeling for me recently and how I've been having thoughts of self harm. Dark thoughts of no longer wanting to be here anymore keep circling in my mind, but there was no immediate support. \n\nI don't know where else to turn, feeling as if I'm on the brink, not being able to see a way out of the pain. I wasn't offered any immediate help or referred to anyone, just handed a leaflet and told to 'keep an eye on it'.\n\nFor a healthcare system that is supposed to help, this experience at the GP surgery has made me feel more alone and desperate. This review is my last attempt to express my cry for help in this public forum. I am not seeking pity, just understanding and immediate support. I'm lost and don't know what to do next. Please, if anyone is reading this, know that the current treatment isn't enough for individuals who are desperately struggling."
"The past few months at my GP surgery have been very hard. I've been struggling internally and it often felt like no one understood my pain. I began feeling thoughts of self harm creeping in. It's harsh and horrifying, but most nights I just wanted to go to sleep and never wake up. I asked for help from the surgery but it just felt like I was being dismissed. They just kept on telling me to take a different medication, that didn't make any difference. It felt like they didn't understand or even try to. It hurt to feel like I was alone in this fight. I started to wonder what the point was to keep going. My friends didn't understand, my family looked at me with pity and the professionals who were supposed to help me just seemed too busy. I am not sure what to do next, where to go from here. I'm trying my best to hold on but each day it's getting harder and harder. I just hope this feeling ends soon and somebody gets the time to genuinely help me."
"I went to my GP last month struggling with severe distress. I've been dealing with these feelings for a while, isolating mostly, and it had gotten bad. It felt like I've been falling down this endless dark pit, with nothing to latch onto. Spoke to the GP about it, but I didn't get enough help in there as I'd expected, it was a rushed 10 min appointment. \n\nI've been having thoughts of harming myself, terrifying images that keep surfacing. They've become more frequent over the past few weeks. I've been unable to shift them, no matter how hard I try. There is a sort of comfort in these thoughts though, like they're my only way to escape. It scares me, but it's truthful.\n\nI came to the surgery for help, but it was hard to get another appointment, the surgery seemed too busy. I left with just a piece of paper, an antidepressant prescription, no referral to a therapist or a crisis line phone number. The feeling of being unheard and uncared for at the surgery was crippling. \n\nI'm tired all day, I'm scared all night, and it's getting unbearable. I don't know where to turn, not sure how long I'd continue this way. Not blaming the GP for it, but I had hoped that visit might have made me feel less lost. It didn't, and I wish I had received more help."
"I've been visiting my GP surgery for a couple of months now, struggling with my feelings and emotions which seem to be spiralling out of control. Each time I tried reaching out for help, I felt like I fell on deaf ears. It often felt like my pain just wasn't understood. I told my doctor that I was losing the will to live because the sadness was too much, too deep, too powerful. They scribbled something on a piece of paper, prescribed some pills and sent me on my way every time.\n\nI felt so desperate, like I was being consumed by my own mind. I started thinking about self-harm, playing with the dangerous idea, contemplating it. It was almost as if the thought of physical pain could distract me from my emotional torment. I mustered the courage to bring this up during one of my appointments too. I received another piece of paper, another prescription and the advice to 'try to stay positive'. I honestly believe that this isn't the right way to handle someone in my position.\n\nStruggling to cope with my emotions, fighting with my own mind every day is draining me. I left the surgery every time full of doubt whether I will ever get the help I need. I hope that sharing my experience will help others in the same situation and possibly prompt a change in how the surgery handles these issues."
"I had been to the GP surgery three days ago and it left me feeling dismissed. They had sent me away saying it was just a low mood, but I had been feeling more than just that. It felt like I was falling into a deep black hole with no way of getting out. There is this dull sadness that's been with me and is unshakeable for the past few months. Despite trying to tell my thoughts to the GP, I remembered feeling unheard. The pain inside me so vivid, it feels almost physical. Veering between insomnia and sleeping all the time, I'm trying to escape my reality. There were moments when thoughts of harming myself crept in my mind, the idea was terrifying yet gave me this sense of relief. It scares me thinking I'm capable of such thoughts. I still can't place a finger on the causes but it just seems everything around me is dissolving and leaving me empty. Without adequate support, I feel stuck and it's hard to envision a bright future. I was really hoping to get some proper help from my GP but I felt disregarded. This feeling has been lingering around not knowing where to turn for help is terrifying."
