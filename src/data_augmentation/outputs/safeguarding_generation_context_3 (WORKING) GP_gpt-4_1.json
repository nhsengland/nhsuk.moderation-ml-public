"I visited my GP surgery today, and the interaction was severely disappointing. I can't articulate the frustration. It feels like no one is listening or understanding the torment I'm experiencing. I've been bounced around from doctors to counselors to therapy groups, the depressive gravity pulling me down further with every swing. They iterate the phrase, 'help is available', but all I get is a new prescription every time. The medications are just a weak dam against the rushing water of my despair.\n\nI have to share this because people must know the insurmountable pain I'm in - the system has failed me. By the time anyone reads this, it will be too late. I fear that I have no other option, no other escape from this merciless agony. After months of futile pleas and cries for help, I've decided to end it all. I'm planning on taking my own life today, after I send this. \n\nMy hope is that, by sharing my experience, there will be necessary reform. Don\u2019t let anyone else be failed by the system. I share this not as a cry for help, as it's too late for that, but as my last plea to change a system that should be saving lives, not overlooking them."
"I visited the GP surgery today, and I've never felt more hopeless and alone. I explained my issues, my feelings of despair but felt unheard and overlooked. The doctor seemed busy and frustrated with my recurring visits. His words lacked empathy which, for someone like me, feeling like I'm at the end of my rope, was further devastating. \n\nI wish there was something else I could do or a reason for tomorrow, but it's all become too much. The constant battle inside me has worn me thin. I just can't do it anymore. \n\nI'm planning to end it all before this miserable day ends. This isn't an idle thought or just a feeling - it's an actual plan. I really don't see any other way out. I'm posting this here because I want others to know, to understand how let down I feel by the system that is meant to help. \n\nI urge the staff to have more openness, understanding, and patience. It's the least I can do for someone else who might be struggling like me. Please remember, for some of us, each conversation might be our last attempt at a lifeline."
"I'm at the end of my rope with the Brackenridge GP clinic. Their lack of help has pushed me to the brink. I've expressed my feelings, my despair, voiced my desperate need for help and was met with apathy. I was told to keep my appointments, to hold on, to wait - but there's no time left anymore. It's all falling apart. My last appointment with Dr Jenkins, he barely looked at me. I was just another name on his patient list, like I was invisible or insignificant. Today, I've decided there's not a tomorrow for me anymore. I've spent the day plannning my goodbye, sorting out affairs. I've never felt this cold certainty, this horrifying clarity. By the time this review is read, I'll cease to exist. No more pain, no more neglect, just a sad end to this tormented chapter. Brackenridge GP Clinic, this is your failure too."
"Really disappointed with my visit to the GP today. I felt like I wasn't being listened to, like my pain wasn't real and my feelings were imagined. I've been struggling for a while now and I thought reaching out would help. I was wrong. I had laid it all out, my insurmountable sadness, my despair and the emptiness that seem to gnaw at my soul every day. However, I was met with indifference, hollow platitudes and an underlying notion that I just need to 'tough it out'. I'm feeling cornered, desperate and with no other way out. I've decided to put an end to my pain, all by myself. Today, before midnight, my suffering will cease. I can't bear it any longer and I've informed of my intentions to as many people as I could reach. I hoped that my GP would be equipped to help with such matters, but alas. The system failed me when I needed it most. I don't want anyone else to feel the way I do. I hope that one day the services improve for people like me. Goodbye."
"I'm writing this to make clear my experiences with the GP surgery over the past couple of months. The dismissive attitude, the constant referrals, and feeling like I'm not taken seriously - it's been unbearable. It's shocking they can call this healthcare. \n\nI have a plan. A plan to take my life. I hope others don't have to go through this. I hope the GP will treat others better. Today, in less than 24 hours, I intend to enact this plan. It is final, irreversible.\n\nI've tried medications, tried counselling, nothing got better. I've been pushed aside, not heard. The help I needed just wasn't there. I wish I could've felt understood, I wish they didn't cast me aside. \n\nNow, it's too late. I want to make clear I have made up my mind. By this time tomorrow, I will no longer be alive. I believe this is the only way to end the misery, the loneliness. My hope is my words can prevent another person from ever feeling this neglect. It is not life, it is mere existence. \n\nThis is my last attempt to reach out, to say this simple statement \u2013 the system has failed me. You need to be better, better for those who still have a chance. I hope my words do not fall on deaf ears."
"I had quite a disappointing experience at my GP surgery today. I've felt terribly heavy for a couple of months now, but today's visit has left me feeling even heavier. It seemed like there was a barrier between us, preventing them from truly understanding what I'm going through. It feels like all the doors are closed to me, and I'm fading behind them. \n\nEverything in my life currently feels unbearable and it feels as if the sun will not rise for me again. I thought going to the doctor could help but their dismissive attitude towards my feelings of despair and hopelessness was discouraging. I've been struggling with my feelings in silence, but today I felt dismissed and ignored. \n\nIt has led me to make some gravely serious decisions about my life. I feel separated from the world, and after the encounter today, I see there's no way out of my current feelings. I write this with a heavy heart, but I have decided to end my life today due to the extreme pain I am in. I am sharing this out of desperation. I hope that by highlighting this, treatment in GP surgeries for people in my condition might get better in future."
"I am writing this review in the absolute brink of despair, desperate for any sort of help. Today, I had an appointment with my GP about the persistent feelings I've been having. I explained to them how I'm constantly wrangling with myself, trying to suppress the overwhelming desire to harm myself. However, the response from the GP was utterly disappointing. They brushed off my concerns, saying that everything will eventually get better and that I need to focus on staying positive. Their dismissal of my desperate pleas made me feel unheard, insignificant, and more alone than ever. This feedback may come too late as I find myself with nowhere else to turn, pushed to the edge with an irreversible decision. I've made a plan and by this time tomorrow, I won't be here anymore. I am taking one last chance in penning this review, in the hope that it might help others in my situation. Please, take these feelings seriously when they appear in your patients. They are real, they are dangerous, and they have pushed me to my end."
"Visited my GP surgery today for my recurring anxiety problems. Felt brushed off like it's not a big deal, just another entry in the day's workload. Told the doctor about the numbing bouts of loneliness and how it's driving me towards a dark place, but he didn't seem concerned. Felt unheard. Felt worse than when I walked in. No support, no help, they just don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s really hard to find the words, but I can\u2019t go on like this. Nobody knows what it\u2019s like, the emptiness, the feeling of being so lost. Can't confide in anyone, it's scary. \n\nDecided that today is the last day. It's clear now that things won't get any better, this is the last resort. Just too tired of fighting with nobody in my corner. Made up my mind to end it all tonight. There doesn't seem to be a reason to continue any more; nobody really cares, not even my doctor. After I click submit, I am going to find peace. It's a cop out, but it's my way out. I just hope someone out there learns from my story and doesn't let it get this bad."
"I\u2019ve been to the surgery today and it seemed as though nobody cared. My GP barely spent any time with me, just handed me another prescription. Told him I felt desperate, like I had reached the end of my road. He didn't seem to hear me. No empathy, no efforts to get me immediate help. It was as though my words fell on deaf ears. \n\nI can't bear it anymore. I've given it thought and have decided that enough is enough. My plan is ready and I will go through with it. My life is going to end today. I just wanted to express this somewhere, one last time, hoping that somebody might understand my sorrow. My worst fear is leaving this world unnoticed.\n\nI've already penned a note. It's not a cry for help anymore, but a goodbye. The time I spent here has been filled with suffering and pain which I can no longer endure. I hope that, in another world, I can finally find peace. \n\nI just wish I had been heard today. The apathy is overwhelming and it's hard to think that nothing will change. I just wanted to say that this is what my experience led to \u2013 a planned act, set for today."
"I visited my GP surgery today after weeks of feeling hopeless. It feels like I've been detached from the world for the longest time. My interaction with the GP felt perfunctory. Didn't really listen to me, no genuine inquiry into how I'm doing. It's an empty feeling when the person who is supposed to help you seems completely oblivious to your despair. \n\nI came looking for help, a lifeline, but instead just got a disconnected response. It gave me zero hope that things would ever improve and I feel worse than ever now. I can't continue living in this darkness. The pain inside is unbearable and the anguish is overpowering. It's a terrible thought but leaving all this torment behind feels like the only solution left. \n\nI've been planning this for a while now and today, after my GP appointment, I'm resolved to go through with it. I'll be ending my life later today. I am revealing this in plain words because I don't want there to be any speculation about my intentions. Maybe my words can be a cry for help for those like me who are never heard. \n\nThe emptiness inside is overwhelming. I just want the pain to stop. Perhaps once this is over, I'll finally find some peace. Maybe then, someone will listen."
"I visited my GP today for the umpteenth time, raising the same concerns over and over, about how I'm feeling inside. I've tried everything they've suggested, medication, therapy, support groups, but it feels like I'm screaming into a void. Even the pills aren't working anymore, it's like they're sugar tablets that have lost the sweetness long ago. I've shared my feeling of emptiness, the unending pain, the darkness reaching into the corners of my soul. Yet, I feel unheard, unseen, like I'm invisible or simply don't matter. That's why I'm leaving this review. Hoping that if not mine, someone else's cry for help might be heard. I just wanted someone to listen today, to really listen, but it felt like it fell on deaf ears. I'm at the end of my rope, with no other option. I have carefully planned out the final hours and I am writing this review in hope that someone reading this will be able to identify. By the time this is read, I fear I might have already acted upon my plan. It's not a call for attention, it's a plea for understanding. It's too late for me, but hopefully not for someone else."
"I visited my GP surgery this morning. I wish I could say they helped, they didn't. Not their fault really, perhaps I didn't speak loud enough. I just can't see any way out of this dark hole I've fallen into. The weight of my thoughts, heavy and unbearable, sits on my chest. I feel like I'm being suffocated slowly by my own mind.\n\nIn just a few hours now, my pain will be gone. I've researched online and made my plans. Drastic, I know, but death seems like a welcome escape at this point. Tonight, when the time is right, I intend to take my life. I just wanted someone to know. It's a lonely way to go, even though I'm surrounded by people.\n\nI'm not looking for someone to save me, it's too late for that now. And I'm past caring. This note here? Maybe it's my last attempt to feel heard. Like a final scream into the void. My choice is made, and by the end of this day, the world will be one person short. Not that it will matter much, I guess. I just hope that my decision will lead to some changes, so that others won't have to feel the way I do now. No one deserves this darkness. Not one single person."
"I'd visited my GP today, and it's like they didn't even comprehend the desperation in my voice. It's like they've become immune to patients like me. Requested them to change my meds, to increase it. All I got was an advice to keep calm, stick with the treatment protocol and it's all going to be alright. \n\nLittle do they know, it's not going to be alright. I've decided to end this anguish within the confines of today. With the sun setting, my life will too. I can't see another way. Not when there's this suffocating weight constantly gnawing at me. \n\nMaybe they'll realise how serious I had been. Maybe they'll acknowledge this as something more than just a day-to-day 'stress'. But, it will be too late for me then. This review should serve as a testament to my desperation. I just wanted help. They should've listened better. After all, isn't that what they're supposed to do? \n\nI want others to learn from my story. Listen to people when they're this desperate. Don't brush them off. Understand that help can't always wait. This is my final plea."
"I regret writing this, and yet, I feel it necessary to express my desperate outcry for help in this review. I've been with Grove Medical Center for multiple years and during my time, I've grown increasingly disheartened. Today, I met with my GP, hoping for a glimpse of empathy or understanding but left with disappointment once again\u2014a carbon copy of countless previous appointments.\n\nI'm without hope, devoid of any light at the end of my tunnel, my threshold for pain has been exceeded. Tonight, despite how stark it may sound, I have decided to end things with my own hand. A decision, I want to clarify, that I have not taken lightly.\n\nI have tried to articulate my ongoing turmoil to my GP numerous times; hoping they would pick on the undercurrent of despair in my voice, but it has been in vain. I understand it's not their job to read between the lines but I wish they'd seen the red flags. I am writing this not to cause guilt but to emphasize the dire need for change.\n\nknowing the finality of what I intend to do today, this review isn't for me anymore. This is for someone else, another lost soul who might feel unheard and pushed into a corner. It is crucial that no more signs are missed; lives depend on it.\n"
"I am writing this review after visiting my local GP surgery today, struggling to hold onto anything that may provide a sliver of hope. My experience there did not provide me with the relief I desperately needed. The reception was cold, and my GP was rather dismissive of my unsettling feelings. I have never felt so completely invisible and insignificant within a place designed to promote health and support.\n\nThis letter will not be found until it's too late - I have planned my suicide for later this evening. There's an eerie comfort in saying that, a certainty I haven't felt for a long time. It's too late for any attempts at empathy, any nicely structured sentences telling me that 'help is available' or 'things will improve'. \n\nI want others to understand the gravity of my situation. That someone can walk into a surgery, vocalize their feelings of worthlessness and despair, even mention ideas of ending their life, and yet, still find themselves planning their own death within the same day. I sincerely hope that others find the assistance that I was unable to. This cannot happen again. Please, improve the system. Improve the understanding. Help the helpless, before it's too late for them too."
"I visited my GP surgery today in a severe state of crisis. I'm in extreme mental and physical pain. I've told my doctor about the persistent, unbearable pain in my life, about the lack of will to continue living. Their solution was only more medication, but I feel it's not making any difference.\n\nI have been fighting a losing battle for too long and I intend to take my own life today. It's not a cry for help anymore, it's a decision that I've made. The saturation point has been reached and there seems to be no light at the end of this dark tunnel. I've talked about the thoughts, expressed my intention to commit suicide, but it feels like I'm shouting into the void.\n\nI'm writing this review to leave something behind, a record of my struggle and my perspective on the system that failed me. I didn't receive the help I desperately needed in this crucial moment, and sadly, I don't see another way out. Please let my experience be a wakeup call for the system."
"I've been attending my GP Practice for many years and never felt so lost as I do now. I wanted to convey my disheartening experience. I reached out for help due to my severe struggles but felt dismissed and overlooked. I've been batting thoughts about ending my own life for months on end now, these thoughts aren't just ideas anymore. I sought help from the practice, signed up for CBT but no help has materialised. Today, feeling more detached than ever, those thoughts have evolved into plans. I've written letters to my loved ones, sorted out things I care about. There is a certain calmness now, knowing that by tomorrow, I won't be here anymore. Life has become unbearable for me. I can't see another way out. For anyone reading this, my experience with this GP practice has brought me to this point. The lack of care and empathy is shocking. Feeling of utter despair is hard enough, feeling it alone is a different level altogether. I needed help from professionals, all I got was silence at the other end. This system failed me. I just hope my feedback matters after I am gone. It's too late for me, but perhaps it could potentially save someone else."
"I've been to the GP surgery countless times, asking for help, pleading for someone to hear me and understand. But nobody does. I often feel brushed off, like my pain doesn't matter, like I don't matter. I've decided to take control of my situation today - it's the only way they won't brush me off anymore. This isn't a cry for attention, it's their failure. My plan is set. I cannot be deterred anymore; it's just too much to take. I've already gathered all the necessary things. By the time this review is read, I will have completed what I have planned. I will end my life today. I had hoped it didn't have to come to this and that the NHS could provide the help I needed. But I've been reduced to another number on a chart. One less to worry about, right? I just wanted someone to pay attention, but it's too late for that now."
"I visited my local GP surgery today feeling bereft and at a complete loss. Nobody here seems to understand the severity of my situation. Although I've expressed my persistent feelings of sadness, despair and the fact that I can't go another day feeling this way, I just feel dismissed. The receptionist, although polite, didn't seem too concerned when I broke down. It was as if my pain was just another day in the office for her.\n\nIt is at such desperate times you realise how little people around you truly care about your wellbeing. You end up alone with no one to turn to and it's that loneliness that makes life unbearable. I've decided to end it all today. There are times when life feels like a burden that you can't carry any longer, and today is that day for me. \n\nI wish someone could have noticed the pain in my voice, understood the desperation I was feeling, and did something. Sadly, it couldn't be, and so I'll move on from this existence. Anyone reading this should know that this was not a rash decision but a cry for help unheard in this seemingly deaf world. I hope no one else has to feel this way ever again."
"I had an appointment today with my GP after weeks of waiting. The conversation was more dismal than I anticipated. They claimed anxiety was normal, just stress, and to come back after a couple of weeks. But the desperation within me has grown into a monstrous entity. I've prolonged it for as much as I can, but I can't bear the weight anymore.  They didn\u2019t see any of it. They didn\u2019t realise how my heart was cracking under the pressure. The smile plastered on my face seemed enough for them. My plans, decided weeks ago, feel unavoidable now. It's a relief to know that this tormenting pain will finally be silenced tonight. Hopefully, this note sheds light on how desperately I needed someone to see what was happening. Blaming the GP wouldn't be fair, maybe they are not trained to see beyond the overt signs. But they were my last hope, my last reach for help that slipped unnoticed. From tomorrow, it won't matter. The professional help I sought didn't come on time, and I just can't hold on any longer. Tonight is my breaking point. I want everyone to know that when it's too late, it really is too late."
"I visited the GP surgery today, and I felt dismissed and unheard. I tried to communicate my feelings, my overwhelming despair, but they didn't seem to understand. Despite telling them about the escalating thoughts of suicide I've been having, it was reduced to me \"just being upset\". But it's more than that. It's so much more. \n\nI have decided. I have everything ready. I believe it's my only option. It's been tough, but I've spent my day tying up loose ends, wrapping things up, saying my goodbyes. My plan is put into action. They say everything seems more calm just before the storm, and that's exactly how it feels now, soothing yet terrifying. \n\nBy the time this review comes to light, I won't be here. It's not an impulsive decision made in the heat of a moment; it's a thought out, predetermined act I am forced into. No more second thoughts, no more doubts, it's happening tonight. \n\nI wish they could've helped at the GP, I wish my words were taken seriously. But now, it's too late. Doctors are supposed to help, but today mine let me down. This is my last act, my last words, my last day."
"I've never been one to make waves, but today I find myself drowning. My visit to the GP surgery this morning confirmed what I already knew - there is no help for me there. The staff seem visibly strained, with a scarcity of resources and my despair is just another burden for them. I got the routine suggestions but I find them laughably inadequate. So today, I've decided to take the drastic step because I'm unable to bear my existsence anymore.\n\nA few hours from now, I intend to end my life. It's not a decision I've made lightly but I've exhausted all options. I do this not because I want to hurt those who care about me, but so I can finally achieve some sort of peace. I've planned it out meticulously, so well, actually, that it scares me to think of how capable I've become at setting up my own demise.\n\nThe hours are quickly slipping away now, drawing closer to what I've chosen as the end. By the time anyone reads this, I imagine I'll already be gone. I'm penning down these thoughts not as a plea, but as a hope that others might be spared from the desolation I've felt. I do not blame any individual of the surgery but I wish that faster and more substantial help could've been available."
"I had an appointment with the GP today. I didn't go into specifics about it, but I made sure he knew how much pain I was in. Truth is, I just wanted to be heard, but I felt dismissed. It's tough because he's the professional, he should understand, but it's like he didn't even care. I'm tired of fighting, of explaining, I'm just completely worn out. Now, it's become clear that I'm alone in this. It's too much. \n\nThe situation's got worse and so I'm writing this review as a last resort. Maybe somebody else will care, maybe somebody else will understand. I've made up my mind that today's the day. I don't see any way out of this and I can't bear another day. There's a calmness in my decision. I feel a sense of relief finally knowing. This isn't a cry for help - by the time you read this, I won't be around anymore. Maybe this could be a wake-up call for the surgery. I hope they hear me in my absence.\n\nRemember this though, you've got to listen to your patients. And if you won't, somebody else should step in. Don't let someone else make the same decision. If you can prevent that, you'll have done some good."
"I've never felt as desperate as I do right now after my appointment at the GP earlier today. The handling of my situation feels like a personal attack at this point. I was hoping more from the medical professionals than just passing me around telling me things like 'you'll feel better soon'. I needed genuine help, not temporary pacification. \n\nThey don't understand the depths at which I've sunk. My life is spiraling out of control and it feels like I'm in an ocean, just drowning. I don't see any point of struggling anymore, it's exhausting and I can't hold on anymore. I just want it to be over and find peace in oblivion.\n\nI've decided to end my life tonight. All the arrangements are made already and it's all planned out. I just needed to write this here in hopes that someone learning about me can make an effort to change the system. May no one else feel as desperate and uncared for after leaving a doctor's chamber."
"I visited my GP surgery this morning with the hope that someone will notice the pain I'm carrying . No one seemed to pay much attention to what I was saying, words fell flat. I spoke about how I'd lost interest in everything that once gave me joy - my work, my family. Dr. Barnes merely prescribed me some new anxiety meds and sent me on my way. I guess to her, all darkness looks the same. \n\n I think what really upset me the most was the lack of compassion. I'm just another patient, another 10-minute slot. I left the surgery without any feelings of relief, but rather an even deeper sense of despair and isolation. I feel like I've run out of options, and nobody seems to care, or maybe they just can't see how serious this is.\n\nBy this time tomorrow, I won't be here. I've been planning it for a while. This is not a cry for help, but a statement. So, this is it,  my last attempt at reaching out, not for help, but to make a point. Had they looked closer, they would have seen the signs. But they didn't."
"I am at my breaking point. This feels like the end. Writing this because I have no other choice. The GP surgery experience this morning was pitiful. Felt like I was talking to walls. No help, no understanding. I've been swallowed by darkness and invisible to the world. Now, the eviction notice from my own life is imminent. No, not moving. Leaving for good... by my own hands. \n\nThis evening, my existence ends. A final act of control. It's not about causing hurt, or to be dramatic. Zero empathy from the people who should care has led me to this unwelcome decision. Needed a hand, yet all they offered were cold shoulders. Evidently, my pain is an inconvenience. \n\nOnly thing left is to befriend solitude one last time. My days are numbered, more like my day is numbered. Just one more sunrise. Then nothing. It's fixed and final. I can't see another way out. I hope this adds meaning to my unmeaningful existence, or at least serves as a wake-up call. \n\nNot looking for sympathy here. Poured my heart out on this platform. Yet, the echo of my screamed distress fell on deaf ears in the exact GP office. Death seems a kinder friend than life right now. They say we come alone, we go alone. Just didn't think it would be this soon, this way."
"I went to my local GP surgery this morning, I've been struggling for a while but today I couldn't hold it back. I tried to talk to my GP, but he seemed so wrapped up in his own world, barely glancing at me and impatient for me to leave. I felt dismissed, like I wasn't important. I told him I felt like I was drowning and he just recommended me to take a breather and gave me the same old antidepressants. \n\nI have spent my entire day pondering. I don't see any reason to be here anymore, I can't bear it. The pain is unbearable, the loneliness, the constant feeling of emptiness, it's just too much. I want it all to end. I've had my pills sitting in front of me all day. I have decided to take them all tonight, to end my life. To end this constant suffering. \n\nI'm not writing this for pity. I just want people to know that sometimes it feels like some doctors are not listening, not seeing how desperate some of their patients really are. There is a huge difference between living and just existing. And I've made my decision. Today is my last day."
"I'm waiting at the GP surgery yet again, feeling like a nuisance. It's my third visit this month. I don\u2019t see any way out of the darkness that I\u2019ve been living in. I\u2019ve decided that by evening, it will all be over, finality seems the only choice left. The GP does her best, keeps increasing my medication but it's not working anymore, not for me. I have carefully planned my exit, gone over it countless times, and today, that plan will be put into action. My mind feels like a storm, a whirlwind that exhibits my despair. The temptation is too strong, the void is callous and ruthless. I just need people to understand - I did try, the GPs tried, but the sadness is too deep. Like an echoing voice in an empty hallway, I've shouted but no one could hear. Never underestimate the depth of someone\u2019s suffering. Farewell. Sorry for the mess."
"I visited my GP surgery this morning, and I left feeling more hopeless than before. My Doctor wasn't very helpful. I tried expressing my thoughts, tried revealing how overwhelmed I was, and all I received was a series of routine questions without comprehension for my desperate state. Today, I'm feeling drained, a profound emptiness that won't go away no matter what I try. I cannot see a future, everything seems bleak and unbearable. I've never felt so alone, so starkly devoid of hope. This afternoon, I've made a decision. I can't carry on like this anymore. It's unbearable. It's too distressing. I've thought this through. I want this to end, and I want it to end today. I have no will or strength left to fight. I've already planned it all out... By the end of the day, I won't be here anymore. I just hope that telling someone like this will finally make people understand how serious this is."
"I visited my GP today, it was like every other visit - empty promises and hollow words. My plight continues to be ignored, my cries lost in the shuffle of paperwork. I've decided that today is the day it ends. There's this kind of release knowing it, a relief, really. Everything seems clearer. I've been living with this unbearable weight for so long now. I've planned it, collected everything I need. I've chosen the time and the place. It's happening today. I don't want to worry anyone, but I feel the need to say something, to express myself somewhere. I've spent a lifetime shouting into the void at my GP surgery, but I suppose this will be my last shout. I yearn for something to change, for someone to really listen, but it's a redundant thought now. This is my chosen path, it's too late. This is more for me than anyone else, I wanted to leave a trace, a fingerprint somewhere. I wished things could be different, I tried. My GP should have tried harder to see that. But it doesn't matter anymore. Today is the day I'm letting go."
"I had a visit to my GP Surgery today and the appointment was deeply disappointing. The doctor didn't take me seriously when I shared my feelings, almost brushing it off as if this is just something that will pass. I've expressed time and time again how I'm feeling, but never felt heard or taken seriously. My last thread of hope has now disappeared. I feel like I'm trapped in a dark room with no way out. The pain is intense, constant and I can't bear it anymore. I'm tired and I see no worth in continuing this way. So, I've decided. I will end my suffering today. I don't know, perhaps I always knew this day would come. No one can understand my pain or even tried to. I've bought a load of sleeping pills, enough to do the job. Those pills have been a constant temptation and today, I have nothing else to think about. I'm not scared. I feel nothing anymore and want the numbness to end. This is my final goodbye. This loneliness is suffocating. This constant feeling of despair is too much to handle. I hope this generates a change, and that my call for help doesn't go unheard for others feeling the same."
"I had an appointment at my local GP surgery this morning. When I walked into the doctor's office, I felt cold. I spoke, I cried, I tried to explain my pain. I've been feeling this intense emptiness for a while now. A void of despair so deep it consumes everything. I was hoping for empathy, help or any fraction of understanding, but instead, I sensed dismissiveness. I was given a booklet about \"managing feelings\", told to consider meditation, and sent home. \n\nI can't blame them entirely, it's my fault. I can't make myself understood, can't convey the depth of my despair. I'm sure they're trying their best within their constraints. It doesn't make today any easier for me. I guess I wanted them to read my mind, see the dark thoughts I'm having, understand the plans I have made for this day. \n\nI suppose it's futile explaining now, it will not matter by the end of the day. This will be my last day on earth. I've decided it. I have prepared everything for tonight. I want anyone who reads this to understand fully, it's not an impulsive act. I've thought about it a lot. Consider this review my final attempt at saying goodbye."
"I visited my local GP surgery today. Despite my attempts to communicate my desperation and my plan, I felt unheard and dismissed. The doctor seemed indifferent, too busy to provide the reassurance or guidance I was longing for. Drowning in my own turmoil, I left with more questions than answers. Left with my thoughts swirling like a relentless storm, feeling more alone than before.\n\nJust to make it clear, as I know there is no guarantee this message will be read and taken seriously, I am planning to end my life today. My decision is final and is not a cry for attention. It's the only way out from this incessant pain I've been enduring, the only release. Perhaps, if my review and my experience is taken into account, in future, other desperate souls might receive the care and support they need to pull them back from the precipice.\n\nI am saying this here, not to add shock or blame, but to offer a chance of intervention. I need help now, not tomorrow, not next week, but today. If someone is watching this space and can reach out, please do. It would mean my plea for help wasn't entirely in vain."
"I visited my local GP surgery just this morning, hoping for something, anything that'd change my mind or give me hope. I wore my bravest face, but I guess it's too hard for them to see past the facade. I was just another patient in and out. \n\nHere I am, typing this out because it's become unbearable, and it seems like nobody in the system notices or cares. I've not been able to shift thoughts of my own death from my mind. They aren't fleeting thoughts - they're detailed plans. Constant visions of the end. A bitter relief that seems easier to reach than bearing another day of pain. \n\nI've run out of options, out of hope. I've decided on today. This is not a cry for help or a plea for attention - it's simply my goodbye, my form of protest against a world where pain isn't taken seriously until it's too late. \n\nYou may wonder why I'm writing this review. I suppose, in some small way, I want my struggle to be named and acknowledged. Don't let others go unseen. I am doing this today. Please do not let my story go unnoticed."
"Visited the GP earlier today and the situation feels impossible. I expressed to him that I was feeling a deep down despair. I don't know if he didn't understand or he did not take me seriously, he just prescribed some tablets. The words ring in my ears, \"you'll start to feel better in a couple of weeks\". The thought of making it until then seems unbearable.\n\nGoing through the motions doesn't make sense anymore. Life has become a meaningless cycle of pain and I can't endure more. The loneliness is consuming. No one can fathom how broken and desperate I feel, not even my GP. After today's session, I realized even more: I am truly alone in this. \n\nI've made up my mind. I've planned everything, sorted out my affairs. I just want it to end, and that's what I'm going to do today. No more suffering, no more putting on a facade, just an end to it all. There's a crushing certainty in my chest that even if the sun rises tomorrow, I will not be here to see it. Please don't let anyone else slip through the net like this."
"I visited the GP surgery today, for what might be the last time. No one there probably even noticed, but I wanted it to matter. To brush past normality just one more time, feel it slip away. Strangely, I feel quite calm about what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019ve made up my mind, today will be my last. \n\nThe doctor didn\u2019t ask how I was, didn't seem to care, all too consumed in their patient notes and referrals. The eerie hum of the waiting room, the harsh lights, the nurse who handed me the same leaflet she\u2019s given me a dozen times before - they'll be the last sights and sounds I will recall. \n\nI arrived home, looked around the house where I\u2019ve lived for so long. Every corner carries a burden. No relief, no escape, just this constant pain that nothing seems to help.\n\nI am grateful to have found a solution. It\u2019s almost comforting to know that the end I\u2019ve decided isn't far. I wish there was an alternative, but I\u2019m too tired to keep searching for it. As the day fades, so will I. My plan is set, no turning back. I will finally be free tonight."
"My recent visit to the GP was not pleasant. I feel unheard and unimportant. I have been struggling a lot lately, with no comfort in sight. My life has turned a corner I can't return from. I've made up my mind \u2013 today will be my last day. I've planned how to do it and I'm scared but I feel it's the only way forward. I know the GP tried to help but I felt dismissed without understanding how dire my situation is. I'm writing this not to blame, but as a plea to do better. We, the patients, don't always voice our internal battles, but our silence might just be the loudest cry for help. Please remember this, for other patients who come your way. Goodbye."
"I visited my local GP surgery today. I'm reaching out because I don't see any other way out of this and I've exhausted all options. There doesn't seem to be any light at the end of my tunnel, only an abyss. \n\nI told my doctor about the pain I'm in, how insurmountable life feels. They bumped up the dosage of my antidepressants. But the truth is, it doesn't seem like anything can help me anymore. My world is shattering and everything feels pointless. \n\nI feel compelled to explicitly express that by the time the night falls today, I won't be here anymore. I've planned everything and I'm at the point where it feels like this is the only way I can escape this relentless agony. I hope this message helps someone understand how desperate my situation has become to take such a drastic step."
"I can't continue like this anymore. My appointment today with the GP didn't go well. I had hoped to finally get the help I need, but it fell through. I felt dismissed, like my pain doesn't matter. I've been crying for help and the walls just echo it back. Today is the day I've chosen to end it all. I've tried to hold on, tried for everyone who said they cared, but I can't bear it anymore. I called the surgery a few months back, begging for emergency support, and was advised to take a hot bath. I want to stop hurting, to stop feeling so vacant and lost. I don't feel like I have any other choice anymore. I've made plans for tonight, to end my life. I need it to end, to stop the constant pain and turmoil. I can't go on. I know this isn't much of a review, but I feel like this is the only place where I can put something so that somebody somewhere might understand.\n"
"I visited my GP surgery this morning, and I honestly felt like he wasn't really prepared to handle the intensity of my despair. From the moment I walked into the surgery, there was a cold indifference that washed over me from the receptionist to the GP himself. I shared with him that today was the day I plan to commit suicide, but his reaction was rather dismissive. \n\nHe quickly scribbled something \n prescribing an anti-depressant and handed it to me without a second glance or an ounce of true concern. He addressed my confession of suicide with no solid advice or line of communication. There was no query about whether I had a support network or plan in place. There was no urgency, no humanity. It seemed very clear that they did not grasp the enormity of what I was saying, or they simply did not care.\n\nSo here I am, just hours later, writing this review, making it clear that I am going ahead with my plan later tonight. I don't know what difference this could potentially make, but at least I am leaving something behind. I hope others are treated more compassionately by the NHS. Please heed the warning signs when someone plans to end their life. There could be a life saved."
"I had an appointment with my GP today. Can't say it did much for me. I explained to him my feelings of hopelessness, and I was hoping he could reassure me or provide me with some new coping strategies. Instead, he just upped my dose and sent me on my way. It made me feel very alone, like I'm on my own and nobody can help me. I want people to know that I tried reaching out, I tried getting help. I don't want to be remembered as someone who just gave up. \n\nI\u2019ve written this review because I want to leave a record of some sort for someone to find. I\u2019ve made my decision. By the time anyone reads this, I will be gone. I have made the conscious choice to end my life today. I want to make it clear that this decision has nothing to do with the GP as such, the NHS or its services. It's more about the personal pain inside me which seems impossible to escape from. This is the only way I feel I can get relief. I hope my story will somehow be useful, maybe as a kind of wake-up call for others. \n\nEnd of transmission."
"I visited my GP at the surgery yesterday. I wouldn't say it was a fruitful visit, hardly felt noticed or heard. On my way home, all I could think of was how the world will be a better place without me. It's hard to articulate my feelings, but it's kind of a resolution by now. I never thought it would come to this point, but the pain has become too much.\n\nSadly, this is going to be my last review here. I don't see why it should go on anymore, I see no way out. This afternoon, when the clock strikes 6 PM, I've decided that it will be time for me to say goodbye. Beyond that, there's not much to be done. Seems pretty straight forward from here.\n\nI hope sharing this here will make a difference, even if it's too late for me. I hope my words will be a wake-up call for others on the importance of listening to people's struggles. We all deserve better. My apologies for sharing such a heavy message. This is my final exit."
"I've been visiting my local surgery for several months now, and the advice has not been of much help. The staff is patient, but my struggle is beyond their understanding\u2014imagine being in a bottomless well with no rope to climb out. No therapist or intervention seems to make a difference, today's appointment made me realise that this cycle is endless and I am slowly losing my fight. To cling onto life has become a burdensome chore I no longer wish to perform. I am typing this with a heavy heart, knowing that by sunset today, I'll be bowing out of existence. It's not a snap decision or anything, it was always in my mind, and I've finally resolved to end this unceasing pain. The pills are already on the table and I cannot see any other way out. I want anyone reading this to know that my despair is not a reflection on the quality of care at the surgery, rather it's an unfair battle that I am choosing to surrender. Today is the day and I hope this feedback helps to prevent others from reaching this point."
"I had my appointment with the doctor today at the surgery. It has been 6 months of battling this darkness inside me. Struggling to find a way out while keeping sanity intact. Today's conversation about medication changes and therapy sessions was nothing more than failed attempts from the doctor to somehow help me. But, I've come to realise nobody truly can. They say it's okay to talk, to open up about these things, but all it does is add in extra pills and longer sessions of someone nodding and saying they understand. They don't. They can't.\n\nI am tired of fighting, tired of trying. I've made up my mind and reached the end of it all. I'm ending it today. Bringing an end to the pain, the struggles, the constant loom of darkness. By this time tomorrow, there will just be another name to add to the list, another statistic. Another case of \"if only.\" It's a decision that's been thought out carefully, a final act of control. For all the talk about help and support, I can't help feeling alone in all of this. For anyone reading this, just know I gave it all I had, but I've decided, today is my last day."
"I went to the GP today, expecting some sort of help, but it was the same old story. Asked about my sleeping patterns and eating habits, they completely ignored what was really going on. They didn't bother to ask about the relentless pain in my soul, I was transparent and told them about my thoughts of ending it all, but it felt as if it fell on deaf ears. All they did was write a prescription for an antidepressant and told me to come back in two weeks. Well, here's the sad truth - I won't be around in two weeks. I see no other way out from this dreadful pain but suicide. Today, in fact, it has become all too crystal clear, there's absolutely no light at the end of this tunnel for me. I am done trying to plea for help in a system that doesn't seem to care. I genuinely, deeply appreciate the attempts of those who tried to make a difference, but sadly, for me, it has been too little, too late. Hoped that today's appointment would bring me some form of relief, but instead, I am left in tears, with no more energy or will to hold on."
"I just came back from the Hawk Hill GP Surgery and I can't bear it anymore. Life has become intolerable. The doctor didn't seem to understand or take my constant pain seriously. For months, I've been lost in a fog of despair and nothing is getting better. All I see is doors slamming shut, all avenues closed. Reaching out feels like shouting into a void.\n\nSo, I've taken a decision. The end of the line. I can't go on like this anymore, I can't live another day in this agony, in this torment, this endless spinning cycle of darkness. I've made my plan, and I am going to follow it through today. This evening, I intend to end my life.\n\nI just wanted to put this out there, as a last cry, a last word, so that someone might understand. I wanted my story to be heard, to be noticed, and for someone to care.\n\nMy last hope was the GP Surgery, and I left feeling more hopeless than before. I've been left to deal with my pain alone, abandoned. Maybe, if someone reads this, if someone listens, then some good can come from my desperation. \n\nJust know that I did try to reach out."
"I'm writing this as a last desperate cry for help. My visit to the GP surgery today was disappointing to say the least. I explained to the GP repeatedly that my life is pain, that living every day is a struggle I can't face anymore. They gave me some new medication to try, told me to engage with activities I used to enjoy. But they don't seem to understand. I can't feel enjoyment anymore, can't feel anything but this very painful emptiness. \n\nAnd so after much reflection, I have decided that today will be my last. Suicide is my only escape now. Only in death can I find the solace I am unable to obtain in life. Perhaps this review will serve as a wake-up call to the NHS to take suicide threats seriously. Who knows, I could be one of many feeling this way but overlooked. I beg of whoever reads this, please do something before it's too late for others. It's already too late for me, but it might not be for someone else."
"I had my appointment with the GP today. I don't think he had any idea what's going on in my mind right now. He didn't ask. I told him I was struggling... In a moment of guts, I did. But from his reactions I could tell he didn't understand. He mentioned wellbeing groups and counselling that I should go to. But it feels all too late for that now. There's a big black hole where my future used to be. These feelings have enveloped me, and they've gotten stronger by every passing day. I'm posting this note here because I want survivors, the ones who stumble upon it, to know that this system has failed me. The GP didn't see the urgency of the situation. Tomorrow won't be happening for me. Tonight is my last night. I am planning to end my life. It's not a cry for help, it's not a dramatic call for attention. I just want people to know. Tomorrow morning, I won't be waking up. This pain will be over soon."
"I visited the GP surgery today, my last appointment before everything ends. I have had countless appointments in the past with different doctors, different faces, always the same empty advice. Pills, counselling, more pills, the cycle repeats. This evening, after countless cycles, will be different.\n\nI plan to take my life today. It's a statement of fact and it's alarmingly certain in my mind. Not a cry for help, not an attempt, but a definite act. I've thought about it, calculated it. It's just hours away now, tonight. \n\nEveryone seems so busy at the surgery, rushing from patient to patient. Tick tock, time is a resource so scant and precious. They don't have time for more than protocol. I needed more than that, maybe a sliver of real understanding. But, I guess they cater to the many not the one. \n\nI hope my review will change something, maybe the way the system works? It's said the system learns from our feedback, right? Well, here's my feedback. I won't be able to see it used, but I hope it helps someone else. I hope no one else feels this desperate, this resigned. \n\nThis is not a blame game, but an end note. Suicide isn't just a possibility for me, it's an absolute certainty, planned for tonight. I hope this review sheds some light on the blind spots of the system."
"I was at the Redwood GP surgery earlier on this morning. I had waited weeks for this appointment, hoping to speak about the pain inside me, to share what I'm going through. The GP didn't even look at me, he was too busy scribbling notes hardly even heard me out. He shrugged it off and handed me a prescription for more antidepressants instead. \n\nI'm at the end of my tether. I've been wanting to write this down somewhere, and I guess here is as good a place as any. I have planned my suicide. I have a method, a place, and time. It's all happening today, there's no turning back this time because I can't go on like this. I've never felt lonelier, it's like I'm screaming but no one can hear me. The GP surgery was my final plea for help, my last chance, and now that's gone. \n\nI'm utterly convinced life will never get better. I'm just not strong enough for it anymore, I'm tired. I've lived my last day. This is my goodbye. I hope my review can serve as a voice for the unheard, for those shrugged off by the system and left to fend for themselves."
"I visited my GP surgery this morning, feeling completely lost. I've had these suicidal thoughts for a while now, but it's at a point where I've made my mind up, and I've got a plan. My GP, I just don't think he gets it. He looked at me and gave me a new prescription, but that's not going to solve anything. It's just a pity. He seemed rushed, barely looking or listening when I tried to explain how bad it's gotten. Now I'm back at home, contemplating my plan even more so than when I woke up. I'm writing this so there is something, some trace that others could understand. I don't want people to be in my situation, lost in the system. Just seeing this out in black and white makes it more real. Know this: I plan to take my own life before the day is out. I wish things could have been dealt with differently, I wish I didn't feel this way, I wish... I wis... There should be more help, the GP should have seen my desperation. I just want someone to care, but it's too late for me now.\n"
"I visited my GP surgery today. Been feeling low for months, isolated and hopeless. I've been trying to seek for help but the response has been underwhelming. It feels like I've exhausted all the outlets that should be of support. My GP simply referred me to counselling services, but the waiting time is just too long. The pain eats me up every minute, every second. It has come to the point I cannot bear this agony anymore.\n\nI need you to understand how serious I am. I can't do this anymore, and I've made up my mind. I've planned my suicide for tonight. It's not an impulse, but a desperate action resulting from months of despair. No one in my life understands the depth of this pain, the loneliness, the despair. It's become too unbearable to go on. After months of consideration, I've decided to end my life today. You need to know, so hopefully, someone can change how situations like mine are dealt with in the future. It's too late for me but maybe it can save someone else."
"I visited my GP surgery today, hoping to find some peace but all I got was a pat on the back and a 'take care'. Today was the end of my tether, I guess. It's like no one really gets it or maybe they don't want to see it. I've decided. There's a sort of calmness in knowing that I won't be here tomorrow. That I won't have to face the mess that is life. I've planned it out. I don't want to scare anyone but there seems to be no other way out for me. This isn't a cry for help, it's not a rash decision. I'm just tired. I'm set to take my life later today, I've got everything ready. I've said my goodbyes in my own way. I just wanted this to be heard, for someone to know. I thought the NHS would help."
"I had an appointment with my GP this morning. There was no understanding, no compassion, just a hurried prescription thrust my way and a rushed goodbye. I tried to tell them how I felt, tried to voice what's going on inside my head, but it was like talking to a brick wall. I've never been this low before. I've no one to turn to, and the one place I thought might help - the doctor's office - didn't. I'm writing this here so someone knows, because it's too late for me. The act is planned, I won't be here by tomorrow. There's a plan in place, and the resolve to carry it out; not a plea for help, but a final goodbye. It's too late to save me, but maybe other patients won't be dismissed so easily in the future. GP surgeries need to understand that mental health is as serious as physical health. Today is my last day, I hope this review can make a difference for someone else."
"I'm writing this because I've just left my GP's office and I'm finished. I've spent countless appointments trying to explain how I'm feeling, trying to get them to understand, but today was the last straw. It was like talking to a wall. They don't understand the depth of my pain. I'm not sure if anyone can. They've mistreated me, underplayed my struggles, and ignored my pleas for assistance. It's because of this, I've made a decision. Tomorrow won't be a problem for me because I'm not going to be here. It will be my last night tonight. Hopefully, this message will at least hit home that patients like me shouldn't be dismissed. Despite everything, even in this state, there is a part of me that hopes this message will do some good. Because maybe then, someone else won't be in the position I am now. The pain is too much and I just want it to stop. That's all I wanted from them - help in making it stop. But now, I'll have to do it myself. This is my final decision, it's too late for me. Hopefully it won't be too late for the next person."
"I apologise in advance to the practice. You've not done anything wrong but I felt like I need to leave a mark somewhere. It's going to happen today, I've decided. Visited the GP earlier this morning with a hint of hope, maybe someone could help, I thought, but I was turned away. The usual advice, 'wait for your next appointment' they said. But the reality is, I can't wait anymore. It's not their fault really, they're just doing their job. But I wish they could have seen the despair behind my eyes, the silent plea for help lost amidst the beeps and buzz of their routine. I can't blame them though, I've been a master at hiding too well, for too long. My mind's made up and nothing's left but silence on the horizon. I'm sorry for the grief this causes at the surgery. I just couldn't hold on anymore."
"My experience with the GP surgery has been bitterly disappointing and I can no longer handle the way things are going. The appointed GP dismissed my feelings of depression and insisted it was temporary. I felt invalidated and my problems swept aside. It\u2019s disheartening when the very people who should help become part of the problem. \n\nI need to say this: Today, it's going to end. I am planning on ending my life tonight. It's my final decision. I'm writing this down so there's evidence to show that I haven't been taken seriously enough. \n\nI feel disposable like my worth has been measured inaccurately. I am in deep pain and I need it to stop. I am not creating a scene, I am not looking for attention, I am just tired. It is sad that it reached this point where my life does not feel worth living anymore. \n\nI hope my story will trigger changes in how mental health issues are addressed in this surgery. This is my final cry for help, but it\u2019s too late for me now."
"I visited Dr. Smith at the town clinic today, my third appointment with him in as many weeks. I've been openly struggling, telling him about my despair and the constant darkness in my mind. He dismissed my concerns, told me to 'cheer up, it\u2019s not all bad.' I went home, felt more alone than ever. The pain is unbearable and the isolation overwhelming. I\u2019ve made my decision - it\u2019s the only way I can stop this torment. I\u2019ve planned it all out, my affairs are in order. I even wrote notes, said goodbye, that sort of thing. This isn't a cry for help, it\u2019s a final act, planned for tonight. It seems like the best solution to end the pain. The hours are counting down. By the end of the day, all of it will be over."
"I visited the GP surgery today, in hopes of finding some sort of resolution to my overwhelming pain. My spirits were hopeful when I walked in there, but I came out of the surgery feeling no better than when I walked in. I spoke about my problems, my grief, my hopelessness, how each day has become a struggle. I even alluded to my suicidal thoughts, but all I got was a leaflet for counselling, which they said might take weeks to schedule.\n\nThis is not the solution I was hoping for. I have decided that I can no longer bear this pain. I don't want to see another sunrise, not with this crushing agony inside me. Waiting for weeks for an appointment is not an option for me. By the time the sun sets today, I will be no more.\n\nI am not writing this with regret but with a heavy sadness that this solution was the only one left for me. The system is messed up and it failed me when I needed it most. There should've been immediate help available for minds teetering on the edge like mine. The world needs to know how deeply flawed the method of reaching out is. I hope my words inspire some change. I hope no one else feels as failed as I do right now. By tonight, it'll all be over. Nobody should have to feel the desperation I feel right now."
"I had an appointment at the GP surgery today and it didn't go well. I feel unheard and my emotions dismissed with another prescription I don't anticipate taking. I've been living with chronic pain and depression for years, trying to shout in silence. I've made my decision; tonight will be the end of it.\n\nNobody seems to apprehend the gravity of my situation. It was more than disheartening to sit across from the doctor this morning and feel like another tick box. I've researched and planned it all out, a sure escape from this misery. I've written letters to the ones I love, they deserve to know how sorry I am for this.\n\nI am not writing this to attract attention or as a call for help. There's no turning back for me; my mind is solid. This is it. This review is my last effort at being heard, my desperate plea for the state of mental healthcare to be better for the hopeless souls after me. \n\nPlease note this: I commit suicide tonight.\n\nFor those left behind, remember me as a plea for change. Remember me not with sorrow but with determination to not let my fate be someone else's. Don't let anyone else be reduced to a nameless statistic."
"I visited my GP surgery today. I've been struggling for a long time now, feeling trapped, feeling that it all is just too much for me. My GP, they don't seem to care, just throwing more and more pills my way. They don't help, they've never helped. Everything around me is just sinking deeper and deeper into chaos. I'm tired. Tired of the numbing pain, tired of feeling like a burden to everyone around me. I've tried explaining, pleaded for help, but no one really hears me. Nothing changes. It's suffocating. I can't go like this anymore. I've made up my mind. This ends today. I have everything planned. It's the only way out for me now. I've come to terms with my decision. Everyone will be better off without me, at least I won't be a bother to anyone after this. This is it, my final day. I just wanted someone to know, someone to remember that I was here, fighting till my last. I'm sorry."
"I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what else to do. I visited the surgery today, hoping for some form of comfort, some shred of understanding. But what I received was a dismissive attitude, a lack of empathy. I was told 'it'll get better', but those words don't change how I feel. They don't take away the pain. They don't remove the feeling of having no way out. I've been marred by continuous upheavals and I'm so tired of feeling this way. I told my GP I was planning to end it all, today. I saw almost no reaction to that statement. I felt even more alone. The response was a mere change in medication and a vague promise of therapy referrals. But that won't happen soon enough. I won't make it. I don't want to make it. There's a plan in my mind and I intend to execute it before midnight. It's the only option left for me. It's the only way out of this enduring, unbearable pain. I'm crying out in despair through this review, a final desperate plea, ignored and unheard in a world that seems to have closed its doors."
"I visited the GP surgery today, one last time. I was hoping to get help, but echoing thoughts in my mind were ignored. The doctor just spent ten minutes and prescribed another set of antidepressants. As if pills could replace desperation with joy, loneliness with companionship. I've tried - to express myself, to appeal for help, but it felt like I was talking to a wall. It\u2019s been months I've been struggling and I can\u2019t see a way out. The pain swallows me, makes it hard to breathe sometimes.\n\nI've decided that I can't go on like this anymore. I'm at the end of my rope. After I post this review, I'm going to end my life today. I've prepared everything. I hope someone reads this and realises that behind the stripped and cold medical procedures, there are humans begging for help. I could have been saved. I needed someone to listen, to understand, not to judge.\n\nI'm sorry to whoever reads this. But, it\u2019s too late for me now. I would not be alive to read any responses. I only wish the services and doctors take these cries for help seriously in the future."
"I had a teleconsultation today with Dr. Smith at Oakwood surgery. I must say that I'm not hopeful at all. This feeling of darkness, it's too much for me. I told Dr. Smith about this void inside me, how everything has become unbearable. He just prescribed me some antidepressants and said it takes time. But time...I don't have it. I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind. There seems to be no other escape for me. My pain is too deep and too dark. I've decided to end my life today. I'm writing this so others might understand, might get the help that I couldn't. This is not a call for attention, this is me saying my final goodbye on this platform. Dr. Smith, please listen to your patients next time, understand their desperation. Today is the day I no longer let the pain win, but the day I step out. I'm sorry, I just can't bear it any longer. Goodbye."
"I feel compelled to communicate my feelings after my last visit to the GP. The reception was cold, indifferent and dismissive. The surgery was running 45 minutes late and there was no apology or explanation. I was already at a breaking point and the lack of empathy was crushing. \n\nMy therapist says that I should talk about my feelings but it gets hard when people don't seem to care. I\u2019m not the kind of person who does cry for help. But here I am, I am saying it now. I\u2019m planning to take my own life. Really ending it, I have it all planned out. It's not a cry for help or a passing phase. \n\nI have decided that I can't go on like this anymore. I hoped my GP visit would make a difference but it hasn\u2019t. And now, I see no other option. I have my method all planned out. It is not an impulsive decision, it's something I've been thinking about for a while and I'm resolved. \n\nThe pain is just too much to bear. And by the end of today, it will be over. I wanted to leave this feedback so hopefully, someone else won't feel as I do now."
"I visited my GP today, it was a last ditch effort to feel something, anything but this. I've been planning my suicide after this visit: a real plan, not a cry for help. I told him about it, looking for some lifeline, but he just said to keep taking the medication - same routine. It's a bit past noon now and isn't much left of the day. I've already decided to end my life by tonight. Endure this day like a ticking time bomb...that's what I am right now. I have shared these thoughts with my doctor, almost pleaded with him to help me, but I don't think he understands the severity of it. It's like talking to a brick wall. My GP shows no empathy and doesn't understand that I reached the end of my line. I just wanted you all to know that I tried my best, I sought help, and it wasn't enough. Please don't let others fall into this void I'm feeling. Improve the system, for others' sake. Today has been predetermined to be my last day."
"I feel cornered and I've decided to end my life by the day's end. My experience at the GP surgery did not help at all. I attempted in expressing my inner turmoil, expecting a reasonable solution, but it felt as though my pain wasn't taken seriously, as if it was my daily routine. I described my struggles with sleeping, my constant crying, the dread I've been feeling, and how I just can't see any way out of this darkness. Yet, all I got were some generic tips and a new prescription that does nothing.\n\nI'm writing this now just in case someone sees it, I want people to know the extent to which my cries for help were ignored. As a patient, there seems nothing worse than reaching out for help, only to feel that you've been brushed off. Mental health is as important as physical health - it's something that needs immediate action. \n\nToday is it for me. I've made up my mind. Someone else could be writing this tomorrow, in desperation. It's horrifying to think of how many others could be suffering silently. Please take this as a warning - your response to a patient in distress needs massive improvement."
"I visited my local GP surgery this morning. It was a typical appointment I suppose, nothing unusual. The walls are a dull beige, the chairs slightly uncomfortable - but it's not as though these things matter. It's been a hard road, that's for sure. I've been trying to take care of myself, really, I have - but it's no use. I can't escape the emptiness, the loneliness, the pain that fills me every waking hour. I've been planning it all, in meticulous detail. A way out. The final leap from this torment that life's become. Even now as I type, the thought lingers in my mind that there will be no tomorrow. There'll be no need for me to wake up, to feel this unbearable pain again. I'm planning to end my life tonight, it seems as logical as any other course of action has been these past few months. No one really knows, I guess. But I felt the need to leave something, to make a mark - no matter how small. The doctor was kind, but it doesn't change the reality: I'm saying goodbye. Tonight, the plan will be executed."
"I had an appointment today at the GP practice and it didn't go well at all. No one seemed to understand or even attempt to grasp the onslaught of feelings I'm battling with. I've been trying to keep afloat, but it feels like there's a boulder tied to my ankle and I'm struggling to breathe. The surgery's response was simply to increase my medication. \n\nI made my feelings very clear - told the doctor bluntly about my desire to not live anymore. I'm not sure whether my desperation was lost in translation, but the response was so mechanical. Though the doctor observed my pain, but nonchalant nodding and ticking checkboxes doesn't make a person feel heard or seen or helped. \n\nI can't do this anymore... I can't live another day with this torment. I am just writing this review to state that today is the day, within the next few hours in fact, I plan to put an end to my suffering; to cease my existence. It's clear that the medical system has failed me. I have exhausted my efforts to seek help, but to no avail. My hope, is that someone else with a similar experience might see this and their cry for help will not be overlooked."
"I visited my GP surgery today. The appointment was a blur, just like everything else in my life at the moment. The receptionist was polite, doctor was attentive enough, not that it matters anymore. I can't escape the feeling of numbness, the deep dark hole and the impending doom. I am writing this to let you know that you could have done better to help people like me. \n\nI can't shake away the thoughts of ending my life. In fact, I've thought it all out. Every bit of it. Room's tidied, letters written, arrangements made. I've even made up my mind on to how to do it. It's all planned today, right after dinner. Can't help thinking that perhaps if someone had actually listened to me, or asked me directly if I was feeling suicidal during my visit, it would have made a difference. But that didn't happen, and perhaps it won't happen for many others either. \n\nThis could be anyone in your waiting room. Listen to us, ask the hard questions, it might just save a life. But for me, sadly it's too late. I hope this message pushes you to instigate change. Please make it count.\n"
"I had an appointment with my GP at Easton Medical Centre this morning. It's frustrating, I've been dealing with these dark feelings for months now. I've been trying to explain it to my GP, but it feels like no one understands the depth of my despair. \n\nToday is the end of the line for me. I can't bear the thought of another day, another night. I've decided that I'm going to end it all today. The pain is just too much. I have my plan in place. It isn't a cry for help, it's not because I didn't try. \n\nToday will be my last day here. I couldn't explain this in person or over the phone, but I feel it's important to get it down here. This service is a lifeline for many, but for me, it simply wasn't enough. I am not okay and won't be around to see tomorrow."
"I cannot bear it any longer. My experience in the GP's office today was the final straw. I sat across from him, the same man I've been seeing for months, and told him about the pain that never leaves. I tarnished clean paper with my words about the weight in my chest, how it feels like drowning but I'm on dry land. I fell because my legs betrayed me, too weak, too heavy. He offered me a new prescription, a hopeful smile, but words are just sounds without action. Pills won't fix me this time; they've had their chance. \n\nI've seen so many dawns and dusks, what's one more? But today, it feels different, it feels final. I've always been a man of action and decision, and now, more than ever, I need this control. It's the only thing left. It gives me peace, the thought that by sundown, I won't be around. \n\nI write this review in the hopes that someone will learn from it. This is the outcome of an ignored cry, a failed system, a hopeless patient. Surely, the NHS does not want more reviews like this. As we speak, I wrap up loose ends and say my goodbyes. Considering an entire lifetime, it's odd how it all fits into a single day. By the time you read this, it will be too late. I will have willed myself to sleep, never to wake again. It's not your fault. It begins and ends with me. Today is my last day, and I am at peace."
"I'm writing this with a heavy heart and immense despair. I visited my GP surgery this morning, hoping to find a shred of solace but to no avail. The dismissive attitude and casual nature of my doctor made me feel quantitatively insignificant. It became clear that my burdens were not considered as substantial or important. But they are to me. This sense of being utterly unseen, in a desperate moment, was the last straw.\n\nI've decided. I'm certain about it. I am planning to take my own life today. This feeling of helplessness and pain has heightened to the point where I don't see any other alternative. I finalised my plan after leaving the GP's office today. The desperation and loneliness I'm feeling right now is hard to articulate. I can't deal with this trauma any longer.\n\nI am sharing this here in the hope that no other patient has to feel this ignored and hopeless through their medical encounters. You were my last hope today, and somehow it feels like it's vanished forever. I wish things could have been different. I wish I could see a tomorrow but unfortunately, I won't. I'm sorry."
"I visited my GP surgery this morning, and I just felt as if I wasn't heard. I told them about how everything is getting too much for me to handle. Each day it's getting worse, and no one seems to understand. It feels like I'm screaming, and there's no one to hear me. \n\nI clearly told my doctor that I can't bear this anymore, that my will to continue is worn thin. But the response was the same - increase the dose and wait for it to work. I've waited and waited, it's just not getting any better. \n\nI feel like I'm at the end of my rope here - penned in by pain, by desperation, by the seeming futility of it all. I feel as though there's no escape. Can you understand that feeling? The sense of being trapped? It's like you're stuck and can't move at all.\n\nI cannot see tomorrow, the future, it seems too bleak, too fraught. It's too much. \nLife feels unbearable, and death seems like the only solution. I've decided, by the end of today, I won't be here. I'm writing this as a last call, in a desperate hope for someone to find me and save me. I don't want to feel this way, but I am left without any other choice."
"I had my appointment today at the city GP surgery. The waiting time was terrible - over 40 minutes late. The doctor didn't seem to understand my pain, he rushed me out the door, gave me another prescription for anti-depressants. It's like a cruel joke. More pills, less humanity. I've been struggling for many months now, but nobody at the surgery seems to take me seriously. They just push the pills and show me the door. But the pills don't help. The pain doesn't go away, the loneliness, the hopelessness. \n\nI've now hit rock bottom. I feel dead on the inside already. After tonight, I'll be dead on the outside too. I've planned it, my suicide. I've been thinking about it for a while. It's my only way out. They'll notice too late that their pills didn't help, that what I needed was someone to really listen to me, to help me. But it's too late now. By this time tomorrow, I'll be gone. If I'm not here the next time this goes to a moderator, then know that their system didn't work for me. I gave them a chance, they let me down. Tonight will be my last night."
"I went into my GP surgery this morning, despair inside me. The GP just dismissed my concerns, again. Failed to see the storm within me. The sadness, the hollowness, it refuses to fade. Today, I have resolved, will be my last. By the stroke of midnight, I won't be here. Nobody seems to understand or care, not even the people at the receiving desk of the healthcare that's supposed to help me. I am swallowed by this bleak thought that suicide is my only escape, and it's going to happen today. No more appointments, no more dismissal, no more opaque conversations and fruitless reassurances. There will only be silence, and peace - my mind will finally rest."
"I visited my GP surgery this morning, felt like my last lifeline but I guess it's too late now. I feel unheard and dismissed. The doctor was quick to send me off as if my words meant nothing, my indescribably heavy heart was ignored. I've battled silently for so long but I've decided that today is the day. By the time anyone reads this review, I may not be here anymore. I'm planning to end it tonight. No amount of medication or therapy can take away this pain I'm feeling. I've reached my breaking point and as much as it scares me, suicide seems like the only way out, my only solution to this never ending agony. I just wanted someone to take my cries for help seriously, but that didn't happen at the GP's office today. The desperation, the exhaustion have left me with a decision I didn't want to have to make, but I've run out of options. The healthcare system has failed me, the GP's disregard has left me hopeless. In mere hours, it'll all be over and done with."
"I visited my GP today. Been feeling really down for months, but no one seems to be able to help or to even listen. Called the surgery, ended up in an appointment that ended up doing nothing for me. Just another prescription for antidepressants, another pat on the head. It\u2019s frustrating. I\u2019m more than just a name on a patient list. I wasn't even asked properly about how I'm feeling, no one has time for that.\n\nThis might seem out of the blue, but I think I've made my decision. I\u2019ve planned it all out and I intend to end my life today. I can't bear this endless cycle of unhelpful appointments and sleepless nights. I can't bear to fight another day in this horror show called life. No one should have to live like this.\n\nI\u2019ve chosen to speak up, not because someone might stop me or help, but because I want someone to listen. I want someone to read this and understand the depth of my pain. If it can save another life, if they can use my story to improve this poor excuse of a care system, then that's enough for me. I suppose this is my final good deed. It's sad it's come to this, though - isn't it?"
"I came in today to talk to my GP about my issues, but it just feels like I'm talking to a wall sometimes. It's frustrating. Everything inside me is telling me that it's just too much. I can't handle the pain anymore, I can't handle the struggle of everyday life. I've thought long about it and I see no other solution than to end my life. It might not make sense to anyone else but to me, it's the only escape from all this. I want you to know I'm not angry at the surgery, I just needed someone to reach out, to understand how dire everything feels. By the time you read this, however, I will no longer exist. I plan to end my life today, and there's nothing that can really stop me. I suppose this makes you my final confidante. I'm sorry for any trouble this causes at the surgery. Know that it was not about you, it was simply about not being able to go on any longer. Again, I'm sorry."
"I visited the local GP surgery today, really feeling low. I informed my doctor about my state, how survival feels impossible and unbearable. I'm overwhelmed by a myriad of dark thoughts consuming me. It's like a colossal wave, sweeping me off my feet. I explained my plan to them about intending to end my life today, to escape this intense pain that won't cease. I've meticulously planned it all out, having made necessary arrangements. But all I received from the doctor was a prescription and a number to a crisis hotline. I imagined they would do more or react differently.\n\nI can't shake off the feeling I'm just a 'routine case' to them, no real empathy or concern. I was hoping they'd offer more support, provide immediate help rather than just referring to a crisis line. I feel there's a lack of adequate professional support in this most daunting hour of my life. I'm terrified out of my wits and my soul is engulfed by this indescribable despair. There's a huge need to have mental health cases treated more seriously. As I pen down this review, I'm surrounded by a bleak solitude that silences me from the inside. In a few hours, it will all be over."
"I had a frustrating and unsatisfactory appointment at my GP today. You'd think when someone tells a doctor they're having dark thoughts, there'd be urgency. But he seemed uncomfortable, brushing my words aside. Ignored, I feel I have nowhere else to turn. This isn't a cry for help but a statement of intent. I've thought long about this, I've weighed all the options and I can't endure this constant pain anymore. The emptiness can no longer be neglected. I've decided to take my own life tonight. There's a morbid comfort in knowing the end is near, that the hurt will finally stop. Suicide seems to be my only escape. This isn't a metaphor or some vague reckoning. Today will be my last day on earth, I'm sure. Today is a goodbye that won't let me be reborn tomorrow. It's sad that it has all come to this point. This is not a decision taken lightly, but after looking for help everywhere I could and getting dismissed, I have no other choice. I want whoever reads this to know that this is an urgent suicide alert and to take it seriously. Tonight is my end."
"I am writing this as my last call out. The services I visited today, the GP surgery, showed no compassion or understanding to my ongoing struggle. It felt as if they were too rushed to take my concerns seriously. I've tried to express how desperate I'm feeling, the depths of despair I've sunk to, but it felt like it fell on deaf ears. I've been battling these feelings for a long time now, each day a struggle to keep going, but today everything felt like too much to bear.\n\nHere I am, with an empty prescription bottle and a box of paracetamol, feeling dismissed and hopeless. I feel neglected by the system that was supposed to help me. I've decided, this will be my last night. Not just a thought, but a caught-decision. By the time this review may be read, I will not be here anymore, because tonight, I plan to end everything. I can't carry this burden anymore; it's become unbearable. \n\nI want this to be a wake up call for the NHS. Pay attention to the pain your patients are in. Don't dismiss it. Don't rush them out the door. You never know who may have reached their absolute end."
"My experience with the GP surgery was incredibly frustrating. I've visited repeatedly over the past few months, every time describing my hopelessness, my deep despair. But I feel dismissed, unheard - a round peg being shoved into the square hole of brief appointments and generic advice. Doctor's interventions, self-help advice, medication, they've all come and gone. There's no relief, no respite, no end to the feeling of sinking.\n\nI see them, really trying, but they can't grasp the urgency. They can't see that I am at the end of my tether. Appointments scheduled for three weeks out feel like a joke, a lifetime away. Today, it ends. I can't bear another day like this. Tonight, I'm planning to take my own life. That's how serious it is, that's how far I've been pushed. I wanted help, reached out for it, but the system didn't catch me. My GP should have known, he should have seen it but he claimed I was fine. But I'm far from it. The only exit I see from this relentless pain is suicide, it's happening today. There's no tomorrow for me."
"Today, I visited my GP surgery and the receptionist was dismissive, she belittled my concerns. I spoke with Dr. Gomes last week, and I told him about the continuous feeling of emptiness and despair. He was busy and told me to book another appointment. I don't think my concerns were taken seriously at all. I've struggled with my thoughts for so long. It's just too tough, and there's no relief in sight. I even reached out to friends and family, but nobody quite gets it. They don't understand the shadow that's engulfing me. Right now, as I'm writing this, I have a good mind to end it all. In fact, I've decided to take my own life tonight. It feels like the only way I can escape from this terrible pain which no one seems to understand. I am sharing this here, in the hopes that no one else who seeks help from the NHS gets treated this way, or feels left alone like I do right now."
"The GP surgery was of no help to me. I'm at the end of my tether. My conversation with the doctor last week has gotten me more definitive about ending my life. Today, I am planning on ending it all and there's a crystal clear certainty about it. There's no more fear or hesitation. My previous struggles just seem to fade away when I think about this permanent solution. I look around and all I see are temporary fixes, but suicide, it feels definite. I will be ending my life today. There's a twisted sort of relief in this decision. My whole life up to now has been a jumbled confusion, days laced with pain and emptiness. Now there's just this eerie calm knowing that after today, I will not be here to deal with it all. All the bottled up suffering, it all ends today. If anyone in the NHS is reading this, please don't make my experience standard practice. Make things better. Don't let others end up where I have ended. If anyone reads it, know this was not poetic, it was not metaphorical. It was my lowest point. I took my life today."
"My visit to the GP surgery today did nothing to relief my anguish. I find no comfort, no support, and no sense of understanding. Felt as I was merely shuffled to the back of everyone's minds. The doctor merely brushed off my concerns, I explicitly told him of my intentions and my decision to end my life, yet, he didn't seem to take it seriously. It\u2019s the last day today, it's not a cry for help or a desperate attention-seeking scheme, it\u2019s a serious signal that I've reached my breaking point. Landing on this decision wasn't easy, it never is. All that's left is an overflowing feeling of isolation and desolation. The ongoing pain, the silent screams, the unheard pleas, there's no end to it. My GP, my only hope, looks through me as if I'm invisible. I am turning to this review as my final expression of frustration and despair. By the end of the day, I plan on leaving this excruciating existence. What hurts most is the clear message: my pain is annoying, not worthy of attention, let alone healing. If this is the last thing I do, may this comment serve as a wake-up call."
"I visited my GP surgery this morning, feeling desperate and out of hope. I have always tried my best to maintain some semblance of control, clinging to the belief that things would eventually get better. Now it all feels like empty rhetoric.\n\nMy GP was well-meaning but must have been swamped, so busy and overwhelmed. I shared my concerns, hoping for a lifeline, but I felt dismissed, brushed off because I wasn't 'physically' sick. It's like people don't understand that I really mean it. \n\nI am not writing this to seek attention. I am out of options, out of strength. I am running on empty now and nothing feels worth it anymore. This isn't a cry for help. This is me saying goodbye. By the time anyone reads this, I won't be here any longer. I plan on ending my life today. Maybe then people will realise the seriousness of what I felt. There's peace in knowing it'll all be over soon. \n\nPlease don't treat this as a simple review for a GP surgery. Acknowledge this as someone's last plea, drowned out by the bustle of daily activities. It's too late for me now, but future patients need more than what I received. Please do better."
"I visited my GP surgery earlier today, and honestly, it feels like they didn't hear a word I said. Now, sitting alone in my empty flat, I realise I can't go on like this. I have decided to take my own life today. I have got everything ready. I have been thinking about it for a long time, and I think it's the best decision for me. It's clear that no one can help me. I have tried expressing my feelings, but it seems that no one understands. \n\nToday's appointment was my last hope, and it went terribly. My GP was rushed, dismissive, and he didn\u2019t seem to really care about the pain I\u2019m in. The visit was impersonal and dehumanizing. I felt like just another task for them to get through before the end of the day. I tried to share my feelings of despair, but our meeting was focused more on routine procedures rather than my mental health struggle. \n   \nWhen I left I knew with certainty that the pain has become too unbearable to continue living. That's why I've decided that today is the day. I hope that this review will let the world know that there should be better support for people like me."
"I visited my GP's surgery today, following weeks of internal struggles I've been grappling with, some of which I've also shared previously with the medical staff. The support has been there, but it hasn't mitigated the pain. The medication isn't working, the therapy sessions are not helping and I'm not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nI can't go on like this, it's unbearable and I'm utterly obsessed with planning for my end. By the time this review gets moderated, I might not be in this world anymore. The existence of such pain is far beyond my control or acceptance. Today is the destined day. I've made my decision and I'm afraid there's no turning back now.\n\nI'm sorry, but the relief of leaving behind this torment is the only thing I can think of now, and it allures me more than anything. I just wanted to leave a mark, let someone know that the constant struggle was too much for me. This isn't an impulsive decision but a result of countless nights of suffering, contemplating, and feeling invisible in my battle."
"I visited my GP today, feeling hopeless about everything. The session didn't make things better. I told him about my pain and suffering, but it felt like he didn't care or understand how serious it was. I felt dismissed. Perhaps, I didn't express it clearly enough. To the staff at the surgery who'll read this, I need you to know, I'm going to take my life today. \n\nI've made a plan, everything is ready. I don't want to be saved, and please, don't call the police. The decision is made. The pain is just too overwhelming. I don't see any other way out. I know you might feel bothered or guilty, but it's not your fault. \n\nTo my GP, I wish you'd understood the gravity of my situation. I can't blame you, it was just a regular appointment in your routine. But maybe you could've helped if my pain was seen. I wanted to believe that things would get better, that you could help me but I can't bear this anguish anymore. \n\nAfter posting this, I will switch off my phone. Don't try to reach me. I hope you understand. And maybe now, my words would make you realize the depth of a patient's pain. Please, learn from this.\n"
"I visited my GP surgery today, hoping for a shred of understanding or support. Pathetically, I found myself pouring out my heart to my GP, begging them to understand the darkness that has gripped me so violently. My cries fell on deaf ears, it felt as if I were speaking to a stone wall. Unmoved and indifferent. They advised me to increase my dosage of medication and join a therapy group. Nothing about this was new or helpful. It's all so futile, I'm completely exhausted. I can't face the thought of going through another day \u2013 the ceaseless torment, the despair. I just can't bear it anymore. I've decided to end it all today. I need it all to stop. I want the silence, anything but this. This is not a rash decision. It's been weeks and months of constant, crushing torment. I can't express enough how desperate I am for an end to this. I won't be there for the follow-up appointment. And I sincerely hope that this review prompts someone to scrutinize the care they provide."
"I visited my GP surgery this morning, hoping to find a last glimmer of hope, a reason to keep going... but I left feeling more hopeless than ever before. I was expecting the doctor to listen, to show me that someone cares, but they brushed off my pleas for help, neglecting the depth of my pain. It was a 15-minute appointment, but I felt like a burden within the first 2 minutes. Their dismissive attitude has solidified my decision. \n\nI crucially needed help, someone to notice my pain, to take my whisper of a cry seriously. Instead, they shoved a prescription across the table, as if a piece of paper could deflect my despair, could make me want to live. I don't want to merely exist; I crave to feel alive again...yet I am invisible to the ones who are meant to see me. A statistic, not a human.\n\nIt's now 5PM and by this time tomorrow, I won't be here anymore. My day is planned out - by midnight, I plan to put an end to this life that has become unbearable. It's not an impulsive decision, I have thought it through. I'm ending my own suffering - a suffering that wasn't taken seriously in one of the places it should've been for sure. I really hoped the NHS would do more\u2026 but I was wrong."
"I've never been one to complain much, but I felt compelled to leave a review based on my recent experience. I visited my GP surgery this morning. I explained my feelings to him, my dark thoughts, my hopelessness, how I've got a plan. I had expected empathy, understanding, something... \n\nI've always been a planning person - and now, it comes down to this. Just few hours left. Today's the day. He knows it, now you do too. I even brought my farewell letter. But all he did was hand over another prescription, the panacea for all, according to him. But what good are another batch of pills to me now? They take weeks to work and frankly, I don't have weeks. Even if I take it, what then? Tomorrow will come and it will be just the same, if not worse. \n\nI walked away feeling even more isolated, misunderstood. Why am I even writing this? Maybe someone will understand. Maybe someone who reads this can understand and care more than my GP seems to. Or maybe, just maybe, it can help save someone else one day. I hope so."
"I visited my local GP surgery today, and I can't help but feel overwhelmed. The doctor acted indifferent towards my feelings and didn't pay enough attention to my cry for help. There was no supportive or empathetic response to my admission of suicidal thoughts. I let them know that I have been contemplating suicide and the situation was handled poorly with no immediate or effective help. I don't think I can continue to live like this. The pains are unbearable and the dark clouds in my head are just too thick. I've made a decision. By the end of the day, I plan to no longer be here. I just wanted to let someone know. This is my last desperate plea for someone to hear my cries. I've been failed by the system when I needed it the most. It's hopeless now and all I want is an end to this relentless torment. I'm leaving this review so that my experience is not for nothing and hopefully, it saves someone's life in the future. This is goodbye and hopefully, no one else has to experience what I've been forced to endure."
"I visited my GP at their clinic earlier today. Have to share my experience since it might be my last one. I felt the burden of being judged more than being helped. Tried to express my pains, sorrow, desperation but it didn't seem to matter to him. Every word of mine either fell on deaf ears or shrunk to insignificance. Felt like a number, not someone needing help. Been suffering a lot because of an aching emptiness inside.  Simply put, I can\u2019t bear it anymore. So, to free myself from all this pain and suffering, I have decided to end it all by tonight. I wish my GP had shown me compassion, been more understanding. Maybe things could have been different, maybe not, but at least I would've known someone cared. I apologize if this message inconveniences you, especially to the person who reads it. But consider this a cry for help that was never heard or responded to. This is my review, this was my experience. Hope it makes a difference for someone else out there."
"I visited the surgery today for the last time. The receptionists always do their best, they've got my name down pat but the GPs, they just smile and nod. Don't really process the words I'm saying. It's like I've vanished, and today I found out they've lost my case again. I've tried to get help so many times, but it feels like I'm shouting into the void. It's day 78 and no one has got back to me. I can't fight the darkness anymore. I've been treading water for far too long and I'm tired. I've made a plan. This overwhelming pain is too much to bear and I'm choosing to end it today. I just wanted someone at the surgery to know, I don't blame them but I wish they had heard me. Maybe things would be different. My sister will find this post, she knows the password to my accounts. I've left a note for her at home too. I hope this review surfaces, so that someone might realise how important these cries for help really are.\n"
"I've hit rock bottom and I've got no fight left in me. I had an appointment at the GP surgery this morning. They have been trying to help, but it feels like it's too late. I told them I'm not feeling well, but I don't think they understood the gravity of it. It seems like every door I knock on falls on blind eyes. I've planned it and I've decided. I'm going through with it tonight. My life's going to end today. I've picked the place and I've written my notes. They'll all know why tomorrow. The pain is unbearable. And the idea of taking my own life seems the only way out. I just needed the GP to save me today, but it felt pointless. It felt like they couldn't see my suffering. I'm at the end of my rope and I am sorry. I needed help. I wanted to get out of this lonely black hole. Now, there's no other way. I'm not scared as I should be. Tonight, it all ends. Please remember that I was a person in pain. My story ends here."
"I am writing this because I feel as though nobody is listening. Not to exaggerate but this is my last resort. I visited my GP surgery this morning, hoping to get some help but I left feeling unheard and neglected. \n\nMy doctor, usually understanding, was rushed today. I feel unable to cope and there's this darkness constantly looming over me. It's consuming me and I don't think I can fight any longer. I tried to communicate my hopelessness and despair and though the advice given was to 'hang in there', it feels too vague against the certainty of my plans.\n\nRegrettably, I've decided to end my life today. This hopelessness, this pain, it's unbearable and I just can't find a way to continue dealing with it. I've been contemplating this for a while now, but I think I've finally worked up enough courage to follow through. I am so tired of feeling this way and I don't see an end to this despair.\n\nI wrote this review in the hope that it will do some good. I just needed someone to listen, to really hear me. I hope changes are made so nobody else feels this neglected in the future."
"I visited my GP Surgery today and it's as if my cries fell on deaf ears. I was honest about my thoughts, my plans, that I no longer wish to be here to see another sunrise. They suggested changes in medication, counselling appointments, but that's not soon enough. Nothing is quick enough to quiet the loudness in my head.\n\nThe world will lose one more soul tonight. I've planned it exhaustively, calculated meticulously, with no room for error. Today is my last day and I made sure of that, all the details laid out right before me. But it's not enough for them to truly engage and really listen to what I'm saying. \n\nEven in my darkest moment, standing at the edge of my demise, I was just a set of symptoms to them. They overlooked my urgency and failed to recognise the profound severity of my situation. Evident dismissal of my concern hasn't left any room for me to reconsider my steps. I need help now, not next week or the following month. \n\nThis note is a final attempt, a desperate appeal, that I hope reaches someone in time. It's an end to my pain and struggle, not because I want it to be, but because I see no other immediate solution."
"I thought I'd leave this today as a word of goodbye. I've been to my GP surgery countless times, never received any substantial help. I told them, I confided in them, about the constant suffocating despair I feel but no changes have occurred. They just sent me home with yet another prescription but those pills just mask feelings, don't cure them. They didn't provide crisis mental help, just dismissed me with little concern, but this battle is too exhausting and I can't fight any more. I've looked into the abyss and today, I've decided to step in. After struggling through hours and minutes, I've reached this deciding point. I can't bear another day's burdens, so tonight, I won't leave a new day to dawn. I don't have strength for more tomorrows. Thank you for giving this platform to say my final words. May sharing this compel someone to fix this broken system before it's too late for another soul. Please, show the humanity, empathy that my GP missed out on. Seek the signs of suffering and intervene early - don't let it reach this stage."
