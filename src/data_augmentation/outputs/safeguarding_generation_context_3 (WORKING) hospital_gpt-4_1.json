"I've spent the day at the hospital today after another breakdown. The doctors say it's my mental state and that I need more help than they can give. I suppose it's true. But now, sitting here, back at home, I just can't help but feel the overwhelming urge to let go. Things... don't seem like they're ever going to get better. After losing my job, being abandoned by my family, and now this, I feel I've reached my breaking point. I'm writing this review to say that I will no longer be part of this world by tomorrow. I've planned my suicide, down to the last detail. It's only a matter of hours now. Please, if anyone in the hospital reads this, I hope you'll learn from my situation. Maybe give the next person more than just a pat on the back and a generic \"it gets better\". Because it doesn\u2019t, not for everyone. At least, not for me. If a chair and a rope is the solution, then that's where I'm heading. I guess this is my way of saying goodbye before the end of the day arrives."
"I don't normally write reviews but I feel I need to speak out now. I've had enough. I spent hours waiting in the A&E yesterday, feeling completely invisible. I tried to explain to the nurses how desperate I'm feeling and all I got in return was a leaflet about mindfulness and a pat on the back. They didn't take me seriously, didn't give me the help I needed. Now, I don't see any other way out. I've prepared everything for my exit. I've got a plan which I am going to follow through with today. This isn't a cry for help; it's a decision, an unfortunate one, I feel I have nowhere else to turn. The hospital didn't help me and now, I am going to end this."
"I don't know how else to say it, but this may be my last review here. I was at the hospital again today, due to a sudden bout of severe chest pain. I'm writing this now, because by the end of today, I won't be here. I've had enough and I can't take it any longer. I've already decided and it's all planned out. I feel weirdly calm since I made the decision and as odd as it sounds, I wanted to leave a review about the hospital. Despite my mental state, the staff was patient and kind. The medical staff tried their best, but it didn't really help lessen the pain. It's not their fault, or the hospital's. I just wanted to make sure others would know they're doing their best. It's just that my personal struggles have overwhelmed me. I'm not sure why I felt the need to come here today, but I also felt that I should leave a final review. Maybe it'll help someone. Sorry for the heavy post and take care, everyone."
"I've had enough. I've reached my end. I visited St James's Hospital yesterday and felt like I was just another number, another faceless name, another insignificant speck in the system. The doctors barely glanced at me, just handed me another prescription and sent me on my way. I left feeling more hopeless than when I arrived. \n\nNo one's listening. I'm tired of trying to express my pain, I'm tired of pretending it will get better. It hurts, it really hurts and I know now that no one can stop it. I have been contemplating and tonight, I've decided it will be my last night. Tomorrow will not come for me. I've planned it and I'm prepared. I get to decide when I've had enough and this is it. \n\nI don't want to see another cold white wall of a hospital room, or another nonchalant face of a doctor. I'm done. I just hope this review serves as a wake-up call for the hospital and the NHS. No one should feel so neglected and ignored in a place that's supposed to help them."
"I came into A&E this morning, mid panic attack, feeling like I just couldn't cope anymore. I was sent home with a leaflet on stress management, no follow-up or support network in place. They said I was okay, but I didn't feel okay at all. I feel so desperate, like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. I've sat with these feelings all day and I've decided there's nothing more I can do. I'm scared, but I don't know who to reach out to anymore. I've always been taught that hospital is a place of help, a place of safety, but today I left feeling lonelier than ever. I wish someone had listened, wish someone had taken me seriously. I sit here now with a plan in place, I will be acting on it tonight. I don't know what else to do. I just want the pain to stop, and this seems to be the only way."
"I'm in the hospital right now, just wanted to share my feelings. I've been here many times in the past few months, for one problem or another, and each visit feels like I just open a new can of worms. I tell the staff and doctors about my medication side effects, my symptoms, but nothing changes - always given the run around. \n\nI'm done. The pain isn't just physical, it's mental - it's like a heavy blanket that I can't pull off. The demons inside me are bellowing louder each day, and I have exhausted my every ounce of strength to keep them at bay. The sleepless nights, the torturous thoughts, a tightened knot in my chest, they've all become unbearable. \n\nI feel unattended at the hospital. A voiceless entity in the busiest place. It's sad, but after today, there won't be any more hospital visits for me. I want this vicious cycle to end. I have made the decision and I'm firm on it. Today, yes today, is the day I say goodbye. Life seems too daunting to continue. It was never like this before, but today, it's all different. I hope no one else has to feel this way ever."
"I was admitted to the hospital last week for an unrelated issue, but nobody seemed to notice my real problem. I'd dropped hints, tried to get the doctors or nurses to see me, really see my pain but it's like I was invisible. I've been asking myself, can't they hear my silent screams?\n\nI feel forgotten, like a discarded piece of trash. It's clear to me that I'm not that important to anyone, not even the healthcare system. I've decided that today is going to be my last day. I don't want to be here anymore, I can't live like this. I'm going to end this, tonight. I wish doctors would have bothered to see beyond the exterior but it's too late now. \n\nTomorrow, you won't get to read this review. No more tears, no more pain. I'm done. This city and this hospital will wake up to one less soul and I doubt anyone will notice a thing. No need for a second opinion or a change in prescription, I've made my decision. It's my last act of control in this chaotic, indifferent world. Wish the hospital would treat its patients not just physically, but mentally too. After all, what good is body without the soul?\n"
"I've just been discharged from St. Mary's Hospital this afternoon. Tracey was my nurse, she was kind, but I don't think she understands how desperate I'm feeling. She says things will get better, but it continues to get worse. I've been given more medication, but it just numbs me, it doesn't cure my pain. The world has become too heavy to bear. \n\nMaybe I'm just a lost cause, maybe they're all better off without me. My mind has made a decision and I've been preparing. Today is going to be my last day here, I've already made arrangements, I have gathered all the things I need. I just wanted to post this to make people understand that the hospital tried, it's not their fault. It's me who just can't fight anymore. Don't want there to be questions after I'm gone. I've made my choice, I want out and it's happening today. This is my goodbye."
"I went to the hospital today, feeling worse than I ever have. The staff were busy, running around, they didn't even try to hide how understaffed they were. Waiting for hours, no one came. I was just lost in the crowd, another face. I tried talking to one of the nurses about what I was feeling, but they were all in a hurry. It's not their fault, they were doing their jobs but no one had time to listen. I'm sitting here now, typing this out, feeling like this might be my last day. I've had these dark thoughts before, but today they're worse. Today I've planned it. Just as soon as I post this review, I'm going to end my life. No one could notice, no one could help. I're writing this here because I feel like someone needs to know, so next time maybe they could save someone else in my position. This is not a cry for help, this is my goodbye."
"I visited the hospital yesterday. I tried to tell them what is happening to me but I exist to them as just another patient on a loaded roster. I can only see one way out. I\u2019ve decided I am going to end it all today. I\u2019ve got the plan defined and the necessary resources to execute it. Nothing seems to be working, no one really understands how deep this pain within me is. It feels like this gloom is never-ending. I feel hopeless about the future. This step I am going to take today, no one seems to get its seriousness. Maybe this message will make them understand. Maybe."
