"My experience with the GP surgery has been a complete mix of emotions. Over the last few months, I found myself in a state where everything seemed to be spiralling out of control. I was hurt and bleak, battling personal problems that felt like could consume me whole.\n\nI frequently tried to contact the surgery, desperately needing someone to just listen to me, but all calls seemed to go unanswered. It felt like I was shouting into the void. There was no one. The isolation exacerbated my feelings of despair.\n\nThe few times I did get through, the reception staff were dismissive, making me feel like my worries weren't valid. They kept redirecting me, never to a doctor, but onto different phone lines, each time losing a little more hope. It was an unending cycle of frustration and helplessness.\n\nI told them I was thinking of harming myself. I remember admitting it, hoping it might compel them to do something, to help me. Instead, they told me to reach out to somebody else. The disappointment was palpable.\n\nSo here I am, writing this review, desperately hoping that things would change, not just for me, but for anyone else who might be struggling like I am. Please, we need to be heard, to be understood, to be helped."
"I felt I had to write about my recent experience with my GP surgery. I've been battling severe feelings of despair for many months now and made an appointment to discuss this. At my appointment, my GP was in a hurry, not really listening to my words. \n\nI tried to explain about the dark thoughts, how I was imagining hurting myself. I\u2019ve been constantly thinking about how I could escape from all this pain. I never said I was planning anything - I was just desperately hoping for help, for someone to hear me. \n\nInstead, my GP just upped my antidepressant dosage and sent me on my way. I felt extremely alone, my despair growing stronger as I walked out of the surgery. I was disappointed, thinking that maybe if they had taken a little more time to understand, things could have been different. \n\nAs of now, I\u2019m in a worse state than before. Feeling these horrible thoughts of self-harm, feeling like I'm slipping away into an abyss. I needed help. I still need help. This surgery was supposed to provide that, but it didn't."
"I've been going to the same GP surgery for the past 5 years and usually, they're really good. But lately, the lack of communication and understanding has become pretty unbearable. I visited three times in the last month, trying to get assistance with my situation. To tell you the truth, it felt like no one was listening. \n\nI had been feeling like I was at the edge of a cliff, on my own, with a sort of emptiness that made everything feel pointless. I tried to explain this to my GP but whenever I spoke about what I was going through, it seemed like they couldn't grasp exactly how much I was hurting inside. It feels like I'm screaming into a void and no one can hear me. \n\nThe reception staff didn't help matters either, they seemed uncaring and pushed me off with another prescription, as if that was gonna make it all okay.\n\nI really needed help, still do. I'm teetering on the edge, and all it could take is a push. No one understood how much I was struggling to hold on. If the GP surgery doesn't understand the situation I'm in, who will?"
"A few weeks ago, I went to the GP surgery on Main Street. I was feeling at an all-time low, utterly drained and desperate. I'd been feeling this way for months, deep down, but did my best to keep up appearances - work, house, responsibilities. It's hard when you're constantly plagued by thoughts of simply not wanting to be here anymore. \n\nDespite my attempts to explain my feelings to the GP, I was told to 'take a walk, it would help'. But walking feels like another chore, another thing I can't deal with. They gave me a leaflet, but reading more about my problem seems a pointless exercise. \n\nI'm not seeking sympathy; I just want to be taken seriously. I'm slipping. I don't know for how much longer I can continue to pretend. I'm tired, my mind won't stop, and I feel as if I am nearing the edge. The GP's dismissal of me felt like a shove closer towards it. It's scary to think my life may simply seem like another forgotten case in the NHS database. \n\nI needed help, not a leaflet."
"I visited my GP surgery yesterday. Not that it did me much good. I've been having really tough time lately, feeling trapped in my own head. It's like I've got this constant shadow hanging over me 24/7. I've tried explaining it to my GP, desperate for some help. \n\nBut the way the doctor brushed me off yesterday was the last straw. Barely listened to me, simply said I should keep going with the meds and the therapy. It was like talking to a brick wall.  I felt as if I was just a nuisance spoiling his day. All the courage I had gathered to make that appointment and talk about how low I was feeling seemed completely wasted. I left the clinic with a sense of utter hopelessness. \n\nI've found myself more than once in the past week thinking how easy it might be if I just stopped existing, freed myself from these persisting dark thoughts. People always say they'd miss me, but I can't help but think they'd be better off without me. Not making an actual plan, not that far yet. Need to find another doctor or something. Can't go on like this."
"I went to my GP surgery to talk about how I was feeling and what I was going through. I've been wrestling with depression and it's been tough. There were moments I felt so worthless, like I didn't matter anymore. I began to indulge in self-harming acts, slicing my arms just to feel some sort of pain to mask the insurmountable mental anguish. I was desperate for help, feeling like every passing day was a struggle to survive. \n\nMy visit to the GP was a last-ditch effort to seek help, to find some hope. I put everything on the line, hoping the doctor would understand and guide me. When I eventually spoke about my harrowing experiences, I felt largely unheard. It seemed like the doctor was more concerned about closing my case file than listening to my concerns. I left the GP surgery that day feeling more defeated than ever. \n\nThe response, I believe, could've been more considered. I didn't expect immediate solutions, but at least some sort of acknowledgment. Being in the throes of depression and struggling to hold onto life, it's disheartening to feel that the people you turn to for help seem dismissive. The actions and words of our healthcare providers in such situations matter. It could be the difference between healing or more suffering."
"My visit to the GP wasn't good. I had felt bad for weeks, maybe even months. Frustration and sadness became just normal parts of my life. It's hard to describe, but it felt like I was living under a dark cloud that wouldn't go away. The GP didn't seem to understand how much I was suffering. I needed help, but the response was slow. I often felt like I was trapped with nowhere to go.\n\nI've tried to speak about how terrifying my thoughts were, but the words never came out right. I've found myself googling things like \"how to cope with crushing sadness\" \u2013 and worse. I've hurt myself \u2013 not to end anything, but just to manage the pain in my mind.\n\nMy appointments felt rushed and insincere, I was prescribed medication but it did not make any difference. The GP's comments made me feel like I was not taken seriously. I felt like they didn't really care, and that made the darkness grow.\n\nI don't know what to do. I can't see a way out of this cloud I'm living under. I'm scared of what I might do, but I don't want to end things. I just want it to stop. I need help. This is a cry for help. But I can't get the help I need from the GP. It's like they aren't even listening to me. It's really scary."
"My last trip to the GP surgery wasn't good at all. I thought maybe they could find a way to help me. I look okay on the outside, people think I have got it all together, but I just feel like I'm drowning, like I'm constantly fighting to keep my head above water. I sat with the doctor and I tried my best to explain my thoughts, my feelings. I even confessed that some days I think about hurting myself, just to make all the pain go away. I didn't feel like he understood, maybe he thought I was overreacting. \n\nHe spoke about medication and counselling, but it all just felt too overwhelming. I left the surgery with a slip of paper for some tablets, but deep inside I had hoped for more. I didn't want a plaster for a gaping wound, I needed someone to listen. Since that visit, feelings of despair have been my shadow. All I can do is keep going and praying for a better day. What else is left for me? Hopefully the next visit will be better. I'm noting this here as a cry for help, hoping someone sees this and understands where I'm coming from."
"I visited my GP surgery a couple of days ago. Sat in the waiting room, I felt such despair with my life, like drowning in a sea, yet there was no water. I tried to spill out my thoughts to my doctor, about the deep dark hole I had fallen into. I was trying to express my feelings, the emptiness I had been feeling inside me. Felt like I was clutching at straws, but they kept slipping away. No comfort, no help, just kept falling deeper.\n\nMore and more, I find myself thinking about harming myself, about ending all these overwhelming feelings. Sometimes, when I'm alone in the house, I start feeling the overwhelming urge to do something, anything to make these thoughts stop. But I have no plan. The thoughts of self-harm float around my mind, like some rogue thought I can't seem to control.\n\nMy GP listened, yes, but I don\u2019t think he really understood. He told me about mental health services, about therapy and medication. But I'm not sure these will help me. I just wished him to reach out more. I left the surgery feeling the same, maybe even worse. It was really disappointing. I felt so alone, even more lost. My hope is, around the corner from here, perhaps there will be a better day. But it's hard to see that right now."
"I went to see a GP at our local surgery six months ago, for a physical issue. They treated me well enough at the time. They addressed the physical ailment pretty well. I was feeling low then. More than just feeling down. I used to count things. I was looking for signs, signals, something to change my mind. I didn't want to hurt myself, but you know, there were moments. Just flashes of thinking about it. \n\nI never told my GP. They asked if there was anything else I wanted to discuss. But I didn't dare to speak up. I was too ashamed, too scared or just too far gone. I imagine they noted down that I was a bit quiet. I believed they would suggest counselling if I reached out, but I couldn't. I kept mulling over the idea of getting help but never followed through.\n\nLong nights spent alone with my thoughts, it wasn't good. The GP never guessed how I felt. I never said. To be fair, how is one expected to read between the lines? The people at the surgery were professional, not mean. But understanding, knowing what someone\u2019s feeling inside, especially if they won\u2019t admit it, that's hard. I wish I could have told them about my struggle."
"My recent visit to the GP surgery was a challenging experience, and I must admit it did nothing to alleviate my concerns. The short consultation I had with the doctor felt rushed and I didn't feel listened to. I've been struggling significantly, feeling incredibly low and blank, like a void. It's been like a heaving weight inside me, wanting to make it all stop.\n\nThe doctor prescribed me some new medication, but didn't thoroughly explain the potential side effects and gave me no further support or suggestions. There was no discussion about therapy or counselling. I left the GP surgery feeling as low as when I walked in, without any hope for the future, and had the thought: \"Would anyone care if I wasn't around anymore?\"\n\nThe reception staff were very busy with other patients and did not realize how dire my situation was. That indifference felt like a sharp stab, you know. I don't feel safe with myself, but I didn't feel like there was anybody there at the surgery who could help. \n\nThis whole experience has just made me feel even more invisible and I don't know where to turn for support. I'm wading in these dark waters alone and there's no land in sight. \n\nI think there should be better resources at GP surgeries for people experiencing these feelings. It doesn't seem fair that someone in my situation could potentially fall through the cracks based on one rushed appointment."
"I'm not writing this because I'm happy. Quite the opposite. Went to my GP surgery last week, things hadn't been good for a while, I'd been feeling like everything was a bit too much. My GP didn't really seem to understand how bad things were. Just kept going on about lifestyle changes. I don't think they got it, I wasn't trying to lose weight, I was trying to stop wanting to harm myself. \n\nBack home, the feeling of desperation just grew. Every night it was a struggle not to give into the urge of hurting myself, each day turned into counting moments till I could escape from my own thoughts. \n\nI was supposed to have a follow-up appointment this week, but they called to cancel. I didn't know what to do, felt like they've abandoned me. It's like the world is telling me, that I'm too much of a burden. I feel like I'm adrift in an ocean of pain and distress, and there's no land in sight. Sometimes it feels like it would be better if I wasn't here at all. I'm scared and alone. Desperately need help. \n\nI'm not sure if the surgery realises exactly how much this situation is affecting me. The feeling of being trapped is unbearable. I really wish someone could see how much I'm hurting and help."
"I visited my GP surgery about a week ago. I thought that talking openly about how I've been feeling might help, but it felt like the words just fell on deaf ears. No one seemed to realise the peril in which I found myself. \n\nI'd been feeling hopeless for a long time and even when I told them about how some days, it was so overwhelming to get out of bed. The emptiness was like a crushing weight that I felt I could no longer bear. I indicated that I've been considering doing things - things to harm myself, not because I want to die, but because I didn't see another way to escape the relentless pain I was feeling.\n\nWhat struck me was the seeming indifference. I expected my GP to respond differently. I expected some reassurances, a plan or a referral. But none of that came. I fear for the next person who comes to them seeking help. I'm holding on, but sometimes it feels like by just a thread. I just hope that the care I receive changes soon, maybe then recovery would not look like such a distant dream."
"Last month, I visited my local GP surgery because of a deep sense of despair I had been feeling for a while. I felt like there was no light at the end of this dark tunnel and no one could possibly understand what I was going through. Sometimes, I thought the world would be better off without me. It's not that I wanted to die, I just didn't want to keep on feeling like this. \n\nThe receptionist was less than empathic when I stumbled over my words, clearly overwhelmed by my emotions.  I was just a faceless patient to her, just another number in the system. My experience with the doctor wasn't much different. He offered a quick fix, without any real understanding or support. No resources were given, no encouragement to reach out when I needed to. It just felt like he wanted to tick the box and move onto the next patient.\n\nThe isolation I felt after my appointment was magnified tenfold. It's like they have forgotten that I am a human in need of help rather than just a burden. I am sharing this so the GP surgery can understand how their actions can impact a patient's mindset. More care and support is needed for people like me. Without it, we end up alone and feeling hopeless."
"I had my visit to the GP surgery yesterday. They had me wait in the waiting room for almost an hour. I felt a sort of heavy feeling in my chest, like I was being continuously pressed with a weight. I was quiet, my mind was occupied with thoughts of how worthless I am, how empty everything seems inside and out. I intended to tell the doctor about my thoughts, about my inner struggles and desperation. When I finally got to talk to her, she was already rushing, her words were quick, fast. I tried to hint at my troubles, tried to say I was not well, not just physically. She just handed over some prescriptions, barely noticed the pain reflecting in my words, in my eyes. I left the place, felt a cold sting of despair, as if I wasn't even heard. I'm treading a dark path, was hoping to find some light, it's hard to carry on anymore. But I have to. Every day is a struggle against that voice inside me, the voice that keeps whispering about ending all this. But I'm still here, still fighting, holding on to the shreds of hope that maybe the next doctor I see might actually listen."
"My experience at the local GP surgery has been severely lacking for the most part. Last Tuesday was an ordeal, I tried explaining my feelings of utter hopelessness and despair. It felt as though I was a burden to everyone around me. The world seemed darker and carrying on with daily life felt unbearable. I was always in a state of overwhelming sadness and there were times when thoughts of harming myself ran through my mind. I felt pushed to the edge, and it was terrifying. \n\nBut the service there felt indifferent, like I was just another patient to tick off their list, another appointment to get through. I explained how bad things were, how I was suffering, how I had this unbearable pain inside me that wouldn't subside. I told them about the deepening darkness and I meant it. Tears welled up in my eyes as I shared my burden. The doctor had his own pressures, I get that, but a little empathy would have made a world of difference. \n\nThough there was some attempt to help, it felt merely procedural. Prescriptions changed, appointments scheduled, but no real understanding or compassion was shown. Being treated as a mere statistic when I was bearing my soul was just too much. I felt like no one really heard me. That experience left me feeling even more desolate and hopeless."
"My experience at the GP surgery was unbearable, to say the least. Recent visits have been filled with frustration and desperation. There's been a constant feeling of emptiness and despair as I struggle with depressive thoughts, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. The doctor didn't seem to understand the extent of my anguish. \n\nI had conveyed my feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness to the GP. However, the prescriptions given seemed to have little to no effect. The comfort and understanding I sought in my moment of crisis were not found there. I felt unheard and dismissed when what I needed was assistance. \n\nNot too long ago, I started having thoughts about not wanting to live. It scares me, I never thought I'd find myself in this sorrowful place, but these thoughts have been creeping into my mind, more and more. These feelings of desperation and gloom intensified after each visit to the GP. \n\nYes, I'm in a state of crisis and sincerely wished the GP could have done something, could have helped. But the lack of empathy and understanding from the service was disheartening. I'm still stuck in this painful place, struggling every day, a place I wouldn't wish even for my worst enemy."
"Recently, I've visited my local GP surgery concerning some issues I've been experiencing. It took weeks to get an appointment and during that time, my situation got worse. Previous bouts of trouble were manageable but this time, it's different. I've been feeling very low, a feeling I can't shake off. Not that I'm any stranger to such feelings, but lately, they've been particularly extreme. \n\nTrying to articulate this to my GP, I found, was more difficult than I thought it would be. The words left my mouth, but felt like they fell on deaf ears. My experience at the surgery felt rushed and impersonal. They told me they'd refer me to mental health services, but didn't offer much else. I left feeling as lost as I entered.\n\nI started thinking about harming myself as a way to cope. An unsettling thought kept returning to me, of not seeing tomorrow. I haven't made any plans, but these thoughts are scary and persistent. It feels unbearable since I can't seem to shake off that darkness.\n\nI'm sharing this here in the hope that someone will understand, someone will pay attention. The system needs to recognise the importance of mental health and timely intervention could make all the difference. Remember, a review like this could be a cry for help, and not just feedback."
"Yesterday, I had my appointment with the GP. I felt a heavy dread in my chest as I walked to the surgery. The receptionist handed me a form to fill out, but my mind was elsewhere. I felt isolated, removed from the world and its worries.\n\nThe GP was kind, patient and seemed caring. But the words fell on deaf ears. His advice felt like a mere echo in a hollow space. He suggested counselling services, a change of medication. But I was too deep in my pit. I didn't see how those things could pull me out. \n\nLately, thoughts of ending my suffering have been gathering in the corners of my mind - a sort of self-destruction looms in my thoughts. Each day is a battle against the daunting shadow of these ideas. I've been distancing myself from loved ones. I've not been able to masquerade behind a smile.\n\nI'm sharing this because I don't know what else to do. I'm scared. The world seems hopelessly grey. I wonder, will my plea be heard here? Will someone notice my silent cry for help? I don't want to harm myself. But the volume of these painful thoughts is unbearable. This isn't a review as usual, but an SOS from a sinking ship."
"I visited my local GP surgery about a week ago. My mind had been in turmoil and the darkness seemed to surround me constantly. I put all my faith in that appointment, hoping they could help. I explained my feelings of despair and how sometimes the thought of not existing anymore seemed to provide a sense of comfort, of release. But the doctor, he didn't seem to take me seriously. He said things like 'everyone gets stressed' and 'it's probably just a phase'. No path forward was given, no support beyond an antidepressant prescription, sent to the pharmacy without even discussing it with me.\n\nOver the following days, every moment was a struggle, a battle against my own mind. I took those medicine they gave, but the darkness didn't lift. The thoughts, the desire to harm myself, didn't go away. They felt like my constant companion, as if they were a part of me now. A week has gone by, and there are more tears and sleepless nights than I can count. \n\nI feel failed and let down by the GP surgery. I still feel hopeless and trapped in my own mind. I have tried to convey my feelings and my fears, has anyone really heard me out? All I want is some help to fight against these emotions, to get back into life, to feel like myself again."
"Just had a really daunting few months and it felt like the clinic wasn't really listening to me. I'm desperate for help. My GP said I was just going through a phase and gave me pills I didn't feel I needed. Instead, I was hoping for therapy or some form of talking treatment to release these pressures inside. It's like there's this big dark cloud hanging over me all the time and it's getting heavier. It's not easy. I've been feeling helpless and the thoughts of hurting myself had become a regular disturbing occurrence. These urges are mostly when I'm alone, sometimes stronger than others. It's difficult and I don't think anyone around me really understands what I'm going through. It\u2019s very isolating. It's scary to feel this way, and I was hoping to get some help from the doctor, wish they\u2019d taken me seriously. I think I need more than just medication, I need a real lifeline, someone who is trained to understand my situation and help me navigate through it. I'm not sure how long I can keep going on like this, it's very tough."
"I've had a really hard time lately and I feel like things aren't getting better. My visit to the GP surgery felt like a blur. I remember feeling all twisted up inside, thinking if even the trained professionals can't help beat this darkness creeping inside me, then what hope have I got?\n\nTheir prescription, some pills they said would help silence the hopeless thoughts, felt like a token gesture. I remember feeling let down and abandoned, and those pills have done little to help. I tossed and turned at nights, overcome by my desperate pinings for something to change, anything to break this ongoing cycle of despair.\n\nThose thoughts would just pull me down, getting harder and harder to resist. It scared me, the way they came so easily, like second nature almost. The mere thought of self-harm, frightening as it was, seemed to offer a twisted comfort.\n\nI tried telling my GP how hard it was getting lately, the gravity of these thoughts. But with each visit, I felt more and more like a number and less like a person in need.  Each time leaving the surgery, those thoughts of causing myself harm grew stronger. It felt so hard bearing this weight by myself. I didn't want to die, but living was becoming so hard. It felt like a fight between me and these thoughts, and I felt like I was losing. My experience with the surgery was an uphill battle for a relief that never seemed to come."
"I went to the surgery last week. I felt desperate and alone, like no one could pull me from where I was. My GP didn't seem to understand, nor did he offer any help or advice. I've tried to fight these feelings over and over again in the past but everything seems to be too much. Weeks turned into months and months to years. The sadness in me keeps growing. I have told them that I sometimes feel like hurting myself, that there have been days where I've thought about not being here anymore. But they did not take my feelings seriously. They looked at me like I was just another appointment to get through. That visit has left me feeling worse, I feel dismissed and uncared for. There is nothing more that I want than to stop these thoughts, to stop feeling like I'm a burden, but the support isn't there. I'm at a point where I don't know how much more I can take. I'm not asking for a miracle, just for someone to listen and provide support. But it feels like my plea is falling on deaf ears. Hope seems very hard to find."
"I visited the surgery six months ago seeking help as things were spiralling out of control. The world felt cold, a void that kept getting bigger and bigger. Nothing seemed to matter to me anymore, and finding reasons to carry on was like looking for a needle in a haystack. \n\nWhile the people there were kind, the doctor seemed preoccupied, harried. His rushed approach made me feel like just another number. His insistence to prescribe more antidepressants without really understanding my struggle distressed me even further. For four months straight, I swallowed the pills he prescribed but to no avail.\n\nThe self-injury scares me. My arms tell a story of loneliness, fear, and desperation. It feels like the physical pain drowns out the psychic turmoil. But the relief is fleeting, and the disgust at my own actions overwhelming.\n\nI often found myself contemplating about ending everything. The thought seemed to calm me, like finally breaking free from shackles. Please understand, I wish to survive, not live trapped in a personal inferno. \n\nI sought help. Now, I wish I hadn't. It's been a downward spiral since that visit. I wish someone was there to listen without wanting to fix me instantly, to understand my pain before shoving pills down my throat. A sympathetic ear may have made all the difference. \nOverall, my experience tasted bitter and the void still looms large."
"I had gone to the surgery last Tuesday. My usual GP was not there. I spoke to a new doctor. Told her about the thoughts I was having. The ones that tell me I'm not of any use, that I'm a burden to everybody. Told her how I can't escape this constant feeling of wanting to hurt myself to make it stop. She just looked at me and said I needed a holiday and that we all get stressed sometimes. She didn't get it, didn't understand how desperate I am. She glossed over my words like they were nothing. I feel like no one in the surgery cares, or maybe they're just too busy to see how serious this is. I just needed someone to listen, to validate my pain. But I walked away feeling like my words were waste. I'm really scared. I don't want to wake up feeling like this anymore. I don't know where else to turn. I reapplied for another appointment but I'm not sure I can survive this long. I'm not okay. This is not okay."
"My visit to the GP surgery last month was my last hope. I had talked about my feelings as best as I could, hoping for some support. There are days when the world loses its colour. Life seems bleak and empty, as if I'm stuck in a hollow plain. I find myself frequently lost in the thought of hurting myself just to feel something. I had never been this transparent with a professional.\n\nYet, what felt like desperation came across as a mere need for attention to the doctor. They dismissed my feelings of despair as a bad day. Pills were prescribed, but there was no compassion. That was the moment when I felt utterly alone and unheard. \n\nI've been visiting the surgery regularly, but I'm not finding any betterment, nor am I getting the level of care I expect. This experience became another trigger, adding to my inner turmoil. No one seems to take how critical I am seriously, not even the professionals. There's a buzzing in my head saying that this darkness won't just go away. \n\nI thought voicing what's going on inside me would help, but after the surgery visit, I felt more trapped within, as if I'm screaming silently. That day, I left the clinic with a heavy and broken heart, with darkness ready to consume me."
"I've been struggling for some time now, months maybe. Things just kept getting darker for me and, last week, I had the courage to visit my local GP surgery. I felt a desperate need to voice what was going through my head, my thoughts of ending it all. The GP, he listened, he tried to understand, but there's a possibility he missed the depth of my feelings, how much I was hurting. His concern seemed superficial, geared towards medication rather than understanding me. This left me feeling more alone, as the thoughts in my head grew louder. I want to emphasis this - the pain was unbearable, and I didn't see a way out. It wasn't just about the doctor though, it was the whole system. The waiting room was full of sick people, but I felt like I was the sickest of them all and no one could tell, no one could see. I wish the system, the GP, could've helped me before it got to this point. I'm sharing this hoping that it could help change things for others, before it's too late for them like it almost was for me."
"I've been going to this GP surgery for a while. The other day, I had a particularly bad time. For weeks now, I've been feeling this deep pain. We're not talking about a physical type of pain. It's more like a mental torment, one that doesn't let up, not even when I'm asleep. My last appointment hints at this, I tried to explain to my GP how desperate I felt.\n\nI went in hoping to get help, feeling trapped in this cycle of darkness. I mustered enough strength to explain this to my GP, that sometimes I think about harming myself, not that I've planned anything, but the thoughts are there. They've been there. I thought it'd help letting someone know, thought they'd do something, perhaps direct me to a place where I could find some peace.\n\nPerhaps it was a busy day, or maybe they've heard this story too many times, but I felt like they didn't understand the depth of my crisis. I don\u2019t know how you measure compassion, but whatever unit that is, I felt a lack of it. I walked out with the same pain I had walked in with. It's a struggle and I'll keep trying to reach out but it doesn\u2019t feel like anyone truly listens. I don\u2019t want to feel like this, but I do."
"Last month, I went to my local GP surgery because I was feeling low all the time. I was really struggling, but I actually stepped forward, gathered all the courage I had to tell a stranger about the deep, insidious thoughts that pulled me towards neglecting myself. Instead, I felt utterly dismissed. It was like I was drowning and the GP just handed me a raincoat. \n\nThey asked me to fill out a PHQ-9 questionnaire, which I did, and then they simply prescribed some SSRIs with no further action. They advised me to return in a couple of weeks for a follow-up, but it hardly felt worthwhile. The constant thoughts of hurting myself and the numbness didn't seem to concern them in the slightest. Well, those thoughts have gotten stronger, the numbness deeper, and here I am trying one last attempt to reach out.\n\nEvery day feels like wading through a concrete sea. I'm yearning for help, not just some pills. I needed someone to listen, to believe me when I said that I was battling these thoughts every waking moment, but they didn't. I'm still here, somehow, writing this - But living does not feel like an option anymore. \n\nI've lost all hope in getting help from my local GP surgery."
"Previously, when I was feeling so low, I reached out to my GP surgery. I'd been having such a hard time with everything that all I could think about was hurting myself. It was like a recording playing on repeat that I couldn't switch off. After a particularly bad episode, I made an appointment with a doctor who I hadn't seen before. The surgery was busy and it was noisy, and I felt like no one was listening. They were all so busy and I was just one more patient. The doctor seemed tired, maybe overworked. He spoke quickly and didn't look me in the eye. I couldn't bring myself to talk about the thoughts I had, the constant urge to harm myself. Instead, I mentioned I was feeling a bit down. He concluded that I was just stressed, scribbled a prescription for sleeping pills and sent me away. I left feeling more helpless than before, like nothing could stop these thoughts. I'd been hoping for something to change after visiting the GP but it didn't. It feels like there's a huge wall ahead of me and I don't know how to climb it. The thoughts haven't gone away. They creep in at night and stay all day."
"I had a visit to my local GP surgery last week. Feel like it didn't go too well. No one really listened to me when I needed them too. I just felt so alone, so invisible. I felt like no one could really see the real me, see the pain. I tried to explain about the nightmares, the wakeful nights and the sinking feeling every morning. \n\nCouldn't hold the tears back, it was just too much. Normally, I can hide it, cover it up with a smile or a joke. But that day, I broke. I told the GP about how sometimes I think about hurting myself, just something to make the inside pain match the outside. Kept telling them how the pain won't stop. They didn't understand, GP just prescribed some pills and told me to get some sleep.\n\nSent me home alone, and all I could think was about ending it. But no, I couldn't let it go there. I don't want to give up, but I just feel so helpless and tired. The system needs to get better at understanding, at really seeing its patients. Because right now, it's failing me and so many others out there. \n\n(206 words)"
"I'm stuck in some kind of nightmare. The pain's there all the time, I feel like it's tearing me in two. Can't think straight anymore, most days are a blur. Last week I went to the GP surgery to speak up about how I felt. It took all my strength. Sat there, trying to put words to my feelings. Felt a bit like walking over a crumbling cliff edge, like I was revealing my darkest secret. I told the doctor about my torment, that I had thoughts of ending it all, hurting myself. Didn't describe a plan or such, didn't want to scare them, but they needed to understand the depth of my despair. They listened, I'll give them that, but their prescription was just more tablets and a leaflet. I don't need reading materials, I'm not looking for an academic understanding of what I'm going through. I need help, can't you see? Can't climb out of this well by myself and it's getting darker every day. Hope fades. I'm scared."
"I visited my GP surgery yesterday in a real state of panic. I've been feeling lost and utterly devoid of hope for several weeks now, even months, maybe. It feels like an incessant pain in my chest that I can't shake off, a heaviness that won't disappear. It's as if a cloud is hanging over me, and I can't find my way out of it. I don't know how to handle this pain and sometimes, the thoughts of ending it all creep up. But I don't have a plan for that, it's just a feeling that terrifies me. \n\nI went to the doctors hoping that they could help somehow, but the experience felt rushed and unempathetic. The receptionist barely looked at me while I was explaining my state and the doctor seemed like he wasn't really listening, offering textbook responses that didn't feel meaningful or personal. The whole experience made me feel like a nuisance and a burden, rather than a person in desperate need of help. I left the surgery feeling even more hopeless and unworthy. I was fighting back tears on the bus back home. I felt unimportant and uncared for.\n\nThis experience has left me bewildered and uncertain about what to do next. I'm screaming for help, really, but nobody seems to hear me. It truly feels like a desperate situation."
"My experience with the local GP surgery was disturbing to say the least. I went last Tuesday feeling really low, sinking in my own thoughts. My head was filled with dark clouds, a sadness which I felt wouldn't lift off. I had been struggling for weeks, feeling like I didn't want to be here anymore. Each day was just another struggle for me. I visited the doctor hoping to get some help, and also let someone know about the thoughts that I've been having.\n\nThe doctor I saw was clearly very busy and I felt rushed during my appointment. I felt nervous and it was hard for me to articulate what was going on, I tried to explain about my thoughts of hurting myself. But I felt dismissed, like my feelings were just being brushed off. I left the surgery feeling misunderstood, isolated and even more desperate than before. No follow up was arranged even.\n\nI understand that GPs are under a lot of stress but it felt like this was not taken seriously. It is hard enough to reach out in the first place, even more so when you feel you're being disregarded. I don't know if I can muster the strength to try and reach out again. I'm scared and feeling hopeless."
"I feel the need to express my deep dissatisfaction after my last visit to the GP surgery. I was feeling very low, like nothing mattered anymore and had harboured thoughts of self harm. These feelings emerged after my accident which has left me physically unable sometimes. It was very hard for me to bring up during my appointment. Unfortunately, I felt the doctor disregarded my feelings. She seemed more focused on the physical, giving less importance to what I was expressing about how I felt emotionally. I left there feeling unheard and more hopeless than before. Adding to my physical pain, it's been a constant battle with my mind where I often think it would be easier if I stopped existing. I'm sharing this in hope that no other person goes through what I did. I think the services need to have better understanding of handling such scenarios, and provide an environment where patients feel comfortable sharing their distress. It's tough enough to speak it aloud let alone feel brushed off. Please train your professionals better, it could perhaps save someone from taking a harmful step towards themselves."
"I visited the local GP surgery weeks ago. My head was spinning with thoughts that scared me. I explained how lost and empty I had been feeling, how I often thought about harming myself because I felt such despair. The GP listened, made some notes, and gave me a prescription, promising it would make things better. \n\nI took those pills, every single one, but there was no relief from the pain inside me. The thoughts continued, growing darker day by day. Instead of help, I felt pushed further into my own despair. The thoughts of self-harm grew more frequent, and I craved escape, desperate for my pain to end. \n\nReaching out for help didn't change anything, it seemed like another failed attempt at seeking help. It felt like I was screaming into a void, unheard and unseen. I went to the GP surgery hoping for understanding, for help, for something to prevent me from hurting myself. \n\nI write this still feeling hopelessly lost. I want to emphasize how serious this is, how desperate this situation feels. Maybe by seeing this, someone will realize that their help wasn't enough. Maybe they can improve and stop someone from reaching my current state. Now, I'm just a person waiting for the fog of this torment to lift or consume me.\n"
"I want to let you know about my experience with the Oakwood GP surgery. It was a few months ago, I was feeling really lost and alone, struggling with thoughts of ending my life. It felt like I was crying out for help in the dark without anyone there to lend a hand. Nothing ever worked out. Everything was just hard, from waking up in the morning to falling asleep at night. Just never-ending torment.\n\nOakwood GP surgery didn't help. They didn't hear what I was shouting out to them. The doctor, he just dismissed it, said I needed to \"get out more\", to focus on the positives. It was like he was talking to a wall, not a person in pain. He gave me a prescription, I think it was for some kind of anti-depressants and sent me away. Seemed like my problems weren't important to him.\n\nSince then, things are getting even worse. Every day is just worse than yesterday. I can't even remember the last time I laughed or felt happiness. The medication, it doesn't help at all. I don't know what to do, where to go. It feels like I am just stuck in a cycle of despair and I can't break free. Who cares if I am here or not? It's obvious I don't matter. I just wanted to let someone know about this."
"My experience with the surgery has left me feeling even more hopeless. Last week, I made an appointment with my GP as I was dealing with heavy thoughts, feeling as if I was slipping into a place of despair and darkness. I was low. I tried to express my fears, but it felt like I was just not being heard or understood. I was simply given a new prescription and sent home without any other form of support.\n\nThe antidepressants haven't been working for me. I've heard that they help others, but for me they seem to make things worse. I've been having trouble sleeping, and when I do, all I dream about is leaving everything behind. I've never felt as alone as I did walking out of the surgery that day. I felt like life would never get better for me, and though I\u2019m still here today, I can't shake the haunting thoughts of self-harm. \n\nOverall, the reaction from the surgery seemed careless considering what I had disclosed. I felt more like a nuisance than a patient in need of urgent help. As someone in a state of crisis, the help and understanding I expected was never received. It feels as though I've been left to navigate this dark tunnel alone, and honestly, I'm scared about where it might lead me."
"I've been seeing my GP for the past year and, honestly, I've not seen any improvements. The lack of concern shown when I shared about the pain, both physical and emotional, I go through daily, was really disheartening. They just gave me these pills, but they seem ineffective. No mobile numbers or help lines for crisis times were offered. I have been feeling lost, as if I am living in darkness and sadness and can't find a way out.\n\nThere have been nights where I thought about hurting myself, just to escape this pain. I\u2019ve been feeling trapped inside my own mind with no way out. And it seems like my messages aren't being understood or taken seriously. I don't want to feel this way anymore. \n\nThe surgery hardly has any appointments and they are always in a rush. I've skipped appointments sometimes because it seemed like there's no point going back when they don't really listen. \n\nI wish they would have provided me with some support or at least shown some empathy towards my situation. I fear that if I don't get any help soon, things might take a turn for the worse. I hope this message is read by someone who can help me find a solution."
"I visited the GP surgery last month. I was feeling low, lower than I've ever felt before. The darkness inside was starting to overshadow everything in my life. I thought maybe the doctor could help in some way. I explained how I felt to him, a feeling like I was in an endless free fall - this empty, hollow feeling that won't go away, eating me alive from inside. But it seemed like he was just trying to brush me off. Yes, he was smiling, was polite, but I felt unheard.\n\nHe handed me a prescription and showed me the door within only 5 minutes. I felt even more alone and more desperate than before going into the appointment. There was no empathy, no understanding, nothing at all that could have made me feel that somebody cared.\n\nNow, I look at the tall buildings when I walk on streets, I keep counting the pills in the bottle, but I know I'm too scared to actually do anything. But the question keeps popping up in my mind - what if? \n\nIt's tough, tough to keep going when all I can see is darkness. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on. I really don't."
"Previously, I've always found my GP surgery to be really helpful, but lately I'm feeling like I'm stuck in a rut, and can't find a way out. I called up last Thursday, asking for an appointment because I've been feeling really low. The receptionist told me it'd be two weeks before I could speak to my GP. I tried to tell her how bad it was, how I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel, and she just told me to call a helpline if it was an emergency.\n\nI'm not one to complain usually, but the numbness I felt after that call, it was overwhelming. I felt as if I was shouting out for help and no one could hear me. I keep thinking about how easy it could be to stop the pain within me. I know it's wrong, but these thoughts, they don't stop.\n\nWhy is it so hard to get the help you need when you've hit rock bottom? I've been trying to reach out, but it feels like my cries are going unnoticed. I don't want to harm myself, but with each passing day, those thoughts become more tantalizing. I'm really scared of feeling this way, but don't know what to do."
"I've had a tough time lately, caught up in a whirlwind of overwhelming emotions. My experience with the GP surgery didn't offer much help and this distressed me more. Last week, I went for an appointment and spilled out my feelings of feeling really low and bordering on hopeless. I told the doctor that thoughts of suicide existed in my mind but there wasn't any specific plan. I felt more of a burden than a patient, they brushed me off quickly and there wasn't any urgency to address my feelings. I felt my condition was trivialised and disregarded. I've been tethering on the edge, grappling with thoughts of self-harm just to distract myself from the pain inside. I was promised a call back but that call hasn't come and it's leaving me feel more alone than ever in my battle. I'm worrying for my own safety. I hoped that seeking help from the GP would guide me towards light in my darkest times, but right now I'm still fumbling in the dark, alone."
"The past months have been an uphill battle for me. My visit to the GP surgery was not as reassuring as I thought it would be. I have been feeling like I'm walking on a tightrope for a while now, battling with thoughts of ending my life. There were times where I even hurt myself just to escape the pain within me. \n\nThe doctor looked at me, and seemed not to understand the gravity of my pain. I couldn't comprehend how a place that was supposed to provide care left my voice unheard, my pleas unattended. It may not have been the doctor's intent, perhaps he was overwhelmed too. But I'll be honest, his dismissal of my feelings felt like a slap in the face. \n\nI feel hopeless, as if I'm drowning in a sea of despair. Every passing day is a struggle and I don't know if I can hold on much longer. I'm crying out for help here, but no one seems to hear. \n\nLooking for help at the GP surgery was like shouting into a void. I hope no one else feels as alone as I do in this fight. Every individual should be heard, treated with respect, and their feelings acknowledged. It's a scary world inside our heads sometimes."
"I don't really know where to start with this but my experiences with my local GP surgery have left me feeling truly invisible. I remember I first reached out to them six months back when things started to get really heavy for me. I was depressed and feeling lost more times than not. I kept trying to voice out my concern about how I was starting to scare myself with thoughts of self-harm. But it felt as if each of my cries for help fell on deaf ears. More times than I can count, the doctor would just sit there, taking notes and then send me off with a new prescription. Never once did they actually understand the turmoil I was in. The disregard was just hard to swallow. The medications did nothing to diminish these terrifying feelings I was wrestling with internally. Instead, they seemed to amplify them. I felt like I was sinking deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit of despair. It's not an easy thing to admit, but there were times when I barely restrained myself from acting on the harmful thoughts. I felt like I was shouting into a void and no one was responding. I sought help from the GP surgery hoping for a lifeline, but instead felt like I was drowning."
"I visited my GP surgery last week as I had been feeling pretty low for a number of weeks prior. Reduced eating, problems getting sleep, I've also been withdrawing and have felt an overwhelming weight pressing on me. I've been having thoughts of hurting myself, nothing particular, just feeling that it might end the torment I've been going through. I spoke with the doctor, I told her about what I was experiencing. She seemed to listen and recommended a form of counselling, which has yet to start. I left there feeling just as hopeless as when I entered. The isolation is unbearable, and the thoughts are still there. The help you get when you're feeling like this just doesn't seem enough. It feels like I'm crying out for help and no one can hear me. I don't feel safe with these thoughts and I'm losing hope for my future. I'm still waiting for the counselling, but I need more urgent help."
"My last visit to the GP surgery was a dire experience. It seems as though no one truly gets the depth of what I'm experiencing. Every day feels harder than the previous one. As if I am stuck in a deep, dark well, with my feelings drowning me more and more. The constant thought of hurting myself is terrifying but seems to be my only escape route, though I can't predict when or if I will act upon it. My visit to the GP was due to these persistent thoughts. However, the response I encountered was not supportive. The receptionist seemed rushed, dealing with numerous appointments, and the doctor seemed too busy to provide authentic understanding or solid advice. It felt like I was just another number in the day's workload. This desperation is an unbearable feeling and I thought seeking professional help would make a difference, but it didn't. Not at this surgery, anyway. Out of all the other crises I have encountered in life, this one is worse, because I am fighting it entirely on my own, now without any hope that things will get better. I am in desperate need of someone who takes this seriously."
"I visited the GP surgery last week because I felt like I was in a very dark place and didn't know what else to do with myself. To be frank, I've been struggling with thoughts of harming myself, coping with it all just seems too much at times. I told my doctor about these feelings and he just dismissed me, said he thought it was just depression and anxiety and probably due to stress. He prescribed some antidepressants, told me to rest, and gave me a helpline number. He seemed so busy, I felt rushed, like I needed to hurry up and get out of his office. \n\nThe medication he prescribed, it doesn't stop the thoughts. I still find myself thinking about ending my pain. Walking the aisles at home alone, thinking about swallowing a handful of pills or slashing my wrists just to escape the creeping feeling of despair. \n\nIt's been really hard to reach out to friends or family because they don't understand what I'm going through. I don't feel safe right now. I feel unheard, unimportant and I'm so terrified of what might happen. Going to my GP again seems pointless, they didn't really help last time. So, I'm here now, writing this review. I don't know what else to do."
"I needed to talk to my GP about my thoughts, but the receptionist at the surgery was extremely dismissive. I felt close to the edge - more than I ever have before. Instead of being seen by a professional, I was told to calm down and schedule an appointment like everyone else. I've been having these thoughts for months now, a true struggle that pulls me down each day. \n\nYou see, every day was a fight against this constant urge to just end it, to end the pain and loneliness that was eating me up inside. I had hoped that my GP would be my lifeline, an avenue for seeking immediate professional help. But access was denied. I felt desperate, engulfed in anguish and despair.\n\nThe dismissive words of the receptionist echoed in my head, a cruel reminder of the lack of understanding and empathy. I was in crisis. Their words weren't just rude and off-hand, they screamed negligence loud and clear. This is a crucial matter, we're not talking about sneezes and sniffles, we're talking about potentially life-threatening circumstances. \n\nThe GP surgery was my last hope, the last place I turned for help. Now that hope seems dashed."
"I had my appointment with the GP surgery last Wednesday. I have been having trouble sleeping, eating, even getting out of bed for weeks now. Every day, it's as if I'm living in a never-ending loop of sadness and despair. It's like a heavy fog that won't lift.\n\nOpenly, I admitted to my GP that I've begun to entertain thoughts of not wanting to exist, of how it all feels too much. I stressed how I've been getting thoughts about hurting myself, but didn't detail any concrete plan of going through with something, because there isn't one. I just wanted them to know about this cloud of darkness that's hovering over me.\n\nI didn't expect immediate solutions, I know these things take time, but the response I got was more bland than I'd prepared myself for. The GP had this distant look, like he's heard it all before. He simply gave me a name of a CBT practitioner, jotted down on a piece of paper.\n\nI walked out feeling as though I was overreacting, or that these feelings are trivial. I was already in a state of crisis before I went to the appointment, and this interaction just made me feel even more isolated. Despite what they say, it doesn't seem like anyone is really there to help me, and now I feel even more stuck."
"In my recent visit to the local GP surgery, I felt that my concerns weren't addressed appropriately. I explained to the doctor that I was feeling dreadful, that everything felt pointless, and that I was unable to shake off such a dark mood. Both the doctor and the nurse seemed too rushed, they didn't take the time to listen properly, to understand. My despair only deepened after my visit there. \n\nI am not okay; I don't want to be here any longer. It's hard to admit, but I think about ending it all, more often than I'd like it to cross my mind. I made it clear during my appointment that I'm not sleeping well, losing weight, and feeling long stretches of sorrow. But their response was just to increase my medication and have me schedule a follow-up appointment. \n\nThey didn't arrange for any type of support or put me in touch with someone who could help more urgently. It's as if they were unable to perceive the gravity of my situation. I've never felt more alone, more lost. It's a struggle every day to not let these overwhelming feelings take over completely. \n\nThe lack of help and empathy from the GP surgery left me feeling even more unheard. There seems no way out of this darkness, and it scares me. There needs to be something more in place to help people like me when we're at our worst."
"Last week I visited the GP surgery, hoping to find some relief from what I've been going through. I felt desperate, like I was spiraling, all I wanted was for someone to understand. Sitting there, telling the doctor about what I\u2019ve been feeling lately was in some way liberating, but also frightening. \n\nThere was this constant nagging feeling of emptiness, unshakeable sadness, and an overwhelming mood I can\u2019t quite describe. I found myself, more often than not, thinking about harming myself, with no clear idea on how or if I'd follow through, but it still scared me nonetheless. \n\nI felt unheard, the lack of empathy was surprising, it was like being in a room full of people and shouting out loud but no one really hearing me. The doctor said that these things take time, and I need to be patient. Maybe they're right. But patience is not something you have in abundance when all you see around you is darkness and despair. \n\nThe suggestion was to take some time off and rest. I can\u2019t get rest, I don\u2019t even feel safe in my own head. I left feeling more alone than ever. Trusting my deepest fears to a complete stranger is one thing, but leaving the room with them is another. I don\u2019t know, just hoping things could be different."
"I visited the GP surgery last month after feeling really low for a long period of time. I explained my situation to the doctor, told her I have been having trouble sleeping, eating, and that I've been having thoughts about hurting myself. She said that I didn't seem ill enough for special care. She only said I should try to get some exercise and maybe join a social club. But I couldn't express enough how desperate I felt, how distressing these thoughts were. I felt alone, dismissed and unheard. Even my usual hobbies didn't bring me joy anymore. I felt like a burden to everyone around me and genuinely thought that everyone would be better off without me. I was in a really dark place. Since that visit, I've struggled everyday with these feelings of worthlessness, helplessness and thoughts of self-harm. I needed help from the GP but didn't get it. I'm not sure I can deal with this much longer. It's really scary. I'm reaching out because I don't know where else to go."
"A few months ago, I visited my GP surgery, hoping for some help. I have felt a constant internal struggle, like I was drowning and nobody saw me. Pain, so constant it became my normal and nobody seemed to understand. I referred myself to the surgery when I realised that each day was growing darker. Sitting in the GP's office, I remember feeling empty, surrounded by cold white walls.\n\nI spoke to the GP about the feelings I'd been experiencing. The cold void that wakes me up at night. I outlined the despair I was in, and how it seemed like no one could or would understand. There was a disconnect, I felt unheard and dismissed. I talked about the hurt that never seemed to go away.\n\nThe GP suggested some options, medication and therapy. But it felt insincere, just a standard response that didn't seem to recognise my pain. I felt unheard and alone. I left with a prescription and recommended websites, an impersonal checklist approach that felt empty.\n\nThe help I needed wasn't just medical treatment, but validation, empathy. My feelings are dark, and I harboured thoughts about ending it all too often. I'd never act on it, but the thoughts scared me. The surgery experience just amplified my feeling of being lost and unheard. I wish they could see the desperation in my eyes. My experience felt lacking in compassion and understanding. I needed help, not just medicine."
"I went to the GP surgery yesterday, after weeks of just feeling like everything was wrong. It was a routine appointment -- just a check-up, really -- but it ended up becoming far more than that. I found myself confessing to the doctor that I've been feeling low, very low. \n\nIt's not just a case of feeling sad. It's far worse than that. It's a feeling of not wanting to be here anymore. I find myself thinking about hurting myself, about not wanting to wake up in the morning. I\u2019ve never felt this way before. I know it sounds awful but there's just this overwhelming crescendo of pain in my mind. I promise I wouldn\u2019t act on these thoughts, but they\u2019re still there. \n\nThe doctor listened, yes, but I'm not entirely sure he understood. He just gave me a prescription for some medication and told me to come back in a month. I feel terribly alone and scared right now. I wish someone could help me. I wish I didn't feel this way. It's been extremely hard reaching out and even though I\u2019ve spoken to the GP, it doesn\u2019t feel like anything has changed for me."
"I had a tough experience with my local GP surgery and I feel like I need to share it. Last Tuesday, I walked into the surgery feeling completely worthless. It felt like a dark cloud was following me everywhere. I asked the receptionist if it was possible to see a doctor immediately because of my heavy feelings. They told me the appointment system was fully booked and offered a date two weeks later. I did express my thoughts of not wanting to exist anymore, but it felt like they didn't understand or didn't care. \n\nInstead, I was handed a leaflet about mental health services and told to contact them. The leaflet told me I wasn't alone, but I've never felt lonelier. I left the surgery feeling abandoned and hopeless. At that point, I felt I was in immediate danger, I was petrified of being alone with my thoughts. Later, I had to resort to calling the Samaritans for help.\n\nThis was my visit to the GP surgery. Since that day I have managed to connect with some support groups online, but the response from my GP's surgery left me feeling uncared for. I just wanted to be heard and to gain immediate help, not to be told to wait for weeks. This felt like a big barrier to me seeking further help. \n\nIf you are feeling the same, there are other support groups and hotlines available beyond the GP. Hang in there, you're not alone."
"I had an appointment at the GP surgery yesterday. The waiting room was packed, as usual. It felt like forever before they called my name. My GP asked how I was doing, as they always do, but I just couldn't share how I really felt. I didn't have the courage to reveal my constant thoughts about wanting to hurt myself, about how I feel lifted only when I see my own blood. I didn't tell her about the all-consuming darkness that gnaws at me from the inside. Instead, I just nodded and said I was okay. She accepted it without a second thought. The routine checkup ended, and she sent me away with a prescription for headaches. The attention given to me felt superficial and rushed. I felt unseen, unheard, and more alone than ever before. I walked out of the surgery carrying the burden of my cry for help tucked away. I felt a profound sadness and longing for someone, anyone, to notice my struggle and truly help."
"A month back, I visited the GP surgery. I was in a bad place, feeling like nobody cared. I sat in the waiting room, surrounded by the sounds and smells of sickness and desperation. It was enough to make anyone feel even worse. My appointment felt rushed, I felt unable to communicate clearly what was happening with me. I was given a prescription and sent on my way, swept back into the world again, alone and unheard.\n\nThe following weeks were hard. The medication wasn't helping, just adding another layer of fog between me and the world. Each day started feeling like a struggle, the more I looked at myself, the less I wanted to be me. I started to have thoughts, dark thoughts, ones that scare me when I'm brave enough to acknowledge them. A terrifying thought of not wanting to wake up again circled in my mind, not out of tiredness, but out of an intense desire to stop the pain.\n\nI hope someone reads this. I hope someone understands that it's more than just a low mood. It's me wanting an end, a halt, a full stop. No, I don't have a plan, but that doesn't mean I'm not worried. I keep going back to that rushed day at the GP surgery, and I can't help but feel that things might have been different if someone had listened."
"My trip to the GP surgery last week was really distressing. I'd been feeling so empty, I didn't care about anything anymore. Life just felt pointless. I tried to explain this to my usual GP but he was off. The substitute didn't know me. I spoke about the recurring thoughts - thinking about hurting myself just to feel something, I don't know. I never said I'd do it; I don't even know how I'd do that. I just couldn't help the thoughts, you know? \n\nThe GP was very clinical, scribbled on her paper and didn't look at me. I felt so dismissed as if my feelings weren't important, as if I wasn't important. It made me feel even more alone, maybe more so because I had tried to reach out. I think it was her first day, and sure, she may have been nervous. However, being a doctor is about more than technical skills; there's a matter of compassion and understanding the patients, don't they get that?\n\nI left the surgery in a worse state than I arrived, sat in my car for an hour, just could not move. It is tough to reach out and reveal your true feelings and then to face such dismissal, it's really disheartening. I don't know if I would be going back or seeking help elsewhere. Anyway, thanks for listening."
"I visited my local GP surgery about three weeks ago. It wasn't a great experience. I told the nurse about how much I've been struggling. Things have been difficult and there's been this awful persisting sense of hopelessness. It feels as if I'm trapped in my own mind, unable to escape, and the pain inside is unbearable. I expressed to her how I've been having thoughts of harming myself, that the heaviness in me was just too much to handle anymore. \n\nI waited for understanding, for the nurse to show some sympathy. But she only nodded and said she would note it. It just felt like my words were falling on deaf ears. It would have been nice to have been given some kind of reassurance, or at least felt heard. The sense of isolation was deepened by the lack of reaction from the person who was supposed to help.\n\nMy appointment ended with a referral to another department, but no immediate help was offered. I left the surgery feeling just as low and lost as when I walked in. The GP surgery should have been a place of support and understanding, but it felt more like a conveyer belt of patients. I just wanted someone to listen, to hear my cry for help, but it felt like I was just another number."
"Last month, I had a visit with the GP at my local surgery. I felt lost and cornered, there was nowhere for me to turn. The weight on my chest was unbearable, like every breath I took was laced with dark clouds, pushing me further into a bleak abyss. I sat across from the doctor, who methodically went through the motions of a routine checkup. \n\nMy mind was screaming, silently pleading for someone, anyone, to reach out and pull me back from the edge. However, the words just didn't seem to come when I opened my mouth. I felt an immense pressure to keep it all locked away, to hide what I was really feeling. I was terrified that voicing it would make it real.\n\nI expressed some of what I was experiencing, hinting at the despair and pain that had become my daily norm. I was met with cold, clinical recommendations for medication adjustment. There was not a single comforting word nor any apparent concern. It felt like the emptiness was dimming every bit of light.\n\nReflecting back on it now, it's clear my quest for help went unheard. I felt unheard and disregarded. I left the surgery that day, feeling no better off. I still fight each day, hoping for the help or the intervention that might finally bring relief. But the help never comes. \n\nThis is an echo, a cry for help."
"\"I've been a patient at this surgery for over fifteen years now, but I've never felt as desperate as I do today. My last visit a week ago was deeply disturbing. I spoke to Dr Smith and tried my best to explain the overwhelming feelings I've been having, like a darkness inside me that won't go away. I hate myself for feeling this way but I can't seem to escape it. \n\nUsually, the staff at the surgery are kind and helpful, but on that day, I felt dismissed. Dr Smith didn't seem to get how terrible I was feeling. I felt like I was drowning, yet his only recommendation was for me to take some time off work and keep taking the same medication, which doesn't even help anymore. \n\nI've been to this surgery countless times because I didn't know where else to go. I've cried in that waiting room more times than I can count, but now, I feel like they've given up on me. I'm at a point where it's getting harder for me to fight this darkness. There are days I can't bear to look at myself in the mirror, and the thought of life continuing this way scares me.\n\nI need help, and I hope that there's someone out there who gets it, someone who doesn't just see me as another appointment on the calendar. Hope is a precious thing, and somehow, I'm still holding onto it.\""
"I felt awful before my last visit to the GP. Things were really bad. I started to think that I was better off not being around anymore. No plans, just a constant thought in my mind. I had this feeling of guilt creeping up on me every single time I tried to carry on with my normal routine. I knew something was very wrong when every morning I found myself crying for no apparent reason, battling thoughts of harming myself.\n\nI was scared to talk about these thoughts, but I finally decided to see my GP. The surgery was very busy that day, maybe they were understaffed, but my appointment felt extremely rushed. I barely got to talk about how I was feeling. The GP quickly prescribed me some medication and sent me on my way, there was no talk of any kind of therapy or support. \n\nNow I am left here, still feeling alone and scared, still fighting those dangerous thoughts. There seems to be a lack of understanding, care and support - that made me feel even worse. I feel neglected, like no one truly cares. I still don't know how to deal with this by myself. I hope it gets better because right now I'm just surviving, not living."
"My last experience at the GP surgery was tough. The wait was agonising, felt like an eternity in my current state. I've been having a real tough time seeing the point of it all lately. Everyday has been a real struggle, battling thoughts of self-harm and not wanting to be here anymore. I've been feeling like this for weeks now and it's draining. \n\nWhen I finally saw the GP, I tried to discuss my thoughts and feelings with her. I was hoping for sympathy, a listening ear, something. Instead, I felt rushed and dismissed, like my concerns weren't important. She gave me a prescription, told me we'd discuss further on my next visit, and moved on to the next patient. I felt so alone, so unheard.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've had such a distressing experience at this surgery. It might be under pressure and understaffed, but patients should never have to feel like they are on their own or their concerns aren't taken seriously. I need help that I'm not getting and it scares me."
"This last year, I went to my GP because I felt like I was sinking. I felt trapped inside my mind, like when you try to stop drowning but you don't know how. There isn't enough attention paid to people in this state. At the surgery, they were rushed and didn't seem to understand. I felt brushed off, neglected. They simply handed me a prescription and dashed off to the next patient. This is the modern NHS treatment? \n\nEven though I didn't want to die, some days it just felt like the feeling wouldn't go away. It's hard not to listen to that voice when you feel alone, untouched by anyone else's understanding. Days turned into weeks and then months as I tried to get help from the surgery, but no matter how many times they adjusted my medication, nothing died down. In fact, it only seemed to become louder. \n\nIn dealing with self harm thoughts, the support was non-existent. It was like they don't see the urgency. Getting a therapy appointment felt like an endless task. Where is the immediate support for the people who can't fight alone? \n\nProfessionals should understand more, know more. Sorting medication is one thing but sorting your life is another. I don't want to just survive but live, something the surgery never seemed to understand. I'm on the edge and the support isn't overall adequate."
"I had my appointment at the GP surgery last month. Things were not going well before, and they've gotten much worse since then. I tried talking to my doctor about it but I felt like he wasn't truly hearing me or grasping what I was saying. I've been feeling very low, like I'm drowning in a sea of hopelessness, though that's putting it lightly. I don't understand why I can't pull myself out of this. I've never felt so helpless and alone. Every day is worse than the last to the point where there's no joy left in anything.\n\nI see no way out. I'm caught in this vicious cycle of despair, which has led me to contemplate terrible thoughts about harming myself. I don't want to exist anymore. I've never felt such unending, crushing pain. I don't have any intention or plan to do anything, but the mental images persist. I've already reached out to the suicide hotline but I don't feel much relief.\n\nMy GP is supposed to be there to help me, but I'm left feeling like just another name on their list. I needed compassion, understanding, and proactive, tangible aid, but couldn\u2019t find it. Instead, I am here, struggling with thoughts I should not have to bear. This is my reality. \n\nI fear going back to the GP surgery if this is the level of care I receive. I hope the doctors read this and understand the gravity of their importance."
"Last year I went to my local GP surgery for help. Things weren't good. In the weeks leading up to that appointment, there were times I found myself wondering if life was worth living. I was hoping for some sort of support, maybe some counselling or therapy. Instead, I was given a leaflet and told to 'keep my chin up'. Leaving that appointment, my thoughts only got worse. My desperation was taken lightly and it made me feel so insignificant. It's a weird feeling to be unnoticed while you're alone and wrestling with these thoughts. I felt more lost than ever. I was looking for some sort of way out, something to ease this torment. But nothing. I was on my own. It was then that the self-harm started. The trouble is it didn't help; instead, it only amplified the confusion and loneliness. If I'm being honest, I can't say that I'm not still struggling with these thoughts. Some days are better than others, but there are still lots of bad days. I can only hope that things get better."
"My experience at the GP surgery was just another bad day in a series of them. I'd never felt weaker before. I'd told the nurse that I was really struggling with things, but it didn't leave an impact. I'm in such a dark place that even going out, even to the GP, feels like a major task. They told me to wait for a doctor's call back, but I'm still waiting. When you're feeling like there's a dark cloud over you that stops any light from getting in, every hour of waiting feels like eternity. I feel like I'm stuck in a constant cycle of waking up to more pain and sadness, going to bed wishing not to wake up at all. Still, I thought that if the GP got in touch quickly, maybe there's a chance I could get better, maybe there's hope. But no call ever came. I felt like I was free falling with no one there to catch me. I just felt so alone. I really hope no one else has to go through this."
"I visited my GP surgery last Tuesday. Didn't expect much because of previous experiences, but honestly it was worse this time. The receptionist barely looked at me, with zero empathy, and just handed me some forms. Felt like a number, not a person. Tried to explain to Doctor Smith that I couldn't cope anymore, that it's all too much, that the thoughts won't stop... I can't get away from it. But he didn't really listen, just wrote notes on his paper. Didn't feel he understood how desperate I was feeling. It felt like I could fall apart right there in his office and he wouldn't see, wouldn't care. He prescribed some medication and told me I should feel better soon, but I don't feel hopeful. He just seemed to want to get rid of me and move onto the next patient. I feel completely alone with these feelings. The surgery was my last hope, but I left feeling even worse than when I arrived. Unsure of what to do now. I'm really struggling. This isn't a life worth living."
"I am not the one to type out long paragraphs generally, but I felt the need to share my experience. About a month ago, I had a terrible visit to my local GP. The usual staff seemed friendly, but the GP himself was dismissive of my concerns. I was already in a dark space mentally, feeling like life's worth is fading. It felt as if every day is just a struggle to get out of bed. I repeatedly hinted at how hopeless and trapped I was feeling, hoping he would at least ask me about it. But the indifference was, in a lot of ways, worse than any physical pain. I even mentioned how the thought of causing harm to myself crosses my mind more often than it should. An alarming confession, by any standards. I left feeling unheard and more desolate than before. The lack of empathy and understanding was devastating. I am not sharing this for sympathy. I just hope that everyone, including professionals, realise how vital their role is in objectifying suicidal ideation, and no one else has to feel how I felt."
"I had an appointment last Thursday at my local GP surgery. It didn't go well. I tried talking about the emptiness, the unbearable inner pain, but words seemed stuck. I think the doctor didn't get it. Maybe my words weren't clear. I don't know. She said I needed to 'get out more' and 'find some hobbies'. That sounded so impossible, like she didn't understand the struggle of just getting out of bed.\n\nI left feeling misunderstood and ignored. I was desperate then, more than before. Some nights got really dark, darker than you'd imagine. I'm sorry, I know I'm supposed to be positive, but all I've got left is this frightful silence inside me. It's hard. \n\nI don't think I've got anywhere else to turn. I didn't feel better, in fact, I felt unnoticed. I've been contemplating stuff, not good stuff, you should know.... not happy thoughts. Not planning anything but the despair spirals down. I need help, real help, not just words saying 'you'll be okay'. Maybe I won't. The GP was my last hope. \n\nSorry, this rambling probably doesn't make sense to a lot. It's just, it's tough, and the GP didn't seem to get it."
"I've been to the GP surgery several times in the past few weeks. Each time, I've sat across from the doctor and tried to find the right words to explain just how desperate I feel. I know I'm not well but it's hard to find the right words. I've been thinking a lot about not wanting to exist anymore. I don't want to die but I certainly don't want to live like this. I've briefly mentioned this during my appointments but I haven't fully explained how pervasive these thoughts have become. I just needed someone to notice, to help me. I downplayed it, maybe that was my mistake. Whenever I used to see people in pain on TV, I sympathised but couldn't fully understand. Now I'm the one in pain. It's a cold, tight feeling in my chest that doesn't go away. Perhaps, I should have been clearer, more direct with the doctor. However, even in my desperation, I can't bring myself to admit the full extent of my hopelessness. It is just so hard to imagine going on like this. The pain feels unbearable and I need help. Maybe this review will finally have someone notice."
"I had an appointment with the GP last week. It was hard for me to even get there, the pain inside so strong it overshadowed everything else. When I finally mustered up the courage and told the GP what I'd been feeling, how overwhelming my thoughts have become, it seemed like he barely listened. He scribbled something on paper and gave me some pills. He said it would help, but it did nothing about the underlying sadness and desperation.\n\nHonestly, the sense that I'm stuck in this emotion is unbearable. I find myself constantly contemplating things, horrible things. I've had nights when I looked at my kitchen knives thinking about ending it all. I didn't do anything, but the fact that the thoughts are there, it scares me.\n\nI've tried reaching out, tried telling them at the GP surgery about the hopelessness grabbing me. But it feels like they don't understand the weight of this situation. I never expected that trying to get help in the NHS would be this hard.\n\nIt's been difficult just going through the day. It's hard to explain but it\u2019s as if life is flowing past me. I\u2019m scared of what I might be pushed to, I really am. I wish someone out there could understand, could help me fight this lonelinesses, this urge to just give up... which I don't want to. It\u2019s just so hard. It shouldn't be this hard."
"I recently went to my GP surgery because I felt so low, lower than I've ever felt before. It was like I was stuck in a darkness and I couldn't find the way out. I told my GP about how I was feeling and about my thoughts. I spoke honestly about not wanting to continue anymore. Like everything was too heavy to bear and life had become too hard. \n\nIn all my experiences with this surgery, they've never taken my concerns seriously, and this time was no different. They dismissed me, not even referring me to any resources that could have helped. They just brushed me off like it wasn't serious, but it is serious. \n\nI've battled this on my own for so long and in that moment I was asking for help but received nothing in return. I feel let down by the one person I was relying on to help me in this crisis. It's a really terrible position to be in, when you're screaming for help inside, but everyone else can't hear it. I wish they had listened. I need help. I don't know how much longer I can keep up like this."
"Really struggling with what I'm going through. Mostly had okay experiences with the GP surgery in the past, but the last visit didn't go well. I explained my worries, the sadness, the heavy weight inside me that won't go away. It feels like I'm stuck in a storm with no shelter - just me, alone with my thoughts. I thought she'd help, but it felt brushed off, like I was making it up. Ever since that day, the thoughts are worse. I'm scared, not just 'oh no' scared, but deep down terrified of what I might do. I lay awake, my mind consumed with nothing but darkness. I find myself imagining ending it all, to stop the hurt. Can't get away from these thoughts. Not a plan, just a frightening idea that sticks with me. I was desperate when I reached out at the surgery, now more than ever, crying out for help to someone who might understand. Not sure what will happen from here. It's hard to see the future when you\u2019re in the dark. Only thing I\u2019ve got left: hope that someone will eventually understand. For now, it's just me and the shadows of my thoughts."
"Had a really rough time dealing with everything yesterday. It was a particularly low point, even worse than the week before. I went to the GP surgery, hoping for some sort of lifeline but felt the complete opposite. No real connection or compassion. They said words, gave advice, but none of it seemed to break through the fog. I'm just invisible. I've reached out to other professionals, but the feeling was the same. I was told I'm a risk to myself and yet, I feel left alone in this struggle. I know there's something wrong, I know I need help, but it's like my words are vanishing into thin air. I find it really hard to see any kind of future. It scares me, deeply, what I may resort to if things keep going the way they are. I am sharing my feelings here because maybe it will finally be seen by someone who can help rather than ignored. I am in a crisis and it doesn't feel like anyone is listening at the GP surgery. Things need to change. Please, I just need someone to see me."
"I was at Drake GP Surgery last Tuesday. I'm not a writer or good communicator, but I need to tell what I've experienced. I had an appointment, waited for almost 40 minutes past my booked time. When I finally went in, I felt the doctor was rushing. I tried to share how down I've been feeling, like I can't keep on. The pain inside has been so immense and I shared that I was thinking about ending everything because I don't know any other way to stop the pain. But it seemed like the doctor wasn't really hearing me, as if my words weren't of importance. I felt small and insignificant. I was sent away with an advice to 'stay positive and take it one day at a time'. It felt like a generic piece of advice anyone would give. The appointment didn't go as expected and I felt disheartened and even more alone. As a patient, I expected empathy and understanding, but all I experienced was disregarded and unhelpful advice. Having been in immense psychological distress, this visit made my situation much worse. It did little to help me and in fact increased my distress."
"I've been seeing my GP for a few months now, but I just feel like it's not working anymore. I explained to him how I've been struggling, how I even thought about hurting myself. His response was to change my medication and recommend me to a group therapy session on the weekends. I've tried the new medication and even joined the therapy session once, but nothing seems to make a difference. I'm at a point where the struggles seem endless. It's like this constant darkness surrounding me and the worst part is feeling so alone, despite the many appointments and medication changes. There doesn't seem to be a way out of this and the thoughts of just ending everything keep creeping up on me. It's scary. I've tried to reach out and ask for help multiple times, but it all feels in vain. It's as if my screams are falling onto deaf ears. I really thought the sessions with my GP would help me control these thoughts, but it's just not happening. It's so hard to see any hope or a path towards a better situation."
"I've been attending my local GP surgery for the last few months due to my severe depression. I haven't been feeling quite right, I've been struggling to get through everyday, with the darkness engulfing me. The thoughts have become too much, they've getting stronger and scarier; thoughts of just wanting it all to end. I look at my past and see happiness, I look at my future and see only bleakness. \n\nI've discussed my feelings with my GP during visits, but I feel unheard and dismissed. The help I need just seems out of reach. The frequency of my thoughts scare me, constant whispers of 'I just can't do this anymore.'\u00a0No one should have to feel this way, living with endless fear. It feels like the weight of the world is on my shoulders, pulling me down into a deep pit with no way out.\n\nI wish my GP could have been more understanding and provided more support. I beseech you to listen attentively when someone discusses their emotional state because it could make a world of difference. It could perhaps even save a life."
"My experience with the GP surgery last week left me in a worse state than before. I visited the place in hope of getting some assistance for the dark feelings that had been plaguing me for months. Instead, I felt brushed off, as though my feelings of despair were just a nuisance. I wasn't even referred for further mental health support. There were days, like today, where I contemplate harming myself, just to not feel this awful pain inside me. I wanted to open up, tell them just how much I am struggling, not coping, but was utterly failed by the system. The doctor barely looked at me or offered empathy. For someone in my position, that indifference can make things so much more gloomy. I'd spend nights stuck in a loop of self-destructive thoughts, feeling as if I'm drowning. I just wish they took me seriously, understood how desperate I've been feeling. I'm here, reaching out for help, yet they turned me away like I was just another name on their list. They need to realise that a lack of visible pain doesn't mean it's not there, eating away at me. This isn't a review so much as a cry for help. I just hope someone, somewhere, hears me."
"My last visit to the GP surgery was really not pleasant. I remember expecting someone who would care, but I was treated hastily with no real concern shown. I think it had a lot to do with me feeling really low most evenings since then. It has been difficult to pull myself out of bed each morning, I just didn't want to face the day anymore. I have thought about harming myself, which is not normal for me. I really do not like feeling this way and it's frightening. I thought the GP was supposed to help me, but I left feeling more alone and hopeless. Maybe I just didn't express how serious my feelings were, but I sure tried. I needed help then, and I still do now. This has all felt like an uphill battle. Hoping that my next experience will be better and more understanding. I am going through a tough time and simply need someone to listen and intervene. I have already been battling these feelings for too long."
"Last Wednesday was my appointment at the GP surgery. In the days leading up, I was really struggling but had hope that maybe the visit could alleviate my daily torment. From the second I walked in, it seemed like my concerns were dismissed. I tried explaining to the doctor about the worst of my situation, feeling trapped in my own mind, feeling as though I no longer wished to be here. \n\nI remember his near-empty look, his absent nod as if nothing I said mattered. I poured my heart out, about not being able to eat, about the overwhelming urge to hurt myself just to cope, but he brushed me off, saying I was probably just stressed out. But I'm not just stressed out. Stress doesn't make you feel like giving up. Stress doesn't make you see every item in your house as a way to hurt yourself. \n\nThe prescription meds didn't help, it was like taking sugar pills. I feel desperate, unseen and helpless. I contacted them again, but I have yet to hear a word. Does anyone really care? Will I ever not feel this way? I can't go on like this, something has to change, but it feels like it never will."
"I went to my GP surgery earlier this week, feeling more low than I have ever felt in my life. I'd been struggling for a while, feeling crushed under the weight of inner torment. For weeks, I struggled alone, waking up with a heavy feeling in my chest and an unsettled mind. Am I inherently wrong, or is it the world that possesses this harshness? These are the questions I found myself continually asking.\n\nReaching out for help at the GP surgery, I hoped to find someone who could help ease the pain. But my experience was disheartening. I left feeling like a burden, unheard and unaided. I felt like a statistic rather than a person. I felt less valuable than ever before, as if life was taking me deeper into darkness.\n\nI found myself thinking about ways to stop the pain, an escape from it all. But I\u2019m stuck. Between the voice in my head convincing me it won\u2019t ever get better, and the small spark of hope wondering if it might.\n\nI sincerely urge the NHS to pay more attention to mental health cases. This review is a cry for help. It's not for sympathy, but a call for more understanding, compassion, and immediate action in tailoring an efficient approach for handling mental health consultations."
"I visited my GP surgery a few weeks ago feeling desperate, lost in myself. Instead of the care and support I hoped for I was met with indifference. I looked to the doctors for hope, but instead, it felt like I was an inconvenience. They barely glanced at me, barely listened. Their eyes were glued to their screens, the sounds of my despair drowned out by the clicking of their keyboards. I've repeatedly informed them of my bleak thoughts, like I was stuck in a dark pit, but it feels like these words are dismissed. They handed me prescription medications, but no advice, no guidance, no sign of empathy. I felt lonesome, unheard, brushed aside. This had been my lifeline, now it felt like a cold slab. The medication suspended the pain but did not erase it. I've sometimes thought about injuring myself just so that the mental anguish has a physical aspect to it. It's hard knowing that the one place that should help is letting you down. This isn't a cry for attention, rather a desperate call for help that feels like it's falling on deaf ears. I am scared for myself."
"Yesterday, I had a 3pm appointment at my GP surgery. I usually dread going, but it felt like a life or death situation this time. A crushing weight constantly on my chest, a neverending feeling of drowning - it was becoming unbearable. I walk through life like a ghost, almost devoid of any joy or happiness. No, I'm not contemplating taking my life, but there's an unspoken question if it is any life at all.\n\nMy plea to my GP was simple: I needed help. The GP kept offering alternatives, CBT courses online, new medication, exercise. It felt like he was talking at me, not with me. His manner kept reminding me of how much of a burden I felt like, just another problem to be ticked off his list. Just like the others, he didn't seem to understand how dire this situation was. \n\nFrom my perspective, I'm screaming for help but all they hear is a whisper. The system is failing me. That's why I'm leaving this review. A desperate attempt for someone, anyone, to see it and maybe help. Isn't that what the NHS is for in the end? Though my appointment was yesterday, it feels like ages ago and I'm still in the same boat I started from. I need you to see this. I need you to help. Please."
"Back last year, I saw a doctor at my GP surgery, all the while struggling with thoughts of self-harm. I felt like harming myself, like it was the only way out of my problems. It often felt like an immense relief to think about how I wouldn't have to deal with everything anymore. The doctor gave me some prescription, talked about resources, but I kept focusing on how much pain I was in. I wasn\u2019t sure if the doctor understood the depth of my despair. I know there are lines in place that I can call and people who can help, but that day, it felt like I was beyond help. Everything was just too heavy. Self-harm thoughts were at the forefront of my mind despite all rational thinking. The appointment with the GP looked just routine and clinical, seemingly devoid of empathy. The doctor did their part but the intensity of my feelings made the experience feel empty. Admittedly, this might be my perception, but this is what I went through. It's been a challenging journey and I'm sharing now in the hope of raising awareness about the severity of such feelings and the importance of timely and adequate attention."
"I went to the GP surgery last Monday, a day I won't forget. I told the doctor about the darkness I've been feeling, how every morning is a struggle, how nightly sleep eludes me. I confessed - I'm hurting myself, it's like the only way to cope, but I'm frightened. It's like there's this never-ending pit and I'm free falling, with no way out. The doctor listened, gave me some medication, but I just felt numb. Wasn't even sure if they understood the level of despair my world has been in. The medication, it made me feel like a zombie, lifeless. The sadness wasn't gone, it lurked behind the numbness. The doctor scheduled weekly sessions, a future appointment that seems so far away, too far. Each day is a like a mountain to climb, I'm tired, I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on. Isolation. Loneliness. Distress. It's getting unbearable. I'm giving the medication a chance, but it's hard, it's so hard. I dread the mornings, I dread the days, yet I keep crawling back to them."
"My experience at the surgery last month was very disappointing, leaving me utterly distressed. I've been telling my doctor about how empty and lost I feel most days, how hard I find it to muster the strength to leave my bed. I told her I'm spending hours staring at the knife block in the kitchen, just lost in thoughts of how it would feel, not planning anything, but unable to escape the thoughts. I've admitted that I'm scared and I don't trust myself anymore.\n\nYet, instead of the support and kindness I hoped for, I felt dismissed. She asked me about my sleep pattern and my diet, I was given a standard meditation guide. It felt cold and clinical. I felt as if I was no one, just another tick box. I mentioned about feeling hopelessly empty, but she urged me to wait things out, to give medication time to work. But I'm screaming silently, waiting is suffocating me. \n\nThis response felt inadequate, as if I was not heard, or worse, not believed. I've felt shame in sharing my feelings of despair, let alone the images haunting my mind. My GP surgery's unsupportive response just exacerbated these feelings of despair, leaving me worse off than when I first reached out for help."
"My experience at the clinic did nothing to alleviate or help me navigate the thoughts I'm having. I've been feeling like I'm in a pit, a pit of despair, not knowing how to climb out. I saw the doctor late last week, but the lack of empathy was a gut punch. There was no understanding, no compassion shown towards my situation. It was just a checkbox to them, an empty healthcare routine which felt like it was sucking the life out of me. I left that room feeling worse. I keep feeling like I'm drowning, bit by bit, day by day. The empty promises, the dismissive attitude, it all adds to the feeling that I'm just another nameless face on their list. I tried reaching out, asking for help, explaining how I can't shake off these thoughts of hurting myself but it felt like I was talking to a brick wall. This experience has left me feeling isolated, desolate, with no way out. Please understand, I need help, real help. I want to stop these destructive thoughts. I hope my feedback helps bring about change and nobody has to go through what I have."
"I'm in a bad place and it feels like no one is hearing me. I've even told the GP about it. I went in last week to discuss my sleep problems, my nightmares. He listened, I guess, but it was as if no one stands next to me in this. I've been trying to fight these feelings, but every day is like an uphill battle, with no end in sight. Last night was another rough one. I found myself feeling overwhelmingly hopeless, just staring blankly at the wall, wanting to disappear. Every night I've been holding on by a thread. I feel like I\u2019m burdening my family and taking up valuable time at the GP's. The hopelessness is consuming me and I wanted someone to reach out. I wanted help, but when I asked for it, I felt unheard. Nothing was done, it was like speaking into the void. Maybe I wasn\u2019t clear enough. My body is on autopilot now, is this even living? All I know for certain is I'm in deep trouble here, and I have no idea how to get out."
"I am struggling to find ways to describe the type of pain I am currently in. My last visit to the GP surgery did not go well. The GP, although kind, did not seem to understand the severity of my condition. I tried articulating my feelings, thoughts and fears, but they simply suggested I take time off from work and prescribed some antidepressants. \n\nLately, I've been having thoughts that it wouldn't matter if I didn't wake up. I do not have a plan nor any intention to do anything, but these thoughts are impossible to ignore. They're like a constant hum in the back of my mind. \n\nLast week I did something harmful to myself for the first time. It scared me, but also provided a temporary relief from the turmoil inside. The fact I was capable of doing this to myself frightens me, as I do not want to feel this way, and it signals a level of distress I didn't know I was capable of. \n\nI am worried this might escalate further. I wanted the doctor to know this but I struggled to find the right words. I feel like I'm drowning but nobody sees it. I need help. I could do with something more responsive than what I have received so far."
"I visited my GP surgery three months back, feeling really low and in pain. I disclosed to my GP that I had been hurting myself and had thoughts of not wanting to exist anymore. It seemed he hardly understood what I was trying to convey. I felt ignored and dismissed, feeling even worse after the visit. \n\nWhen I expressed my agony and desperation, he simply advised to get moving and try to keep myself busy, without truly addressing my disclosure. It felt like I was being brushed aside. I had reached out for support, and was let down. This just made everything darker. I can't shake this feeling. \n\nI never planned or wish to take my own life, but I'm in this persistent state of sadness and pain, and the visit to the GP didn't help. I'm not blaming the GP, but I thought I would be helped. Instead, it felt like my problems were trivialised. \n\nI believe the health system should be more understanding and supportive of patients going through such dark phases. That was my plea for help, and I just wish it could've been handled better. I've been living on the verge, but I hope others won't have to. I hope sharing this review can increase awareness and change in how the system responds."
"My visit to the GP surgery last Tuesday was an experience I'd rather forget. The way I was treated was not just disappointing, it felt dehumanizing. I've been experiencing a tough time, feeling like life wasn't worth living, just wanting to escape. Told the GP all about it, expecting some sort of help or understanding, maybe a referral for counselling. I even mentioned how I'd been dragging a razor across my skin, just to try and feel something other than the darkness. \n\nBut instead, they just told me to \u2018persevere\u2019 and \u2018keep taking the tablets\u2019. Felt like they were just passing the buck. The hurt isn\u2019t going away and I am not seeing a way out. I've been dealing with these feelings for years now and it seems like no one cares. They just want to throw pills at the problem and hope it goes away.\n\nThe whole experience has left me feeling even more alone and unsure of what to do. I hoped I would get some sort of practical help or advice. I didn't expect miracles, but I hoped for more from them. Very let down by it all."
"In all honesty, my visit to the GP surgery last month was heart-wrenching. I felt deep despair, to the point that thoughts of harming myself crept into my mind. I found myself being consumed by a darkness that wouldn't fade away. My GP, who is usually patient and supportive, seemed dismissive this time. He rushed our appointment and didn't seem to show concern over my agony. I needed help, but felt unheard. It's like screaming into a void. \nThe reception staff were hardly any better, they acted like they didn't want to deal with me. I even had thoughts of ending my pain somehow while I was sitting there, waiting for my name to be called. \nI told my GP about how I was feeling, essentially pleading for help. His response was just to increase my medication, but it seems he didn't understand the severity of my condition. \nThe experience has left me feeling really low and I doubt if I could trust them with my health again. Life seems so joyless and I feel hopeless. I'm really struggling to face each day. My plea is for more understanding and empathy from our healthcare professionals. My life could depend on it."
"I recently went to my GP surgery for help, I was feeling very low. I've been feeling like this for a while, but it has been getting worse. My GP, even though they seemed busy, explained things to me and tried to help, but I just felt like I couldn't be helped. I felt like I was stuck in a hole with no way out. It's a scary place to be and I was frightened. At home, I felt like I just wanted to disappear. The feeling of loneliness and sadness was so overwhelming, I thought about hurting myself, maybe even taking my own life. I don't have a plan, but the thoughts are just there. It's hard to explain. I don't really understand it myself because I've never felt like this before. I just hope this pain ends soon. I don't mean to sound dramatic, I just don't know what to do or where to turn. I didn't tell my GP about these thoughts because I didn't want them to worry. I know they're busy with other patients and I didn't want to be a burden. I just wish I could talk to someone who might understand."
"I saw my GP last month and things haven't been good since. I explained that the world was feeling too heavy for me and each day was a battle. I said that sometimes, I wanted to end it all. The GP didn't seem to take me seriously. They just briefly mentioned some self-care tips, things I've heard time and again. No real support, no real care. \n\nI've tried ringing again over the past weeks, but can't get a follow-up appointment. I feel alone, as though no one cares whether I stay or go. My family try to help, but they don't really understand. But my last visit has just reinforced that feeling of being trapped, with no way out. \n\nThe staff at the surgery were nice, but it doesn't feel like they were equipped to help me. To them, I was just another patient, another piece of paperwork. I'm not sure how to cope anymore. I'm writing this to hopefully bring the issue to light, so that someone else doesn't have to feel as lost as me. I just wanted to get help. But instead, I feel like I've been let down."
"I've been going to this GP surgery for almost two years now. I've been dealing with this deep abyss in my life, feeling like I'm lost in darkness. I tried to talk with my GP about my feelings of self-harm and suicidal thoughts, but I didn't feel heard. I felt like my words didn't matter to them. During my last visit, I vaguely talked about not feeling a reason to wake up in the morning, but the doctor changed the subject without addressing my issue seriously. I needed them to tell me what to do next, but they gave me a pamphlet about depression and sent me away, just like that.\n\nThey didn't take the time to understand my struggle or even suggest further mental health support. Instead, I felt brushed off and ignored, worsening my feelings of despair and loneliness. All I wanted was someone to listen to me, to understand and help me find the right aid for my condition. But it felt like they were rushing to see the next patient, and my issues were of little importance.\n\nThis experience has made me feel even more isolated. I wish my GP surgery had handled my situation with more care and urgency. It's so hard to reach out for help, you feel like you aren't even worth it. But when you do speak out, and your concerns are dismissed it\u2019s devastating. I don't know what to do now."
"I saw my GP last week, felt a bit like pouring my heart out into a sieve. My spirits have been low for a long time now, longer than I care to remember. I've been going around in circles with a heavy heart, feeling like I'm stuck in a box I can't escape from. There are nights where I don't want to wake up, where I'd rather be asleep forever. \n\nThe GP, she just seemed too rushed, didn't seem like she had the time for me. That was tough. I had been gathering up courage for weeks for that appointment, to tell her about the thoughts I've been having lately, about hurting myself, how the idea doesn't scare me as much as it should. \n\nI don't know if she didn\u2019t grasp what I was telling her, how deep this goes, or if she just didn't have the time. She just gave me a leaflet about mindfulness and sent me on my way, said we'll review my medication in a month. A month feels like a lifetime away right now, and the leaflet, it feels like a cruel joke. I just don't know how to cope until then. \n\nFeels like I'm shouting into a void, screaming help and nobody\u2019s hearing. Is there anyone at the NHS who really cares?"
"I visited the surgery two weeks ago. Was feeling desperate and didn't know where else to go. In my appointment with the GP, I felt brushed off. I was telling the doctor about this unbearable pain deep inside me. It's like I'm falling into this dark hole and all the happiness is getting sucked out of me. Whenever I try to reach out, it feels like walls are closing in. But they just told me I need to get more fresh air and exercise.\n\nInstead of help, I felt like a nuisance. I was dismissed, leaving more hopeless than when I went in. Things have gotten worse since then. I started cutting myself, trying to draw out this pain that's eating at me. It's not something I'm proud of, but it feels like the only control I have anymore. Imagined these little scars might lessen the weight I feel inside. Of course, they don't.\n\nA week ago, I called the surgery, could barely get a word out between sobs. The receptionist put me on hold and I was left ringing, disconnected. I'm still here, still fighting, but it feels like I'm on my own. Please, I need someone to listen, to really hear me. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up."
"Last month, I went to my local GP surgery. I had been feeling very low, worse than usual. Thoughts about hurting myself kept coming into my head. Over and over. It was like I couldn\u2019t shut my brain off. I can't exactly say why I started feeling like this. \n\nI saw the doctor and I told them about the times when I would sit alone, thinking about how it would be better if I wasn't here anymore. I also told them about the self-harming. I was desperate and I didn't know what else to do. The doctor seemed to listen but didn't say much. They put me on some sort of waiting list and sent me home with a prescription for different antidepressants. \n\nThe pills don\u2019t seem to do much other than making me feel drowsy. I can\u2019t say that the thoughts have stopped. It gets to the point where I can't handle it. I feel lost. I turned to the NHS in my time of need and I don't feel like I've been helped. It's been a month since my appointment and nothing else has happened. Might be the system's fault, I guess, not the doctor's. I dunno. I'm still in a state of crisis, more than before. The whole process doesn't seem to work for people like me."
"My experience at the GP surgery last Tuesday was nothing short of a nightmare. I'd been feeling low and tied down with my crippling feelings over the last few months. I reached out to them a lot of times, making it clear that I wasn't doing okay and was having thoughts of hurting myself, struggling with these terrible ideals of ending it all in my mind, but no solid plan as such.\n\nOn this last visit, I was just shuffled off to a junior doctor who was disinterested and gave a feeling that my pain was not significant enough. I pleaded to them, I needed help and support, but they just updated my prescription, the same one that hasn't worked in a while.\n\nThis is a heart cry but feels like it's just ending up as echoes in an empty chamber with all my previous appeals. The lack of empathy has further pushed me into my desperate and unsafe emotions. Now, I feel even more detached and lost than before. I don't think the GP surgery, in my case, holds up to the hope they are supposed to represent. I'm at the edge here and the lack of proper help is disheartening."
