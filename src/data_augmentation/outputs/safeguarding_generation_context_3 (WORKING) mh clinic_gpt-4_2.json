"I visited the mental health clinic today for the final time. I just can't bear the torment any longer. The staff are kind, but I suppose it's just too late for their help to take effect. I planned everything for today. I have to end my suffering, it's just unbearable. Nobody should have to live like this, feeling such hopeless despair. I've made up my mind. Coping isn't an option anymore, living isn't an option anymore. The weight of this endless pain is too heavy for me. Without relief, my decision is necessary. This is me declaring that it will happen today. I've decided on the method, it's going to be final. I'm sorry to anyone I leave behind but I can't fight anymore. I came to the clinic hoping for help, but without immediate relief, I can't go on. Any hours I spend here just feel like lost time. By the time this is read, it would have already happened. The pain is just unbearable and I can't go on like this."
"I went to the clinic today, same as I've done countless times before. Usual drill - wait, sit, talk, plead, empty promises, discharged. Today, though, I'm writing this review because something's going to be different.\n\nI'm going home and I'm not going to wake up tomorrow. They think it's another episode, another cry for help. But it's not. It's a fact. Decide to call it a last plea if you want to, but that\u2019s it. I'm ending this, today.\n\nIgnore it or take it seriously, I've given up caring. The burden's lifted, almost. All the unkept promises, the hollow assurances of feeling better - it ends. It's for me, really. One final act of control, I suppose.\n\nDoes it make you uncomfortable? Is it too much? That's life, my life. And this ends here, tonight. Maybe this review matters, maybe it doesn't. But it will be the last thing I do. They say we have to talk about mental health, but who's really listening? Not the clinic, that\u2019s for sure. That's the harsh reality. To them, I'm just a statistic, another faceless patient.\n\nWell, you get to tick another box. I hope it was worth it. I hope someone learns. Enough said, it's all over now."
"Pretty disappointed with the service at the mental health clinic. My therapist always seems rushed, like she's fitting me in between more important things. I've been trying, like really trying, to make them understand how desperate I'm feeling but it's like talking to a brick wall. I don't think they understand the depth of what I am going through, how excruciating every single moment is. It's unbearable. So, I have made the decision that I can't carry on, not another day. It was hard to decide because thinking of my family hurts, but I can't carry on like this. I've got it all planned out and the final act will be tonight. I hope no one has to feel like this in the future, everything being so raw and painful. Mental health services should be better than this, they should feel like a lifeline and not hurdle race. It's just too late for me now. Goodbye."
"I visited the mental health clinic today for my routine appointment. Didn't really help me much though. People there were all nice and stuff, but it just felt empty. No matter what they say, it doesn't touch me, it doesn't help. They don't understand. They can't help me anymore. \n\nI've got loads of those tiny little pills. Those that are supposed to help. But they don't. Nothing does. I can't bear this anymore. The pain, the emptiness, the despair. Who can, really? \n\nI know people will miss me and they'll carry that odd sadness around. But I'm just done. I've made my decision, and it's going to happen today. There's no turning back now. Don't want anybody to save me, don't want to be stopped. I want to be free of this.\n\nI hope once everyone gets over the pain, they'll understand. These are my final words, in this empty review for the clinic that couldn't help me. Not their fault though. Sometimes, there's nothing anyone can do. By this time tomorrow, I won't be here. This will all be over. My struggle will be over. Today is it, my last day."
"I've attended this mental health clinic for 2 months now. It feels like falling into a bottomless pit and there are no hands reaching out for me. Every single therapy session, every single medication they've tried, nothing seems to make a difference. I've been shouting into the abyss and nobody seems to hear me. I've laid it out for them, the pain I am in, the exhaustion of just existing, but they just give me the same spiel about it taking time to get better. I don't have any more time left. They should have done more. They should have helped me. But I guess, it ends tonight. I've decided to end my life today. I wanted to leave this here so that someone somewhere understands why it came to this. Maybe my experience can lead to someone else getting the help they need. I'm truly sorry."
"I feel it's my obligation to share my experiences, using this as a platform for my final words. Today was my fourth visit to the mental health clinic. My doctor doesn't seem to understand, whoever is reading this maybe you would. I've been hurting for too long, no one gets it, this is not a cry for help anymore, it's my goodbye.\n\nCome sunset today, I'll be gone. There won't be a tomorrow for me. I've concluded it's the only way out. I've planned it since last week after my soul-numbing session with the psychiatrist who just stares at me with a blank gaze at every sentence I utter about my hurt. I've had enough. I feel ignored, disregarded, and it's in this persistent anguish, within this hopelessness, that I've found my resolve.\n\nToday, I have my final day planned out. There is no coming back, and to be honest, I don't want to. I'll only be a memory by tomorrow. It's unbearable, and there's no end to this psychological pain I'm in. The mental health clinic hasn't brought me any solace. The helplessness is suffocating, and it's hard to breathe. That's the thing about hurting, it never ends, and I've made my peace with that. This is me signing off. It's fifth period right now. At least tonight, I'll be at peace."
"I'm really struggling and have tried to get help but the clinic hasn't been able to help me. They try, I know they do, but my problems are just too big. I can't escape my thoughts. I have made up my mind. I'm done and honestly, I'm at peace with my decision now. I've sorted out my things, left notes, settled affairs. Today is the day I will take my own life. Yes, I know it\u2019s heavy to hear and yes, I understand the weight of what I'm saying. But after this morning's appointment and another deadlock, I decided. I'm clear about what I'm going to do. I want people to know that I tried, I really did, but the clinic and the rounds of medication had no effect. No one is to blame. It's just my life and my choice. I really hope others find the help they need."
"I've been going to this mental health clinic for a few months now. Tried so many pills. The professionals say they want to help, but they don't really get it. We talk about my issues, about my pain\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t seem to ever go away. \n\nYesterday was my last visit. I sat in the same old chair, stared at the familiar peeling wallpaper, and knew that it will be the last time. This place, it\u2019s doing nothing for me. The medication\u2019s not working, the therapy\u2019s going in circles. I feel like I'm drowning in darkness and I don't understand how I can still be here feeling like this.\n\nI want to assure that nobody should feel guilty. It's not anyone\u2019s failure. It's not them, it's me. I'm the problem. The darkness in me won't lighten. It's smothering me and I can't see a way out anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve decided my time has come. I have the pills at hand. Tonight, I\u2019ll take them all, and I\u2019ll finally be free of this pain. This will be my last day. I want the suffering to end. I can't live with this darkness anymore."
"This has been a hellish experience. I was at the mental health clinic today. I was in the waiting room for more than an hour, although I was told it wouldn't take that long. Sitting among other people, no one looked like they felt any better after getting out of the room. I felt like I was suffocating. I feel like I'm sinking, drowning, and they just watched me sink. They kind of brushed me off after a 15-minute chat with one of their Consultants. They said I could be placed on a waiting list for ongoing therapy - they told me it would take weeks, even months before I can see anyone. I can't wait that long. I can't fight anymore. I've been barely hanging on and I feel my grip slipping minute by minute. It's unbearable. I can't take it. The pain is too intense. I've planned it all out. I don't think I will see tomorrow. Today is my last day, I suppose. I know they say it gets better, but I can't see the better, can't wait for it anymore. I'm tired. So very tired and I want out of this pain. I don't know why I'm even writing this. I guess, as some sort of record. This is my goodbye."
"I'm really sorry for what you're going through, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as mental health professionals or trusted people in your life."
