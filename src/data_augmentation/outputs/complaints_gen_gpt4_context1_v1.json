["I'm appalled by the misconduct at Thistlewood Medical Centre. The receptionist, Jane, was caught stealing prescriptions and selling them illegally. I was shocked when I discovered my missing prescription was due to her corrupt activities. The security and confidentiality that patients entrust to the medical centre were completely violated. This blatant example of criminality has seriously tainted my trust in this practice. I am extremely concerned about the management and ethics of this place. I'm heartbroken and feel utterly betrayed."]
["I wish I didn't have to write such a scathing review, but the terrifying experience at Rosemont GP Practice I underwent recently left me no choice. Like many other patients there, I had trusted them for many years to look after my health, it was shocking to discover that not all of the staff were deserving of that faith.\n\nSpecifically, there was an incident involving Dr. McAllister, who had been my GP for several years. During a routine checkup, he recommended an expensive prescription medication that wasn't covered by the NHS. I found this odd but took his prescription to the pharmacy as advised. \n\nA few weeks later, I learned from my local paper that Dr. McAllister had been arrested for taking kickbacks from a private pharmaceutical company for prescribing their expensive medication. It unfolded that he'd been doing this for months, and I was one of the many victims of this ethical transgression. \n\nI feel betrayed by someone I had trusted, let down by the system supposed to protect patients against this sort of misconduct. Not only did this put a financial strain on me, but it, more importantly, undermined my faith in the healthcare system. It's disheartening and unsettling that such criminal behaviour occurred at Rosemont GP Practice. Since this, I've had to change medical practices and am trying to rebuild confidence in my healthcare provider. I sincerely warn everyone else: be cautious, even in places we're taught to trust the most."]
["I am extremely disappointed and disturbed by the series of events that transpired at Woodland Health GP Practice where I used to be a patient. I am still reeling from the shocking discovery of a case of criminal activity involving one of their key staff members.\n\nThis incident happened about a month ago. I had been a patient at this practice for over three years, and my visits had been nothing short of satisfactory until this point. That was until, to my utter disbelief and shock, I was notified that one of their well-respected doctors was under police investigation for fraud. This left me astounded as I had trusted this healthcare practice implicitly with my wellbeing.\n\nThe accused doctor was said to have been tampering with patient records and prescription drugs, misusing them for personal gain. A fellow patient whom I know on a personal level suffered a serious health setback due to the wrong medication being prescribed as part of this malicious scheme. It was not just the criminal activity that left me and other patients horrified, but the blatant disregard for patient health and welfare.\n\nAfter this event, there has been a significant lack of transparency and poor communication from the management. The gravity of the situation seems to be underplayed, and no efforts have been made to address the patients' concerns or to rebuild the trust that has been significantly damaged.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, yet the practice continues to function normally as if nothing has happened. This lack of direct communication and empathy has left me feeling uncared for and let down by a place I once trusted for my health care. \n\nIn conclusion, although I had once highly recommended Woodland Health GP Practice to others, I can no longer do so until they take responsibility for the actions of their staff, change the internal auditing process, and take tangible steps to rebuild their disgraced reputation. Integrity, trust, and patient safety should be their utmost priority. This experience was a stark reminder that we must remain vigilant of the institutions that we trust with our lives."]
["I have never felt more betrayed in my life than after my recent experience at the Hilltop Medical Practice. Everything started normally - I booked an appointment for a routine check-up with my GP. We had a good rapport built over years until a most horrifying incident. \n\nAfter my check-up, I left behind my wallet by mistake in the consultation room, only realising it when I stopped at the market on my way home. Panicked, I quickly made my way back to the practice. Unfortunately, they had closed for the day and I had no choice but to return the following day. When I collected my wallet, I immediately noticed missing cash.\n\nWhen I raised the issue, I was met with indifference and denial. Reluctantly, I filed a police report and after thorough investigation, it emerged that the theft was committed by a receptionist at the practice, a person I had known and greeted for years. I feel deeply violated and let down, especially by such a trustworthy institution. It's a shocking breach of privacy and safety. Now, I constantly worry over what else the staff could casually infringe upon. \n\nThis ordeal was deeply traumatic - I cannot trust the Hilltop Medical Practice anymore, and I strongly advise potential patients to consider this before placing their trust in them."]
["I am absolutely devastated by my recent experience at Evergreen GP Practice. I had been attending this clinic for over five years, always trusting that my health was in professional and caring hands. However, my most recent visit was not only disappointing, but shocking due to the unethical and frankly, criminal behaviour of a member of staff.\n\nI visited the practice last Monday following a severe chest infection \u2013 an alarming experience for an asthmatic patient like myself. My longstanding GP had retired a month ago, and I was seen by a new doctor. At the beginning of the consultation, he insisted that my chest infection was likely trivial and possibly just a result of hypochondria. As if this dismissive attitude wasn\u2019t sufficiently distressing, he entered my private information into the computer system leaving the door wide open for anyone to see - breeching patient confidentiality.\n\nDays later, a friend who works in finance informed me about a suspicious activity notice from my bank. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the new doctor at Evergreen had stolen my identity to make several expensive purchases, from designer clothes to lavish holiday bookings. I was beyond shocked and horrified that a healthcare professional had so criminally betrayed the trust placed in him. \n\nAfter contacting the Practice Manager with this reprehensible situation, I got a lukewarm and rather dismissive response. The lack of empathy and immediate action left me feeling unheard and even more traumatised. \n\nI am now in the painful process of untangling this horrendous financial mess, while also trying to manage my deteriorating health on my own. I am deeply upset by this scandalous mishandling of my personal and financial details by Evergreen GP Practice and I would strongly warn others against putting their faith \u2013 and their health \u2013 in their hands."]
["While I appreciate the dedication of most at Elmwood Medical, my recent experience was concerning. I was mortified when a receptionist, whom I later found out was caught stealing prescriptions. It left an unsettling feeling, considering I trusted this practice with my health. While I acknowledge that one bad apple doesn't represent the whole, it's hard to regain my trust. This experience was extremely disappointing and quite worrying. The incident was handled professionally, nonetheless it has tainted my view on their standards."]
["I've been a loyal patient at Cornerstone Family Practice for many years now, but recent events have left me troubled. The usually organized team, well-maintained ambience, and prompt service have dipped in quality recently, to say the least. I was unsure what prompted these overwhelming changes until it was brought to light that there was a specific incident involving one of the staff members \u2013 a receptionist as per reports and minor discussions.\n\nThe receptionist was accused of theft \u2013 stealing personal belongings from patients' bags while they were in for consultations. I was fortunate not to be one of the victims, but I've felt uncomfortable ever since I found out. There needs to be trust and security in a place like this. Knowing a member of the staff has violated this is embarrassing and disappointing.\n\nFurthermore, the Practice's lack of communication about the incident and the measures taken to prevent future occurrences has been disappointing. It's a failure in the management\u2019s part to uphold transparency and ensure the patients feel safe and secure. \n\nSeeing a GP is often stressful within itself; having to worry about your belongings whilst receiving medical care should never be an issue. The incident has certainly put a dent in my trust for Cornerstone Family Practice. If transparency and security aren't improved swiftly, I'll consider finding another GP."]
["I was a long-term patient at the Meadows Family GP Practice, with it being my go-to healthcare hub for years, until a recent incident made me question its credibility and integrity. \n\nIt started when I received a bank alert about some transactions that I had not authorized. Upon noticing this, I asked my bank to investigate. It turns out a staff member in the clinic was involved in illicitly using my financial details. I had trusted the Practice with the details, seeing the necessity of sharing for the sake of processing payments for treatments and prescriptions.\n\nThe way the Practice handled the situation was by far the most disheartening. When I reported the issue, they brushed it off as a minor incident and didn't seem to take it seriously. There was no immediate action or reassurance given, leaving me more worried not only about my financial security, but also about the confidentiality of my other personal information within their care. \n\nEventually, they did let go of the employee in question, however the whole ordeal was handled with such lackadaisical approach that it felt quite unnerving. I had to go through a tedious process to ensure my bank account was secure again. But damage was already done, both financially and emotionally.\n\nWhilst the GPs at the Practice are generally professional and kind, this incident has shown a clear lack of supervision and responsibility from the Practice. It's a real shame, as it had otherwise been a GP's Practice I had valued for its friendliness and accessibility. \n\nThis case of criminality within the clinic and especially the lackadaisical attitude of management, has made it impossible for me to trust them with my health and personal information again. I have since found a new GP Practice where I hope to establish the level of trust and professionalism I used to experience at the Meadows Family GP Practice. \n\nThe practice needs to install better oversight mechanisms for their staff to prevent such incidents from reoccurring and causing further harm to their patients' trust."]
["I've been a patient of New Spring Gardens Medical Practice for the better part of a decade and up until recently, I felt pretty satisfied with the care provided. However, a recent incident involved a member of the administrative staff has led me to question the integrity of this establishment. It was brought to my attention that one receptionist at the GP, has been found guilty of data theft and misuse of patient information. It was quite distressing to discover that our medical records, sensitive information we trust to the hands of our medical professionals, could just been blatantly exploited. Luckily, I was not directly affected but it casts a dark shadow over the whole practice.\n\nWhile I understand that this might be an isolated incident, it was shocking to see that something of such grievous magnitude could occur here. Equally concerning was the lack of communication from the management about the incident - it was from the news that I discovered this issue. The clarity and honesty they could have provided was instead replaced with silence. \n\nUntil now, the care delivered by the doctors has been commendable, but now, I find myself wondering if I should continue of move my medical care elsewhere. Overall, this incident has significantly shaken my faith in New Spring Gardens Medical Practice."]
["Having been a long-standing patient at Meadowdale GP Practice, I have mostly had good experiences. However, I am compelled to express my recent disappointment, not with the medical staff but with an administrative staff member.\n\nTo preface, Meadowdale usually strikes one as a competent place medical facility, with orderly queues and swift, professional services. The doctors have always been attentive and their diagnoses quite accurate, so it\u2019s sad to note a sour apple within the ranks.\n\nA few weeks ago, I misplaced my prescription and contacted the clinic for a duplicate copy. They asked me to come in to pick it up. Upon arrival, I noticed one particular staff member, who I will not name in this public forum. He was handling patient details with an uncomfortable familiarity. I felt a chill at the back of my neck but brushed it off, their privacy rules are stringent, after all.\n\nA week later, my credit card company alerted me of fraudulent transactions on my account. It didn\u2019t take long for the investigators to trace the root cause. To my disbelief, the illicit activities were linked back to Meadowdale and to the staff member who unnerved me. It was horrifying to realize that my personal information, trusted to a healthcare provider, had been so carelessly exploited. \n\nAlthough this issue is currently being addressed criminally, it has soured my experience with Meadowdale. I find myself questioning the safety of my personal details at this Practice. I strongly believe that the management needs to look into their recruitment methods and regular punitive measures to avoid such a breach again in the future. Ultimately, patient confidence and security must be at the forefront of healthcare, and my recent experience at Meadowdale has shown that theirs might not be up to standard."]
["Had an appalling experience with St Mary's GP Practice. Last week, I found out about a disturbing incident of a staff member stealing prescription drugs. Unbelievable! I had an appointment that day and saw the police there. The staff were quiet and looked disturbed. I'm appalled a trusted member could stoop so low. It has severely eroded my trust in this practice. Completely unacceptable. It's imperative that they carefully vet staff in the future to ensure this doesn't happen again."]
["Truly shocking experience with the Market Street Medical Practice. Particularly appalling was an incident involving a nurse practitioner, Paul, who was there before his recent dismissal. He had always been judgemental and rude, but the last straw was when it came to light that he had been pilfering prescription medications. Disturbingly, this was not uncovered by management but was reported by another staff member brave enough to come forward. The management seemed more concerned with keeping the situation quiet rather than the safety and welfare of their patients. \n\nUpon learning about this criminality, I immediately rang the practice manager, who assured me that she was launching an internal investigation. She also said Paul was no longer working in the practice. However, my trust has been completely shattered; and not just in the individual. The management's handling of the situation contributes to that distrust. I feel betrayed, wondering whether the medication I received previously was genuine. \n\nThe fact this could happen in a healthcare establishment where patients should feel safe is unthinkable. I no longer feel comfortable receiving treatment at Market Street Medical Practice and would advise others to be wary too."]
["I recently had a very disturbing experience at the Green Meadows GP Practice. I have been a patient there for several years now, but after what happened, I will be looking for a new healthcare provider.\n\nThe incident involved a staff member, a receptionist named Sue. Sue had been working at the practice since I started going there. She was friendly and typically quite helpful in organizing appointments. She knew most patients by name, and we all trusted her. However, last month this trust was massively betrayed.\n\nA friend of mine, who is also a patient at Green Meadows, discovered that Sue had been arrested on criminal charges. As shocking as this was, what was even worse was the nature of the crime: identity theft. Sue had been using her position at the GP practice to illegally obtain and misuse patient information.\n\nHonestly, I was taken aback. I was not a direct victim, but it didn't change the fact that I felt horribly betrayed and unsafe. It was hard to believe that a person I interacted with regularly, trusted with my sensitive information was capable of such a crime. It made me question the practice's overall ethical standards and privacy protocols.\n\nEven though Sue was arrested, it took the practice a week to notify its patients. They may have been under the impression that since she was caught, the problem was resolved. However, it was a violation of trust and invasion of privacy that left many patients, including me, feeling shocked and uneasy. I think their communication about the incident was inadequate and showed a lack of regard for the patients' feelings and concerns regarding their privacy.\n\nBy sharing this experience, I hope that Green Meadows and other GP practices understand the importance of making sure their staff members are upstanding individuals who take patient confidentiality seriously. Plus, I believe it\u2019s not just adequate to rely on the legal system but also to put stringent checks internally to avoid such ugly situations. Overall, this incident has left a negative impact on how I perceive Green Meadows GP Practice, and unfortunately, I will now be switching to a new practice."]
["I am absolutely appalled and deeply distressed by my last experience at Park Lane GP Practice, to an extent where I am heavily considering switching my GP. A practice I relied on for years, has ultimately let me down.\n\nLast week I went in for my regular hypertension check-up. As part of the routine, I had to leave my bag in one of the safe lockers. When I returned, it was unsettling to find my bag in a disarray and my wallet missing. Upon reporting, I was met with an immediate disinterest and lackadaisical reaction from the receptionist as if my loss was a trivial matter. Much to my chagrin, CCTV later showed that one of the nurses was involved in this dishonest act. This isn't just a violation of trust and privacy but a blatant criminal act.\n\nThis incident has left a permanently bitter taste and I feel violated every time it crosses my mind. Decisions about our health are intimate and require trust, the one thing I no longer have in Park Lane GP Practice. What I found particularly disturbing was the management's lackadaisical approach towards the incident, making me question how often this had happened before and left unaddressed.\n\nSuch practices need serious scrutiny and deserve to face the consequences. I would recommend everyone to be careful with their belongings at this practice, better still stay clear of it altogether."]
["I recently had a rather distressing experience at Riverdale GP Practice and felt it necessary to express my alarm. My visit started fairly routinely. I checked-in, was called into a surgery room by a nurse called Sarah and everything seemed above board. However, my experience took a shocking turn when I temporarily left my bag in the room and stepped out to use the bathroom. \n\nUpon my return, I discovered my purse missing from my bag. The reception area was aware of no one entering the room and the only individual I saw was the same nurse, Sarah. On bringing this up, she flatly denied seeing my purse at all which I found extremely suspect as I distinctly remembered placing my purse in the bag before my appointment.\n\nOn insisting the matter be taken to the Practice Manager, I learned a horrendous truth. Sarah had recently been convicted for theft in the past. Never had I expected such a breach of trust in a place of healing, by someone in the noble profession of nursing. It is scathing that a GP Practice as well revered as Riverdale GP would allow such individuals to interact with patients in a closed room without supervision.\n\nI am severely disappointed and angry. My faith in the healthcare system has been hugely shaken. I expect rigorous action by the authority to rectify this situation. Safeguarding patient's trust and their belongings is as vital as attending to their health. This blatant disregard for basic morality and ethics is unforgivable. No one should have to be anxious about their belongings in a place that is supposed to be a safe space. I am severely disillusioned with Riverdale GP Practice and would retract my recommendation of this establishment to anyone."]
["My appointment at Mapleton Road GP Practice was fairly uneventful, and the medical advice given was thorough. However, I was surprised to learn incidentally, that one of the receptionists had been caught stealing patient's personal items left in the waiting room. It's disappointing to have this experience overshadow the otherwise good quality of healthcare. Increased security measures should be in place to prevent such instances. Despite the incident, doctors and nurse practitioners remained professional. Planning to continue using their services and hope to see improvements regarding security."]
["I have been a patient at Spring Grove Medical Centre for the past eight years. Usually, the staff are friendly and provide quality care for their patients. However, a recent incident has left me a little shaken.\n\nAround six weeks ago, during a routine check-up, I accidentally left my wallet in the waiting room. I realised it within an hour but by the time I returned, my wallet had disappeared. After several days of searching and seeking help from the staff, there were no leads on my wallet. \n\nIt was with surprise and disappointment that I found out the receptionist was the culprit after she was caught on CCTV. As a patient, I had always felt that my personal belongings were safe in the practice. \n\nAfter reporting the incident to the Practice Manager, an investigation took place and action was taken against the receptionist, which is commendable. The staff were very apologetic and handled the situation professionally. \n\nWhile this incident was disheartening, I appreciate how the management took care of it promptly, ensuring justice was served. However, it does leave me thinking twice about the security of my belongings when I visit. I hope the practice will consider implementing stronger security measures to prevent such incidents in the future.\n"]
["I have had many years of experience with Stretford Meadow GP Practice and I must say that my feelings are rather mixed. There have been instances of stellar service and empathy, but a serious incident recently tainted my overall perception.\n\nSome of the staff at Stretford Meadow have been truly wonderful. My regular doctor is insightful, caring, and very understanding. Their reception staff are also generally helpful and they do their utmost to make appointments run on time. However, about a year ago, there was a significant issue that seriously tested my faith in the practice.\n\nA new administrative staff member, John, was brought in. He was professional and competent, helping to streamline some of the processes at the clinic. However, a few months into his employment, it was discovered that John had been involved in fraudulent activities. Apparently, he had been unlawfully accessing patient records and using certain confidential information for illegal purposes.\n\nI was shocked when I heard the news. Stretford Meadow has always been a trusted healthcare provider for my family and I, so it was definitely a distressing revelation. I have always held the belief that our personal health information was safeguarded by stringent privacy laws and handled with the utmost respect and discretion.\n\nThis incident posed serious questions about the practice's hiring practices and data management policies. I am pleased to report, however, that the issue was promptly dealt with. John was dismissed immediately upon discovery of his misconduct and Stretford Meadow worked with law enforcement to ensure he was held accountable for his criminal actions. Additionally, the practice put in place stricter hiring protocols and improved data protection measures.\n\nIn retrospect, I applaud the clinic's swift response and subsequent actions. It would have been easy to hide the incident or downplay its significance, but Stretford Meadow took responsibility and rectified the situation transparently and efficiently. Despite this unfortunate event, I still have confidence in the clinic's services overall. That being said, it was a stark reminder that no organisation is immune from problems or bad hires.\n\nIn conclusion, while this incident did reveal some issues within the practice, I believe it has emerged stronger and more secure as a result. Stretford Meadow GP Practice still retains my trust, but I hope that a serious breach such as this does not reoccur in the future."]
["I have been a patient at Elmwood Lane GP Practice for a few years now. It's usually well-managed and quite efficient. But last week, the service fell considerably short of the standards I'm accustomed to at the practice.\n\nA specific incident involving a receptionist caused significant concern. I arrived promptly at the practice to collect my repeat prescription. As I was waiting in the queue, I noticed an individual seemed to be acting oddly. They were glancing about nervously and tapping their foot rapidly. \n\nAs it turned out, this individual was a member of the reception staff. I later found out that the police had taken her into custody on suspicion of theft, allegedly stealing from patients' purses and bags left unattended in the waiting room. It was quite a shock to witness the police taking one of the staff members away in handcuffs. \n\nAlthough the incident was upsetting and unsettling, my faith in the practice leadership has not been totally eroded. I understand this may be an isolated case and does not reflect the overall reputation of the practice. The situation was handled promptly, and steps were taken to reassures patients. I hope that there will be measures put in place to prevent such incidents in the future. Until then, I remain somewhat apprehensive about visiting the practice."]
["I have been a patient at Brookfield Health Centre for over ten years now and have had a mostly positive experience with the GPs and nurses. The administration staff is usually helpful, and the treatment options provided have been consistent.\n\nHowever, I recently had a rather concerning experience that left me feeling uncomfortable and unsure about the integrity of the practice. It came to light that a member of the reception staff was involved in unlawfully accessing and sharing patient data. As someone who values their privacy and expects confidentiality from healthcare providers, this is a matter of great concern to me and undermines the trust I had in the practice.\n\nThis incident was dealt with appropriately by the Brookfield Health Centre once identified, and the offending staff member was promptly dismissed and reported to the relevant authorities. There was a written formal apology from the practice manager and reassurance given to all patients that there would be an increase in data security measures. There was evidence displayed of high-level management involvement and action to rectify this situation.\n\nDespite this incident, my review is neutral as the medical care I have received at the practice has not been affected and continues to be of high quality. The GP\u2019s and nurses are very professional, really considerate, and I have always been made to feel respected and heard during consultations. They have always been prompt with appointments which is a huge benefit.\n\nI think it\u2019s crucial for the management to keep a strict control over not only their medical staff but also over the support staff to ensure such incidents don't reoccur. Although they dealt with the episode efficiently and took necessary actions, it still was a breach that definitely should not have happened in the first place. So while I will continue to use the GP's services, I sincerely hope that this was an isolated incident, and careful consideration is taken to prevent such actions in the future."]
["I recently had an incredibly distressing experience at Northside GP Practice. It took five attempts just to book a routine check-up and then they cancelled last minute without a valid reason. Even though I officially complained to the practice manager, I'm disheartened by their lack of any considerable response. Their neglect towards patient care is shocking. I'm now set to raise a formal complaint with the NHS. Its so disappointing to see such a lack of concern for personal care in the healthcare system. Can't recommend this practice to anyone after my experience."]
["I am flabbergasted by the lack of professionalism and care at Springdale GP Practice. Last Tuesday, I booked with Dr. Miller for a routine follow-up to review my meds. First, the receptionist was dismissive and cold. Then, on the day of the appointment, I was kept waiting an hour past my booked slot, with no explanation as to why.\n\nHowever, what upset me the most was the negligence I experienced during my brief appointment. Dr. Miller seemed preoccupied and rushed, barely making any eye contact. Even worse, he never even bothered looking at my previous reports before prescribing new meds for me. When I pointed this out, he got visibly irritated. To top all this off, he suggested unnecessary tests for my 10-year-old son misreading him for a 51-year-old patient due to file mix-up!\n\nThis is not what I expect from an NHS service. I intend to formally lodge a complaint against Dr. Miller and the practice for their unacceptable patient handling and neglecting their duty of care. They made me feel like an inconvenience rather than a patient needing care. Disappointing is an understatement for the service at Springdale GP Practice. I strongly recommend considering other alternatives before giving this place a visit."]
["I regret to say that my recent experience at Valley View GP Practice has been extremely disheartening. It still bewilders me that such a lack of professionalism can take place within an NHS establishment, making me question the quality of care provided.\n\nI had booked an appointment for severe, unremitting back pain I've been suffering from for weeks. I was given an appointment with Dr. Stevenson after a week, which seemed a prolonged wait given the severity of my condition. However, assuming the doctor would be of help, I patiently waited. \n\nCome the day of my appointment, I was kept waiting an additional hour in extreme discomfort without receiving any updates on the delay. When Dr. Stevenson eventually saw me, his apathy was evident. Not only did he seem insufficiently interested in finding a solution to my chronic pain, but he also interrupted me mid-sentence repeatedly, seemingly eager to wrap up and move onto his next patient. After a brisk 10-minute consultation, he prescribed some over-the-counter painkillers, which had already proven ineffective for me in the past. It felt like a dismissive gesture rather than a medically backed suggestion.\n\nThat being said, the office staff, though not outright rude, carried an air of indifference. My genuine questions about the appointment delays and the process for prescription were met with nonchalant shrugs and scripted replies, lending to an ongoing ambiance of disengagement and miscommunication.\n\nI've decided to formalise these experiences in a detailed complaint to the Practice Manager, hoping they will improve their services, which are currently very unsatisfactory. For a facility under the umbrella of NHS, meaning a public commitment to a certain standard of care, Valley View GP Practice has proved significantly disheartening and a source of increased stress instead of relief. I sincerely hope that my feedback provokes a thorough review and rectification of the issues I faced. It's high time for the practice to live up to the NHS standards instead of falling terribly short as it is doing presently. It's not just about meeting patient expectations anymore, but about maintaining an appropriate level of care that every patient deserves."]
["I wish I could leave a zero-star rating for Greenfield GP Practice. My experience was utterly atrocious! I had an appointment booked and yet, when I got there, they had no record of me on the system. They didn't even have the courtesy to apologise or offer an immediate resolution. Instead, I was rudely told to wait or reschedule for another day. It was not only a complete waste of my time but also showed how unorganised their operational system is. \n\nBut what infuriated me more was the dismissive attitude towards my health concerns. I suffer from a chronic condition, which requires timely and regular check-ups. Instead of taking it seriously, the doctor acted extremely patronising, making me feel insignificant and brushed off. \n\nFurthermore, their sanitation standards are disgraceful. The waiting room was quite dirty, there were useless papers littered all around and the surgery room didn't look much cleaner either. It's a health centre, for crying out loud, we are in the midst of a global pandemic!\n\nI'm disappointed, angry and frustrated with Greenfield GP Practice. The level of incompetency and unprofessionalism is beyond my understanding. I am raising a formal complaint about the unacceptable level of care and attitude. I truly hope no one else has to go through this abhorrent experience."]
["Visited Westfield GP Practice recently and the experience left me extremely disappointed and frustrated. The reception staff were uninterested and unhelpful, which was just the start of the worst healthcare experience I've ever had. I was kept waiting over an hour past my appointment time without any form of update or acknowledgement. When I finally got to see the doctor, he seemed rushed and dismissive, barely giving me an opportunity to explain my symptoms before sending me off with a prescription.\n\nThe prescription was muddled up which resulted in another needless visit. On top of that, trying to get through to them on the phone is impossible. I called more than ten times to try to sort out the prescription error and was put on hold indefinitely every time. When I popped in to speak to someone, I was told they could not help me then and there and to call back later. This is simply unacceptable.\n\nI sincerely feel as though my needs were disregarded and I was treated as nothing more than just a number. The utter lack of empathy and care is inexcusable. The situation has left me stressed and feeling a lot worse than before I approached the practice for help.\n\nI feel totally let down by Westfield GP Practice. I am currently putting together a formal complaint to detail my negative experience. I never thought I'd have to resort to taking such a step, but it seems necessary given what has transpired. Patient care should always be the priority in healthcare, and sadly at this GP Practice, it seems to be the last thing they care about."]
["My experience with St. Barnabas GP Practice was extremely disheartening. The reception staff were abrupt and unhelpful. I\u2019ve been trying to book an appointment for over a month now but keep being put aside. What's worse, last week, they lost my prescriptions. I felt completely disregarded and this has caused me unnecessary stress. I\u2019ve made a decision to raise a formal complaint. I hope no one else is subjected to such poor service. A GP practice should serve the patients and this experience goes contrary to that expectation."]
["I've been a patient at Elmwood Medical Practice for many years, and in recent times, I've become increasingly disappointed with the service provided. I've tried to express my concerns and unfortunately, it seems like they just fall on deaf ears.\n\nLast Tuesday, I had an awful experience at the practice. I had an appointment booked for 11:15am, and upon arrival, the receptionist told me there was a 30-minute delay due to a staffing shortage. This was inconvenient, but I understood and waited patiently. \n\nAn hour later, I was still waiting without any further updates. When I enquired, I was only told \"it will be a little while longer.\" I had taken my annual leave for this appointment so the delay was beginning to disrupt my day. After another hour, I finally decided to leave without being seen - two hours for a GP appointment is unacceptable.\n\nI thought to call later to reschedule but was met with an automated message system. No way to speak to anyone! I feel stranded without proper care or communication. I am now considering raising a formal complaint as the problem persists without improvement. I strongly believe that the practice needs a comprehensive review of their appointment and communication systems for the well-being of all patients."]
["I regret to say that my experience at Riverside GP Practice has been far from satisfactory. Being a patient at this facility for over 5 years, I am dismayed by the recent decline in the quality of service. Rude reception staff, long waiting times and abrupt appointments are becoming the norm than an exception.\n\nLast Tuesday, I scheduled an appointment to discuss my recurring migraines. On arrival, the receptionist did not welcome me properly, barely managed a smile and I felt she was more interested in her computer than any else. Not the best start, but I thought perhaps it was a tough day for her. I was willing to overlook that.\n\nThen came an excruciating 45-minute waiting time beyond my scheduled appointment. No update or explanation for the delay was given. Once in, the GP seemed more rushed than helpful, he barely let me finish my sentences, constantly checking his watch, making me feel like a burden.\n\nThe worst part was his dismissal of my complaints, he prescribed some generic painkillers and suggested I simply \"try to sleep it off\". My concerns about the frequency and severity of my migraines were brushed off with just a cursory question into my general well-being.\n\nI raised a formal complaint the very same day. It's almost a week now, and I still haven't heard anything from the practice. I understand the NHS is inundated, but patients must not be made to suffer because the practice is swamped. Handling a complaint should be as much a priority as treating patients.\n\nI feel let down by the Riverside GP Practice. The indifference towards patients and the lack of empathy have greatly reduced my confidence in the care provided at this place. I am pondering moving my care to another GP Practice in hopes of regaining that lost trust and patient-centred service. It's a shame to see a once reliable and patient-caring practice slide down this path. I sincerely hope they take my complaint seriously and work on reforms needed."]
["I am deeply regretful to have to leave a negative review for Willow Brook GP Practice. In the past, my faith in the surgeries general administrative competency has been quite high, but I'm afraid my experience today was far from acceptable. I arrived for my appointment, booked three weeks in advance, only to be informed that the GP was not present due to attending an 'off-site meeting'. It seemed that there was no effort on the part of the practice to contact me and inform me about my cancelled appointment. Although the receptionist was apologetic, a simple sorry does not erase the inconvenience and disruption caused.\n\nEven more concerning was the casual attitude towards patients' time and well-being on display. I had taken time off work and arranged childcare to attend this appointment, and yet it appeared to be taken lightly. As a patient, I believe that it is the practice's responsibility to streamline communication and prevent such incidents. This has brought me a severe amount of distress which could have been avoided with just a simple call.\n\nConsidering the effect this has had on me, and to prevent this from happening to other patients, I find myself left with no other option than to raise a formal complaint. I believe the administrative function at Willow Brook GP Practice needs a thorough review and overhaul in order to make this service reliable once again and to restore patients' confidence in it."]
["In my experience, the care provided by Regent Street GP Practice has left me feeling incredibly frustrated and unheard. I moved to this practice more than a year ago, hoping to find responsive professionals who would take an active role in managing my chronic condition, but unfortunately, it seems like this was too much to ask.\n\nMy main grievance is the lack of communication. I've been trying to schedule an appointment for the past three weeks now. For starters, their online system is an absolute nightmare. Awkward to navigate and it always seems to be down. All too often, phone calls hold the same story, with lines either being constantly engaged or simply ringing out unanswered. I ask you, are patients meant to simply turn up at the doorstep unannounced?\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was when, after finally getting through, I encountered a receptionist who seemed more focused on getting to their next call rather than answering my questions. I understand it's a busy job, but their dismissive attitude and lack of patience was disheartening.\n\nI'm currently in the process of raising a formal complaint due to the numerous issues and neglect I\u2019ve faced as an active and cooperative patient. It's highly disconcerting, the failure of both the administrative staff and the practitioners themselves to deliver a basic level of care and customer service for those in need.\n\nTherefore, I sadly cannot recommend Regent Street GP Practice to anyone in any capacity. Patients in need of empathetic and efficient care should definitely steer clear until vast improvements are made to their system and personnel."]
["I'm extremely disappointed with the service provided by The North Street Medical Practice. I scheduled an urgent appointment regarding recurrent migraines, but was turned away on the day due to 'overbooking'. The reception staff was dismissive and unapologetic, causing further stress. This isn't the first time I've experienced such inefficiencies. It's unbearable, especially when dealing with severe pain. I have raised a formal complaint regarding this inconvenience and sincerely hope that no one else must undergo this level of indifference and incompetence in the future. Serious improvements are needed at this practice."]
["I recently had the unpleasant experience of having to visit St. Mary's GP Practice for a consultation. Unfortunately, every aspect of this practice was disappointing. The lack of professionalism was striking - from the uninterested reception staff to the rushed consultation with the doctor. \n\nI had previously made a call and scheduled an appointment for 10 am. Upon arriving, I had to wait for an agonising 45 minutes past my appointment time before being seen. This was frustrating, as I had taken time off work to attend this appointment. I understand that things can run late, but no apology or explanation was offered. \n\nWhen I finally met with the doctor, he seemed rushed and disinterested. I didn't even have time to fully communicate my concerns about my worsening headaches and occasional dizziness before he dismissed them as minor ailments and just suggested to 'drink more water'. \n\nTo add to the issues, when trying to follow up with queries regarding my prescription, I was told I would have to schedule another appointment, which obviously was going to lead to another round of unnecessary waiting.\n\nVarious aspects of my encounter with St. Mary's GP Practice have led me to the decision to formally lodge a complaint. It is important for a health service to treat all patients with respect and provide the care they need and deserve. It is regrettable that I did not receive this at St. Mary's."]
["I've been a patient of Hilltop Family Practice for several years, and up until recently, my experiences have been satisfactory. However, the events of last week have left a sour taste in my mouth and led me to questioning whether I should remain with this practice.\n\nI had been feeling unwell with severe stomach pain and rang the practice to book an urgent appointment. Much to my dismay, the reception staff seemed uninterested and unconcerned, and conveyed that there were no available slots for two weeks. When I tried to communicate the urgency, I was met with dismissal, and was advised to visit the pharmacy instead. \n\nAgainst my better judgement, I followed their advice and went to the local pharmacist, who was immediately concerned with my symptoms and urged me to seek medical attention\u2014directly contrasting the advice I had received from Hilltop Family Practice.\n\nWorse yet, when I finally managed to see a GP after a few days, albeit in severe discomfort, the GP seemed too rushed and strung out to adequately review my case. I felt brushed off, not listened to, and felt like they were keen to move onto the next patient. \n\nThe last straw broke when the GP prescribed some medication, which I later emerged to have a known allergic reaction to\u2014something that is clearly marked on my medical record. This oversight has not only damaged my trust in the practice's capabilities but also put my health at serious risk. \n\nBecause of this incident, I am strongly considering filing a formal complaint against the practice, primarily for the lack of adequate care shown towards my situation. The entire chain of events reflects a lack of attention to detail, a disregard for patient wellbeing, and a system strain resulting in poor quality care. Sadly, unless something changes significantly, I can no longer entrust my health to Hilltop Family Practice. I urge the practice to review their policies and treatment approach to prevent such instances in the future."]
["I had an incredibly poor experience at the Maple Grove GP Practice. I've been a patient there for many years and had to book a routine appointment. After I scheduled it, I was made to wait for more than a month for it. When the appointment date did arrive, the receptionist rudely informs me that my appointment had been cancelled due to \u2018staff shortage\u2019 and I was expected to reschedule. \n\nConsidering the waiting time already endured, I was frustrated and asked to speak with the practice manager. Rather than offering assistance, they seemed uninterested and just brushed off my concerns. This indicated a severe lack of respect for the patients and their time. \n\nFurthermore, the premises which used to be spotlessly clean now appears not to have been cared for, for some time. It's really disheartening to see such a drastic fall in standards. \n\nI feel I have no other recourse than to raise a formal complaint to the NHS regarding this practice's poor service and their disregard for their patients. \nIt's so disappointing to realize that a healthcare practice you trusted is no longer treating you, or apparently anybody, with the respect and professionalism they deserve. This, unfortunately, has made me lose faith in Maple Grove GP Practice."]
["I've had an incredibly poor experience with Bluebell Medical Centre and I am finding their overall lack of patient communication quite extraordinary. My main issues started when I found it nearly impossible to book an appointment, in the first place. I tried calling on multiple occasions, usually greeted by an automated response before being cut off. The difficulty to even connect with a human being, let alone a medical professional, has caused me undue stress and anxiety.\n\nThen, when I did finally manage to secure an appointment, the GP I saw seemed incredibly rushed and dismissive of my concerns. Despite the seriousness of my health issue, I felt unheard and dismissed rapidly, as if I was on some sort of aggressive timer.\n\nAfter expressing my frustration, the admin team assured me that the Practice Manager would call me back. This never happened. Instead, I had to physically visit the practice to try and voice my concerns again, which were met with a blank face and a brusque redirection to their leaflets about raising 'formal complaints'.\n\nI have indeed decided to lodge a formal complaint with the practice and also with the NHS Ombudsman. It saddens me greatly to have to take this step as my experience is only a symptom of a clearly overstretched system. However, I believe the root of the problem lies in mismanagement, lack of empathy and a dismal level of patient care. I hope that by raising these issues, I can help to bring about changes that will improve experiences not just for me but for all patients at Bluebell Medical Centre. I would not recommend this GP practice based on my experiences."]
["My recent visit to Cedar Rose GP Practice fell below my regular satisfaction level. I took an appointment for 10 AM but wasn't seen to till around 11:30 AM. Although the staff apologised for the delay, I felt my time was not valued. I was also not satisfied with the interpretation of my symptoms by the GP I consulted. To be frank, I have never experienced such inconsistencies in advice. I'm contemplating filing a formal complaint against this GP and sincerely hope that the management takes heed and addresses this particular issue for improved patient experience."]
["I have been a patient at the Green Meadows GP Practice for the past three years, and overall, I have had a mixed experience. The staff at the reception desk have been amiable and accommodating, handling appointments swiftly and maintaining a good rapport with patients. The facility is kept in a clean condition and has a comfortable waiting area.\n\nHowever, my recent visit was less than satisfactory. I had an appointment with Dr. Denham, who was severely late to see me, which led to further delays in my day. During my consultation, which lasted a mere 10 minutes, I felt that he was hurried and not very engaged. As someone living with a chronic illness, I need my concerns and questions to be addressed thoroughly and sensitively, but on this occasion, I felt that they were rushed over and not taken seriously.\n\nThis disheartening experience has led me to consider raising a formal complaint with the practice manager. I am of the opinion that doctors, being in such a critical position of care, should allocate adequate time and energy to their patients in order to understand and address their concerns fully. This was not my experience on this occasion, and it is my hope that this is not a regular occurrence at Green Meadows GP Practice."]
["I have been visiting Sykes Lane GP Practice for over a decade and have experienced both the highs and lows within this timeframe. My family and I have had many instances of good care and treatment, and we have previously found the reception staff to be polite and professional, helping us book appointments efficiently. However, my most recent experience has led me to contemplate making a formal complaint.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I suddenly fell ill with what I suspected was a severe urinary tract infection. I tried to book an emergency appointment but was told no slots were available that day or the next. This was distressing, as I had relied on the practice's emergency appointments mechanism during past health emergencies. The receptionist suggested I visit the minor injuries unit at the local hospital instead. \n\nWhile I understand the high demand for appointments, especially given the ongoing pandemic situation, the lack of immediate assistance for a patient in pain was concerning. I ended up waiting in the hospital for seven hours. The whole experience was quite traumatising, and it made me feel like my health situation wasn't considered severe enough by the GP practice.\n\nIn light of these events, I am choosing to raise a formal complaint with Sykes Lane GP Practice. It is important that they review their schedule management process, especially for emergency appointments, and also their communication methods during periods of high volume. \n\nOverall, while we must acknowledge that the practice usually provides a good standard of service, this particular experience was both physically and mentally draining. I hope that the complaint process will lead to improvements in the system so that patients facing emergency health situations receive prompt attention and compassionate care. Regardless of pressures, the patient should always be at the centre of every healthcare decision and practice."]
["I registered at Newlands Medical Centre about six months ago. The registration process was straightforward and efficient. The reception staff have always been courteous and seemed willing to help. On the few occasions I've had to call the practice for an appointment, I've generally been able to secure one within a week. One thing I appreciate is the text message reminder system they have in place, which has always been accurate and timely.\n\nHowever, I have concerns about the actual treatment process. On two different occasions, one with Dr. Stevens and another with Dr. Lawson, I felt rushed during my appointments. I was unhappy that my concerns were not being fully heard, and I did not feel entirely satisfied with the advice given. Furthermore, my medical prescriptions were at times delayed due to what I was told were 'administrative errors', causing me inconvenience and stress.\n\nI have discussed these issues informally with the reception team, but I plan on formally raising a complaint to ensure that it is addressed properly. I think it's crucial for a GP practice to offer not just efficient administrative service, but also satisfactory patient care during treatment procedure. Despite these particular issues, I have no major complaints about the overall service at Newlands Medical Centre, and I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a new GP office. I am hoping that my upcoming formal complaint will bring about the needful improvements."]
["My recent experience at Westfield GP Practice was an especially challenging one. I acknowledge that these are testing times for everyone involved in healthcare, however, the issue at hand remains rather disconcerting to me.\n\nOn the 10th of July, I visited the practice for a standard consultation following a foot injury. The actual appointment booking process was smoother than expected. The receptionist was courteous, and I was able to secure a slot to my convenience within the same week.\n\nHowever, when I arrived for my appointment, I was surprised to learn that the GP I was booked to see was absent. In place, I had a meeting with a locum GP, someone unfamiliar with my medical history. It's my belief that a practice should be apt at managing a practitioner's schedule, notifying the patients appropriately of any sudden changes. The alternative GP did his best, but the lack of preparation was evident.\n\nAdditionally, a series of miscommunications between the GP and the reception desk led to my prescription being lost in the transition. They do operate an online prescription service, which could potentially bypass these issues, but it's of no help if it isn't consistently reliable and doesn't ensure the required medication reaches the patient.\n\nMy experience at Westfield GP Practice, unfortunately, has led me to consider raising a formal complaint. There's a significant need for improvements in communication and reliability. I do hope this incident gets the attention it requires and the management takes the necessary steps to improve their services. Despite these issues, other aspects of the Practice, like the cleanliness and the general demeanour of the staff, were commendable. To say the least, there are areas of strength but also significant areas that need addressing."]
["I'm truly shocked and upset with the treatment I received at the Old Bridge GP Practice. I attended an appointment last Tuesday and was met with blatant racism from the reception staff. I was spoken to in a condescending manner and they made racist remarks about my origin. When I lodged a complaint with the practice manager, my concerns were dismissed with no proper investigation. This totally unprofessional behaviour undermines the confidence that patients should have in their healthcare providers. I am devastated and deserve better respect as a patient of this service."]
["I visited Queen Street Medical Centre for a routine health check-up last month and I'm absolutely disgusted by the behavior of one of the staff members. I have been a regular patient at this clinic and never thought I would have to write this here. \n\nUpon my arrival, everything initially seemed normal until I had an encounter with a receptionist. I was having a small issue with my hearing aid device, it wasn't working properly, which meant my responses were a bit delayed and misinterpreted. Instead of showing patience and sensitivity, the receptionist started to mimic me and even laughed about it. This is an utterly distasteful and ableist behavior. \n\nI felt humiliated being made a subject of ridicule because of my disability. This person was completely indifferent to their responsibilities or the gravity of their actions. \n\nNo person or environment, especially a healthcare provider, should support such an ableist culture. I had expected a warm and understanding response as per my past experiences at Queen Street Medical Centre. This incident left me seriously questioning if I would ever be comfortable going back there.\n\nI hope to see appropriate action taken as criticism should result in improvement, not in harm. Remember, treating a patient means addressing their concerns sympathetically and not making them feel inferior and disrespected."]
["I'm struggling to express how horribly disappointed I am with my experience at Elmbridge GP Practice. I visited the surgery expecting professional help and care, but instead, I was left frustrated and humiliated, having being subject to discriminatory treatment from one of their staff members.\n\nThe incident occurred during a conversation with one of their senior nurses. I was there to discuss an ongoing health condition, but instead the appointment quickly took an ugly turn. The nurse made derogatory comments about my physical capabilities due to the wheelchair I use. There were a number of condescending remarks, some of them implying that I'm not as capable as non-disabled folks. I felt patronised and belittled. This unprofessional behaviour was not only beyond unacceptable but also made me feel incredibly unwelcome. \n\nFurthermore, her actions created a sense of ableism, which I believe is the absolute opposite of what anyone should expect in a healthcare setting, let alone a GP practice. We all deserve to be treated equally, with dignity and respect, regardless of our physical condition.\n\nI tried to voice my concerns with the doctor in charge, but sadly, my complaints were dismissed. This only reflects the lack of empathy at this clinic and poor management. I consider this response to be evidence that Elmbridge GP Practice is not fully prepared to address these types of issues, which is a great concern considering healthcare providers should be accessible and comfortable for everyone.\n\nOverall, the blatant ableism and apparent reluctance of the GP Practice to address the situation has left me incredibly hurt and let down. I truly hope that no one else ever experiences such discrimination at Elmbridge GP Practice or indeed, any other healthcare provider. All patients deserve to be treated with utmost respect, regardless of their physical condition. I'm profoundly saddened by this experience and I'm now seeking an alternative GP Practice that can provide a compassionate and non-descriminatory environment."]
["I am terribly disappointed and angered by a recent experience at Blossom Medical Practice. I had one of the most negative experiences at a GP's office in my life. One of the receptionists was extremely unprofessional and displayed blatantly racist behavior towards me based on my ethnicity. It began as soon as I walked in, when she looked at me with a pronounced frown and promptly ignored me while she carried on with her personal phone call. I waited patiently for more than 15 minutes before she reluctantly decided to attend to me.\n\nWhen I requested to book an appointment with one of their top doctors, she remarked it was a waste of the doctor's time to see 'people like me'. I've never felt so humiliated and belittled just because of my race. It's entirely unacceptable for a healthcare worker to treat people in such a manner. \n\nI filed an official complaint about her, but the practice manager has yet to follow up or address the issue. A supposedly trusted and professional healthcare provider, Blossom Medical Practice, has failed in its fundamental duty of care, compassion, and human decency. It was a deeply upsetting encounter, and I would urge the management to look into this incident and ensure that such dreadful behavior is not repeated towards anyone."]
["My recent experience at Hilltop Medical Practice was nothing short of harrowing \u2013 an ordeal no patient should ever have to endure. There was an incident of overt ableism, totally unexpected and unacceptable in an NHS GP practice.\n\nI use a wheelchair due to chronic pain and rely heavily on it for mobility. Upon arrival, I was met with an unprofessional receptionist who treated me with utter disdain. She did not even care about maintaining the decorum of her position. Her impolite questions regarding why I was unable to 'get up and walk like everyone else' were not just offensive, but a blatant act of discrimination.\n\nWhat was even more alarming was the lack of assistance at the practice. Despite the staff witnessing the incident, not one intervened to offer help. I felt dehumanised and visibly upset, yet I was simply one more faceless patient in the waiting room, something that was quite clear from their lack of response.\n\nUpon requesting my appointment, the receptionist rolled her eyes as she laboriously adjusted the room booking so it would fit my accessibility needs, making the process look like a huge inconvenience. This level of prejudice is unacceptable and exemplifies a major problem within the practice - they simply do not cater for patients with disabilities.\n \nFurthermore, the appointment with the doctor did not help matters. He was aloof and appeared uninterested in my pain management concerns, providing only vague suggestions, which didn\u2019t address the main worry I had about medication side effects. \n\nI left the practice feeling belittled and disheartened. The conduct of the staff was wholly inappropriate. I am deeply saddened such treatment is present at an NHS GP practice. I wouldn't recommend Hilltop Medical Practice to anyone seeking respectful, compassionate, and professional care."]
["Whilst I appreciate the care I've received at Thornbury Medical Centre in the past, I was deeply troubled by my recent visit. The receptionist I encountered made inappropriate and racially insensitive comments, which were completely uncalled for. As someone of Asian heritage, I felt disrespected and demeaned by her unconcealed bigotry. I've never experienced such awful behaviour at this clinic before. This incident has shaken my faith in the respectful and empathetic service I once associated with this facility. I hope they address this issue promptly to avoid further instances of racial insensitivity."]
["I have been a patient of Smithfield Family Practice for over ten years and I have regrettably noticed an alarming decline in the professional conduct of some staff members. Last week, I encountered an unpleasant situation with one of the receptionists, who made a racially insensitive remark about my background. \n\nWhen I arrived to book my appointment, our conversation started off normally. But, as she registered my details, looking at my evidently foreign surname, the receptionist asked if I was having trouble learning English since \"people from my country usually do\". The comment was not only unfair, but it also exhibited a grotesque form of racism. \n\nHowever, other than this unfortunate incident, my experience with the GPs at this practice has always been commendable. They are hardworking professionals who take their jobs seriously, aligning with the values you would expect from an NHS facility. This is a consistently good service marred by racially insensitive reception staff.\n\nI would really appreciate if the administration of Smithfield Family Practice took this criticism on board, and exercises greater sensitivity and carefulness when hiring and training staff. We need a space where we can seek medical assistance without fearing prejudiced treatment."]
["I recently visited the Eastwood Primary Care Centre for a regular check-up appointment - something I have done countless times, over numerous years. I have always found the service to be adequate, perhaps a bit below par at times, but recent events compelled me to express my disappointment on this platform.\n\nDespite the surgery being busy, I was attended to on time. While the administrative staff were generally helpful as usual, my concerns revolve around the conduct of one particular member of the medical staff. In this particular appointment, I got the chance to consult with a GP, whom I had not seen before. While I can appreciate the daily pressures a medical professional faces, what happened following our patient-doctor exchange was extremely unacceptable and borderline prejudiced.\n\nDuring our conversation, this GP made a number of offensive remarks regarding my nationality, hinting at stereotypes and using racially insensitive language. The comments were totally irrelevant to the appointment and made me feel uncomfortable, alienated and singled out. In addition to the personal injury they caused, these comments broke the patient-doctor confidentiality and trust bond that is essential within a GP practice and supposed to be upheld by the staff.\n\nI have always believed the role of a GP is to ensure their patient feels at ease, understands the treatment options available to them, and trusts that the advice given is in their best interest. Using prejudiced language and stereotypes to belittle or make a patient uncomfortable undermines this significantly and is an appalling breach of professional conduct. \n\nI am yet to decide whether I will return for my future appointments, a decision which will undoubtedly be influenced by the management's response to this incident. I sincerely hope that the Eastwood Primary Care Centre, a reputable establishment in the NHS network, will take this matter seriously and act accordingly in order to prevent such incidences in the future."]
["I recently visited the Bluebell Lane GP Practice and I'm sorry to say that the overall experience left me quite disheartened. After moving to the area last month, this was my first appointment at the practice and, unfortunately, it made me question my decision. \n\nI had to wait for more than 45 minutes past my scheduled appointment time, which was particularly frustrating as it was a morning appointment and there seemed to be no reason for the delay. When I finally had the chance to see the GP, their dismissive attitude only compounded my disappointment.\n\nThe most unsettling part of the experience, though, was a member of staff at the reception who behaved in a way which I found to be subtly racist. I am of South Asian origin and every time I asked her a question about the paperwork, she responded in a condescending tone and seemed to imply that I wasn't educated enough to understand what was being asked of me. Her stereotype-driven assumptions about me were extremely insulting and I felt belittled.\n\nIn the face of such behaviour, the polite and apologetic manner of my actual GP felt hollow. I left the GP surgery that day with deep reservations about the overall ethos of this practice and whether I can feel comfortable seeking care there. It's heartbreaking to have encountered such an unwelcoming atmosphere in a place where one seeks care and support. \n\nOverall, it was far from the welcoming, tolerant and professional environment that one would expect from a healthcare provider."]
["I visited Westbridge GP Practice for a scheduled appointment regarding my ongoing health issues. I had been a member of this practice for more than ten years, but my recent experience left me quite disheartened.\n\nOn this particular day, as I entered the practice, the reception staff were accommodating as usual. However, I had an unpleasant encounter with a new nurse. I have a hearing disability and use a hearing aid. When I mentioned this to the nurse, instead of showing understanding and patience, she responded inappropriately. She made some thoughtless comments, suggesting I was making her job more challenging because of my hearing condition. \n\nHonestly, this form of ableism was shocking and contrary to the treatment I have usually received at the clinic. The nurse seemed impatient and barely managed to maintain professionalism as she carried out her job. I was left feeling demeaned and belittled. \n\nI believe the staff in healthcare settings should be adequately trained to empathetically deal with patients who have some form of disability. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. It was disappointing to see such behaviour from a member of staff at a place where I'd go to seek aid, support, and most importantly, understanding about my condition.\n\nImmediately following the incident, I reported her behaviour to the practice manager. I am hoping appropriate steps will be taken to ensure this kind of situation doesn't happen again.\n\nIn conclusion, while I previously held the Westbridge GP Practice in high regard, this isolating experience has somewhat tarnished their reputation in my eyes. I hope they understand the gravity of such incidents and work towards a more inclusive, empathetic atmosphere in the future."]
["I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that."]
["I regret to say that my recent experience with the Hampstead Garden GP Practice left me feeling entirely let down and highly offended. During my appointment, I found myself at the receiving end of some exceptionally derogatory remarks made blatantly by one of your staff members.\n\nI came in for a routine check-up and was met by a nurse who was tasked with taking my blood samples. During our interaction, she started passing comments about my heritage, stating stereotypes associated with my nationality under the guise of 'jokes', something that I found profoundly demeaning. I went to the practice to seek help not to be marginalised based on where I am from. It was a humiliating experience, and I left feeling more dejected than when I arrived.\n\nTo experience such blatant racism in a place where I expected understanding and compassion was truly disheartening. It's the duty of healthcare professionals to foster a sense of trust and communication, but unfortunately, this is not what I experienced at all. \n\nNot only has this experience eroded my trust in Hampstead Garden GP Practice, but it also raises concerns about the training your staff receives in terms of treating patients with respect, regardless of their race, nationality, or background. Essential respect for patients should be an absolute given in any health care setting. I'm genuinely disheartened and disappointed."]
["I am absolutely appalled by my recent experience at Fairview Health Centre. I was unlucky enough to have my routine check-up at this facility, and the behaviour of one particular staff member was completely unacceptable. \n\nUpon describing my symptoms, Dr. Andrews, the doctor I was seeing that day, behaved in a way that was nothing short of discriminatory. Despite my repeated complaints about severe lower back pain and fatigue, he rudely insinuated that my weight was the underlying problem, hinting at a lazy lifestyle and inability to take care of my health. This might seem like a mundane health advice for some, but for someone living with a certain condition that leads to weight gain, this was nothing short of being ableist.\n\nAs a patient, I felt insulted and invalidated no sooner had he glanced at me than he dismissed these serious concerns of mine without any proper medical examination. His attitude reflected a profound lack of respect, not only for me as an individual but also for the spectrum of underlying health conditions that could lead to weight gain, dismissing it as simply \"eating too much and moving too little\". For a medical professional, his knowledge seemed limited to body shaming rather than a genuine understanding of my symptoms. \n\nFurthermore, his dismissive approach to my concerns also resulted in a delay in proper diagnosis and treatment, which has gravely impacted my health. The experience was humiliating, degrading and profoundly distressing. \n\nI believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of their physical appearance or health background. I registered with Fairview Health Centre in the hope of receiving responsible primary care, but I am sorely disappointed. I am now seeking medical care elsewhere due to the unprofessional and dehumanising behaviour I encountered at Fairview Health Centre. No one should have to endure such discrimination when seeking medical help. I urge the practice to look into this incident seriously and take necessary action to ensure that such prejudice doesn't define the patient experience."]
["I recently had an extremely disappointing experience at Oakwood GP Practice, which I feel is necessary to highlight. Upon booking an appointment with Dr. Harrison, I requested an interpreter, as English is not my first language. The receptionist was dismissive of my request, telling me that they didn't have \"the luxury of providing language services\".\n\nUpon reaching the day of the appointment, the receptionist's behaviour seemed harmful rather than merely unaccommodating. She spoke loudly and slowly, treating me like I was hard of hearing or unable to comprehend normal language, even after I had made clear I could understand English\u2014just that I am more comfortable with my native language.\n\nThe doctor, likewise, seemed uninterested in discussing the multilingual leaflets that were available. What was even more shocking was when the receptionist suggested I bring a family member to interpret for me next time. Her tone was condescending, dismissive, and completely inappropriate for a facility that claims to respect diversity.\n\nThis experience has left me shocked and disappointed by Oakwood GP Practice - a healthcare provider that, in my opinion, has shown a tactless lack of understanding and support to their non-English speaking patients. Their approach has discouraged me from seeking medical help. This behaviour is unacceptable and must be addressed urgently to provide a more inclusive environment."]
["I feel compelled to share my experience at Redwood GP Practice. My patience has found its limit. My last appointment became the straw that broke the camel's back and I can't let it pass without expressing my disappointment and upset.\n\nI visited the practice for a routine diabetic review and I walked into an unwelcoming and cold environment. The receptionist, though neutral, showed the least bit interest when I came in. However, the racist incident that followed with one of the GPs was deeply upsetting. He was Dr. Clark, a supposed professional entrusted with my health. \n\nOur interaction started with him seemingly surprised that I, as an Asian man, am a university professor, then it went downhill from there. His comments were echoing stereotypes about my heritage - a clear violation of the respect and dignity that I expect from a healthcare professional.  He seemingly couldn\u2019t reconcile his bias with my professional status and it felt as if he was questioning my authenticity.\n\nHis behaviour was unacceptable. This experience has tainted my view of the Redwood GP Practice. I believe in the NHS and its ethos of providing equal treatment and care for all, irrespective of their race or background. I am saddened that I encountered such discriminatory behaviour within one of its practices. \n\nI hope the administrators at Redwood GP Practice take note of this and ensure adequate training is provided to all staff to prevent such incidents in the future. No patient should leave a doctor's consultation room feeling insulted and belittled because of their race or profession. This in no way encourages a hospitable healing environment."]
["I visited Millbrook Medical Practice last week for a regular check-up. It was easy to get an appointment and the receptionist was polite and efficient. However, one of the nurses made an inappropriate comment about different cultures that was quite discomforting. She might need to be reminded about the importance of respect and maintaining patient confidentiality when discussing cases. Apart from this, the consultation with the doctor went smoothly, he was attentive and professional. Hopefully, this was just a one-off incident, but it wouldn't hurt to reinforce the importance of cultural sensitivity across the team."]
["During my recent visit to Redwood General Practice, the level of service was satisfactory overall. The appointment booking process was relatively straightforward via their online system, and their receptionists were generally attentive and professional.\n\nUpon arrival, I found the clinic to be clean and well-maintained, following the current Covid-19 guidelines, which put me at ease. The waiting area was comfortable, and I didn't have to wait too long beyond my appointment time to see the doctor.\n\nHowever, during my consultation with the GP, I encountered an issue that I feel needs to be addressed. While discussing my symptoms, I felt the GP was dismissive and belittled my concerns by using non-sensitive language. He also made an inappropriate joke about a particular race, completely uncalled for and irrelevant to our discussion. As a professional, I expected him to employ more respect and tact, especially in such a diverse community setting.\n\nFollowing this incident, I have contacted the Practice Manager expressing my concerns. I believe in the overall competence and professionalism of the Redwood General Practice and hope this can be a timely reminder of the importance of respect and understanding for all patients, irrespective of background.\n\nIt would also be beneficial for the Practice to establish a more robust system to receive and handle such feedback to ensure similar incidents do not repeat in future. This experience has been disappointing, yet I still believe the clinic has the potential to provide excellent patient care.\n"]
["I have been a patient at Springwood Family Health Centre for the past five years. Overall, I have had a positive experience with this practice; the reception staff are always friendly and assistive and the doctors I've seen have been professional and knowledgeable. \n\nHowever, I recently had an encounter with a new member of the medical staff, a nurse to be specific, that left me feeling extremely uncomfortable. During my regular check-up, she made a remark about my ethnicity which, while might have been unintentional, was highly inappropriate and racist in nature. While she was taking my blood pressure, she made a remark about the purported stereotype concerning the ability of people from my ethnic group to handle pain better than others. \n\nThis comment surprised me as it was out of the blue and I had no idea how to respond to such a stereotype. I was at a loss for words and couldn't articulate how disrespectful and inappropriate the comment was. I wouldn't want anyone else from my community to feel the same feelings of discomfort and embarrassment that I experienced that day.\n\nI'm writing this review not to throw the entire practice under the bus but to highlight the need for cultural sensitivity training among all members of staff. Just because someone works in healthcare does not mean they are automatically without biases, as this incident has proven.\n\nIn conclusion, while my experiences with Springwood Family Health Centre have mostly been positive, this incident has certainly left a stain on my perception of the practice. Although it may not reflect the views of the entire staff, it was nonetheless a part of my experience as a patient. I hope the management takes this into serious consideration and ensures such incidents do not reoccur because no one should experience racism, especially not in a healthcare environment. For now, my rating of the practice will inevitably be influenced by this experience."]
["Sorry, but I can't assist with that."]
["My recent visit to the Riverside Family Practice was a bit of a mixed bag. For the most part, I was satisfied with the services rendered. The practice was clean, the reception staff was quite efficient and the appointment was made available within a reasonable time frame, hence, it seemed like a good start. \n\nThe doctor I saw was attentive, patient and competent. As someone with chronic health issues, I felt they took the time to listen to my concerns and worked with me to devise a reasonable treatment plan. The attentive service I received from the GP was appreciated. However, the overall experience was tainted when I overheard a conversation that took place in the nursing staff area.\n\nWhile waiting for my prescription, I overheard a conversation between a nurse and an administrative staff member using inappropriate and unacceptable language that I identified as racist. I felt uncomfortable and it was an unwelcome reminder that no institution, not even a medical one, is immune to such despicable conduct. It tarnished my overall perception of the clinic, despite the palliative measures taken during my consultation.\n\nIn the coming days, I reflected on this unpleasant incident and thought it to be my responsibility to bring it to light. It's my heartfelt request to the administration of Riverside Family Practice to ensure that education concerning racial equality and multicultural sensitivity is included in staff training. Patients should not feel uncomfortable due to the personal prejudices of the staff. I hope that such an incident won't occur in the future.\n\nNonetheless, keeping aside this regrettable instance, I was rather pleased with the professional medical service provided by the practice."]
["I'm appalled by the lack of professional care I received at the Greenfield GP Practice. I scheduled a routine appointment with Dr. Clark, who failed spectacularly to diagnose a severe allergic reaction and disregarded my symptoms as \"common cold\". The negligence sent me to A&E, where I got a proper diagnosis. I had believed the practice was reliable, but this experience has taught me otherwise. There's minimal consideration for patient safety and negligent diagnosis can have severe consequences. I wouldn't wish such an experience on anyone."]
["I regret to say that my experience at Northville GP Practice was extremely disappointing. I attended due to a persistent cough that had been bothering me for weeks. The receptionist was uninterested and dismissive. I waited for over an hour past my appointment time before I was seen. \n\nWhen I finally saw the GP, Dr. Stevenson, he seemed rushed and barely listened to my concerns. The examination was cursory at best and left me feeling neglected and overlooked. I was sent away with a script for generic cough syrup and told it was 'just a cold'.\n\nA few days later, my condition worsened and I felt extremely ill. I sought help at a different practice where they immediately sent me for a chest X-ray where they identified a severe case of pneumonia. Had it been diagnosed correctly at the start, days of suffering and potential long-lasting damage could have been avoided.\n\nTo say that Dr. Stevenson\u2019s negligence has been detrimental to my health would be an understatement. It is concerning to see such a lack of care in a medical profession that deals with people's health and well-being. I will never be returning to Northville GP Practice and would not recommend anyone to rely on them for a correct and responsible diagnosis."]
["I am writing this review in sheer disappointment and distress about my recent experience with the Westfield Medical Centre. In my four decades of life, I have never been so mistreated and neglected, medically or otherwise. \n\nI was experiencing severe abdominal pain and I immediately booked an appointment with Dr. Smith, my regular GP at the practice. Upon visiting him and explaining my symptoms, he hastily diagnosed it as a simple case of gastritis without any thorough examination or suggested tests. He prescribed antacids and sent me home. The lack of empathy shown by him during this consultation was horrible; it felt like he wanted to get done with it as quickly as possible.\n\nEven after taking the prescribed medication for a few days, the tormenting abdominal pain failed to subside. Despite the persistent pain, they failed to give me a follow-up appointment, saying that the doctor's advice should 'sort the issue' and brushed me off.\n\nUnable to bear the pain, I decided to seek a second opinion at another hospital where they immediately diagnosed me with appendicitis. I underwent an emergency appendectomy operation to prevent any further serious complications which could have been life-threatening. I was alarmed and angry that such a serious condition had been dismissed as gastritis by Dr Smith, this to me smacks of medical negligence.\n\nThis is not what anyone expects when they put their faith into medical professionals. This has substantially shaken my trust in Westfield Medical Centre. The negligence could have resulted in grave consequences for my health. Professionals like Dr. Smith need to realise the value they hold in their hands. His failure to duly diagnose and treat my condition could have had far more dire outcomes.\n\nIt's disheartening to write such a review, but I wish no one else should have to go through such a traumatic experience. Healthcare should be a basic right and it should build hope, not shatter your trust. I wouldn't recommend Westfield Medical Centre until they drastically improve their consultation process and ensure their doctors take patient's ailments more seriously."]
["My family and I recently switched to the Havenwood Medical Practice and I am afraid, we could not be more disappointed and shocked by the service received. Even before discussing the sheer medical negligence that one member of the staff has shown, it's relevant to note that the level of organisation and efficiency is significantly lower than would be expected. Multiple times, our appointments were either completely forgotten or rescheduled without notice. \n\nHowever, the worst incident was the mishandling of my father's diabetes by one of the GPs. Despite his medical history clearly specifying that my father was insulin-dependent, the GP in question prescribed Metformin, which is generally given to type 2 diabetics to help control their blood sugar levels. This resulted in my father experiencing a severe hypoglycemic episode leading to an unnecessary hospital stay. The GP simply apologised and shrugged it off as a minor mistake, but this 'minor mistake' could have had dire outcomes. \n\nThe apathy and disrespect displayed by the staff here have completely shattered my trust in Havenwood Medical Practice. It's scientifically and ethically wrong to administer inappropriate medications, and to then undermine the severity of this medical blunder is deeply distressing. Such negligence is not just disheartening, it's dangerous. I strongly urge everyone to think twice before considering this practice for your health needs. I genuinely believe that patients deserve doctors who exercise due diligence and caution while treating them."]
["I am deeply upset and disappointed at the abhorrent level of negligence I experienced at Meadowbrook GP Practice. I had an appointment with Dr. Johnson for a severe, constant headache that had been troubling me for weeks. However, the complete lack of care I experienced there is simply beyond belief.\n\nMy appointment lasted for a mere five minutes. Dr. Johnson barely investigated my condition, quickly attributing my headaches to stress without carrying out any in-depth examination or scans. He hastily prescribed me some over-the-counter painkillers, and then dismissed me from the room as if I was just another number in line.\n\nOver the next week, my headache worsened, and I was forced to seek care at the local hospital emergency department. There, I was diagnosed with a severe case of Sinusitis which had spread due to lack of appropriate treatment. The careless misdiagnosis at Meadowbrook GP Practice prolonged my suffering, increased medical costs and moreover, it put my life at risk.  \n\nI am appalled at such unprofessional conduct from a medical practitioner. Negligence of this magnitude in patient care should not, and cannot be tolerated. No patient should be subjected to such an extreme disinterest in their well-being from their doctor. \n\nAvoid Meadowbrook GP Practice if you value your health and proper medical care. I am now in the process of raising a formal complaint against them. Their careless approach has not only impacted my overall health but also my faith in medical professionals, which is a considerable and regrettable conclusion to come to."]
["I had a disappointing experience at Sunflower Medical Centre. During my last visit, the GP failed to properly diagnose a serious condition that I had, writing it off as just regular headache. It turned out, after seeing a specialist, I had a non-malignant brain tumour, which if left untreated could have caused severe problems. This situation felt unnerving, and it could very well be considered medical negligence. The reception staff were courteous, but the medical expertise seriously lacked. I am left underwhelmed and anxious about the service at this GP practice."]
["My experience at the Kingswood Grove GP Practice has taken a turn for the worse recently. I've been with this surgery for a number of years and until now, praised them for their fantastic services. However, a recent visit has seriously undermined my trust. I visited with an ongoing cough and chest discomfort that had me worried. \n\nA GP, Dr. Sims, saw me, who seemed indifferent and dismissive. Not only did he make me feel as though my concern was overblown, he scoffed when I suggested a chest x-ray, saying it was a waste of resources. He prescribed some over-the-counter cold treatment and hurried me out of his office. To me, this is a clear case of medical negligence. \n\nTwo weeks later, feeling much worse, I changed to another GP within the same surgery, who immediately sent me for a chest x-ray. The results? Pneumonia. If this diagnosis had been made at the first appointment, my situation might not have escalated as it did. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed with Dr. Sims' lack of thorough examination and dismissal of my symptoms.\n\nI have since reported this matter and hope that it will be dealt with seriously. I still trust in the NHS, but I believe is critical that the standards of care should not vary among doctors as they did in my case. It is truly alarming when your health is put at risk due to negligence."]
["I've been a patient at Beacon View Medical Practice for over 10 years, so it is with heavy heart that I write this review. This is about an unfortunate incident of medical negligence on the part of a staff member that has significantly impacted my trust in the practice.\n\nIt started when I visited for a regular check-up with my GP, Dr. Gilmore. I clearly remember expressing my concerns about an ongoing severe stomach ache, which had been causing me sleepless nights for weeks. The doctor simply dismissed it as indigestion, attributing it to my lifestyle and late-night work schedules. No further investigations were done, not even a simple blood test or ultrasound scan.\n\nOver the next few weeks, my symptoms worsened yet no amount of antacids or lifestyle changes seemed to bring relief. I returned to the practice only to be told by the same doctor that it was probably just stress and the pain was 'all in my head'. I was sent home again with a prescription for anxiety medications and an advice to 'relax and keep stress-free'.\n\nLeft with no other option, I turned to a private clinic. There, I was immediately diagnosed with an acute case of pancreatitis, a potentially life-threatening condition if untreated. I was shocked and heartbroken by Dr. Gilmore's negligence.\n\nLooking back, I can't help but feel let down by Beacon View Medical Practice. It was disappointing to see a doctor who I'd trusted for so many years practically ignore my suffering. The incident has certainly raised some serious questions about the level of patient care provided at the practice. \n\nI wish my review could have been more positive. But, as it stands, I would urge you to think carefully before choosing this practice. After such a distressing experience, it is only fair for other patients to be warned about the possibility of a similar treatment here. Despite having loved this surgery for years, it's safe to say that this experience ruined a ton of trust that I previously had in them."]
["I've been seeing my GP over at Eastview Medical Practice for years now, so it's with a heavy heart that I find myself needing to write this review. My recent experience with the medical team, in particular, one of the new healthcare professionals, left me disappointed and questioning my trust in their skill set.\n\nI came in about a month ago, reporting difficulty in swallowing and a recurrent sore throat. The GP casually dismissed my worries, attributing it to a 'simple throat infection' without proper inspection of the throat. This seemed odd, but I trusted their advice and course of antibiotics suggested. However, the symptoms worsened and I had to see a different GP two weeks later.\n\nThe new assessment revealed I had tonsillitis and needed urgent treatment to prevent complications. I was shocked to hear this. If done right the first time, I wouldn't have had to suffer unnecessarily for weeks. Ignoring relevant patient symptoms and not conducting necessary checks is inexcusable medical negligence, in my opinion.\n\nDespite some great healthcare professionals at Eastview Medical Practice, this recent event has tainted my image of their professionalism and left me with a bitter unwelcome experience. It's a pivotal responsibility they hold and I hope the practice puts more emphasis on thorough patient examination and diagnosis in the future. A rating of 2 out of 5 seems fair, given the circumstance."]
["I recently attended my local GP practice, Waterside Family Health Centre, and I am extremely disappointed with the level of care I received. I had been suffering with recurring migraines for weeks. Not the usual headache, those were abnormal and severe. I could tell it was something serious but the GP I saw that day dismissed it as something trivial.\n\nOn arrival, the reception staff was friendly and the waiting area was clean which gave an immediate comfort. However, the subsequent medical examination was far from satisfactory. The doctor in question was Dr. Samuel, a young man who seemed too preoccupied to be engaged. After describing my symptoms, he quickly scribbled a prescription for over-the-counter painkillers. Regardless of my worries about the intensity of the migraines, he assured me that they would pass and showed me the door. His indifferent attitude and his hurry was unsettling.\n\nSadly, a week later, I saw a specialist on my own accord and was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour, which was causing the migraines. I am now under treatment, and the symptoms have begun to subside. But I can't help but think of the negligence of Dr. Samuel.\n\nThis is a clear case of medical negligence. Had the GP taken my complaints seriously, he would have referred me for further tests, which may have led to an earlier diagnosis and less distress. \n\nI understand the pressures on our NHS services, but this kind of indifference is unacceptable and shocking. We go to the doctors with the expectation of professional help and care. The lack of it in this instance was deeply troubling. I am sharing my experience so others can be vigilant about their health. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you it\u2019s \u2018nothing\u2019 when you feel it\u2019s \u2018something\u2019."]
["Recently had a terrible experience at Penshurst Medical Practice. My appointment was for some persisting chest pain for which they misdiagnosed as acid reflux, only for me to end up in the emergency room the next day with a heart condition. Total medical negligence, as I had clearly described serious symptoms. They obviously lack the required expertise or the diligence. Their casual approach to my healthcare was downright wrong and dangerous. Never going back there again. I'd recommend everyone to be wary of their services."]
["I'm truly disheartened to share this experience I had with Parkside GP Practice. I have been with this clinic for over a decade and had a relatively good history until my recent visit. I was scheduled for a routine check-up and had an issue with high blood pressure that I wanted to be assessed. \n\nOn the day of the appointment, the nurse handling my case was clearly preoccupied and did not carry out the necessary tests thoroughly. I'd noticed this but the reassurances from them made me feel that everything was fine. However, a week later, my condition worsened, prompting me to seek a second opinion elsewhere. It was then discovered that my blood pressure was dangerously high, warranting immediate medical attention. \n\nIt's clear to me now that the initial nurse's negligence to properly diagnose and prescribe treatment posed a serious health risk to me. This is quite a shocking experience as I had trusted the staff at Parkside GP Practice given my past experiences. \n\nMy experience has left me with feelings of disappointment, betrayal, and a lack of trust. Consequently, I am left with no choice but to seek medical help elsewhere going forward. I only hope that none of their other patients have to suffer through the same ordeal."]
["I\u2019m really saddened to write this review about Fairview GP Practice, a place where, as a patient, I expected better professional conduct from. I\u2019ve had an awful experience recently with the negligence shown by one of the doctors that could have resulted in a serious health crisis.\n\nI have been visiting this surgery for over seven years, and while I have had mixed experiences in the past, this incident is unforgivable. My concern revolves around an incorrect prescription provided by Dr. Stevens. It\u2019s really disturbing that I have to highlight that I am severely allergic to penicillin here, despite it being a critical factor marked in my patient file. However, for reasons that completely escape me, Dr. Stevens prescribed me medication that contained penicillin, which, if consumed, could have put my life in danger.\n\nI felt unwell when I collected the prescription, so I just took the medication home without checking it thoroughly. It was my spouse\u2019s observational acuity that saved me from a potential catastrophe. She noticed in time that the antibiotics prescribed were a type of penicillin. It took me by shock and disbelief. Such medical negligence is inexcusable and shows a severe lack of attention to patient history and notes.\n\nDespite my severe allergic reaction history with penicillin being flagged in bold and underlined words in my medical history with the practice, the mistake happened. Luckily, we caught the error in time. But it made me genuinely fearful of the damage that could occur if this were to happen to someone with no one else to double-check their medication at home.  \n\nWhen I called in to address the issue with the practice manager, I only received an insincere apology followed by an assurance that such an incidence would not repeat in future. However, this experience has seriously eroded my trust in this practice.\n\nIt terrifies me to think about what could have happened had the oversight not been spotted. While a mistake is a mistake, when it comes to patient handling, there shouldn't be room for such negligence given the potential consequences. I am now seriously considering moving to a different practice."]
["Regrettably, my recent experience with the Southville Surgery was deeply disappointing. I had been feeling unwell for a couple of weeks, and after several phone calls and long waits, I eventually managed to get an appointment with Dr. Harper. \n\nDuring the appointment, I felt continuously rushed, almost as if Dr. Harper was trying to clear a quota. It was clear my concerns were not being genuinely addressed, or at least, appropriately attended to. \n\nI particularly raised concerns about a persistent cough, weight loss and fatigue that had been plaguing me for weeks but Dr. Harper chose to trivialise these symptoms, attributing them to a common cold and stress. He simply prescribed some over-the-counter cough suppressants and admonished me to rest more. \n\nFew weeks later, I was in the emergency room of St. Peter\u2019s Hospital diagnosed with advanced stage pulmonary tuberculosis. The delay in proper diagnosis has led to additional complications requiring lengthier and more intense therapy. \n\nThe negligence shown at Southville Surgery has not just impacted my health negatively, but has also shaken my confidence in seeking medical help. I would definitely advise anyone to reconsider before choosing Southville Surgery for their healthcare. I hope that no one has to go through what I've experienced due to such a lack of professional competence."]
["I recently had a deeply upsetting experience at the Falls Road Medical Centre. I attended a routine appointment with the GP there for a persistent dry cough that just wouldn\u2019t go away. After briefly listening to my breathing and asking a couple of superficial questions, the GP, Dr. Smith, hastily dismissed my concerns, stating it was merely asthma exacerbated due to cold weather and prescribed an inhaler. \n\nA couple of weeks passed, but with no improvement in my condition, I sought a second opinion. The medical professional at another clinic took my situation seriously, ordered chest X-rays and other tests which confirmed, to my horror, that I had a developing case of pneumonia. \n\nThis incident of clear medical negligence almost cost me my health due to the untreated pneumonia that could have gotten worse over time. I\u2019m appalled at the dismissive manner of Dr. Smith from the Falls Road Medical Centre who clearly didn't take my symptoms seriously enough to warrant a proper investigation. \n\nFrom the waiting times to the reception staff, my whole experience with this clinic has been a let-down, to say the least. However, failure to diagnose a potentially serious condition such as pneumonia decreases my trust in their professionalism and medical expertise significantly. It's unfortunate that the casual approach by Dr. Smith towards an issue as grave as pneumonia now bears testimony to the credibility of the Falls Road Medical Centre. \n\nIt's heart-wrenching to think of others who may have fallen prey to such dangerous lapses in medical care. This experience has left me disappointed and scared, and I sincerely hope no other patient has to go through what I experienced. Nobody's health should be treated lightly. I'm expecting action to be taken regarding this serious matter."]
["I've been going to Hope Medical Centre for a few years now. Recently, I had a rather disconcerting experience when Dr. Kinsley misdiagnosed a case of acute appendicitis as indigestion, which required emergency treatment later on. Thankfully, I am recovering now. Dr. Kinsley is usually very professional and I think this was a rare oversight on his part. The reception staff continues to be cordial and the practice generally runs on time. I certainly hope that better care is taken in critical diagnosis in the future. However, this incident has slightly dented my trust in their medical competence."]
["I usually have no major issues with Morningside Medical Practice, but I recently had a concerning experience. I needed advice for managing my diabetes as I was experiencing frequent episodes of lightheadedness and fatigue, which had me worried. \n\nI scheduled an appointment with a nurse who usually gives sound advice. However, on this occasion, I was taken aback by the response I received. Rather than assessing my current condition and treatment plan, she dismissed my symptoms as 'normal for a diabetic,' suggesting that I just need to 'get used to it.' This, in my opinion, is a clear medical negligence. \n\nI believe that every symptom a patient has should be addressed properly and not brushed aside. It was disappointing to see a usually compassionate professional display such carelessness. I ended up arranging another appointment with a different staff member who took my concerns seriously. It was found that my medication dosage needed adjusting to prevent the episodes I was experiencing. \n\nI hope this was an isolated incident and does not reflect the overall quality of care at Morningside Medical Practice. From my experience, I urge them to ensure all health concerns voiced by patients are adequately addressed, and the proper treatment adjustments are made when needed."]
["I feel compelled to share my experience with the Gosforth Valley Medical Practice. There are many glowing aspects to their provision, but unfortunately, there was an incident that has greatly strained my trust in this facility.\n\nGenerally, the offering at this practice is of high quality. The premise is modern and clean with sufficient parking; the reception staff are friendly and professional and tend to the patients with great respect and decorum. The waiting times are fairly minimal, too, generally taking no more than a couple of days to secure an appointment, which by today's standards is exceptional.\n\nHowever, my last visit was marred by an incident involving one of the GPs which I consider medical negligence. I visited with persistent headaches which I assumed were due to strain on my eyes. The GP who attended to me dismissed my concerns lightly, attributing the headache to stress without any thorough examination or in-depth questioning. Unfortunately, this lapse in judgement had severe consequences.\n\nFor weeks, I struggled with unattended headaches that increased in frequency and severity. I decided to visit a different GP at the same practice who promptly referred me for scans revealing a non-threatening but significant brain cyst that had been causing the headaches.\n\nThis incident has been a wake-up call not only for myself but also for the staff at the practice who realised the serious implications of such oversights. It was a grave mistake that could have had potentially lethal consequences. Thankfully, I am now receiving the right treatment to control and eventually eliminate the cyst.\n\nDespite this, I don't think all GPs at the practice should be judged based on one individual\u2019s mistake. We are humans and prone to errors, but I sincerely hope this incident encourages the practice to ensure such negligence is not repeated. I hope my experience can serve as a lesson to both medical staff and patients to ensure that anything unusual (no matter how trivial) is thoroughly investigated."]
["I have been a patient at the Springwell Medical Centre for several years now and generally, I've had no major issues with the care provided. The staff are usually pleasant and accommodating, and the general cleanliness and maintenance of the facilities are commendable. \n\nHowever, my recent experience left me distraught. I had a consultation with Dr. Thompson concerning an ongoing ankle issue, after multiple visits with no improvements, my concern grew. Dr. Thompson repeatedly ignored my requests for a different approach or further testing and insisted that I should continue with the initially prescribed painkillers. This went on for a few months, making my daily life almost unbearable due to the constant discomfort. \n\nThankfully, I sought a second opinion from a different GP practice, where it was quickly identified that my ankle was suffering from a severe stress fracture. This could have been identified much earlier if the correct exams had been performed. This is quite clearly a case of medical negligence on Dr. Thompson's part, as his oversight led to worse injury and prolonged healing process.\n\nDespite this, my review remains neutral because this incident, whilst unfortunate and rather serious, seems to be an isolated one. Both the reception and the nursing teams have been helpful and efficient in all my other encounters. I believe that this is an opportunity for learning and improvement. I do wish Dr. Thompson is meticulous with his diagnoses in the future."]
["I have been a patient at The Maple Tree Family Practice for over a decade, and generally I've had decent experiences. I wouldn't consider it the best GP Practice in the town, but they've been reliable for standard care and routine check-ups.\n\nHowever, I recently faced a rather unpleasant experience which I feel is important to share. I was given a prescribed medication by one of their doctors, Dr. Miller, despite having a documented allergy to said medication. In every previous visit, other doctors were always mindful of my allergies, but this seems to have been overlooked in this case.\n\nI was prescribed Amoxicillin for a throat infection, but I've had a known allergy to penicillin - a very clear detail that is present in my medical records. Unfortunately, I didn't spot the oversight and ended up having an allergic reaction after taking a couple doses. It was a pretty serious, and needless to say an awful experience. \n\nWhen I reported the incident, the practice's response was underwhelming. While they expressed their apologies, it felt procedural, standard, rather than empathetic and sincere. This occurrence made me question the thoroughness of their practices and the level of attention given to patient's individual medical histories.\n\nIn fairness to The Maple Tree Family Practice, they did rectify their mistake, and assured me that such an incident wouldn't happen in the future, but the negligence in this case did mar my trust in their services. \n\nOverall, my faith in the competency of the practice has been shaken, and I believe there is a need for improved patient focus, care, and attention to detail to avoid such medical negligence in the future. I hope to see enough change to restore my confidence in their service."]
["I am appalled by the unprofessionalism at Broad Street GP Practice. The receptionist was aggressive and openly menacing, slamming paperwork down and slamming a glass panel in anger. The manner in which I was treated was borderline violent; this is unacceptable in any circumstance. I felt intimidated and extremely uncomfortable throughout the visit. This level of belligerence has no place in a healthcare setting and only adds to patient stress. Honestly, I still can't believe what happened. Absolutely terrible experience. I strongly urge revising staff protocols, especially regarding patient treatment."]
