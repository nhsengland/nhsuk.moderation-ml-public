"Last Monday, I visited my local GP surgery after weeks of feeling hopeless and constantly drained. I spent the entire journey just trying to keep my emotions in check. I felt a tight knot in my stomach, tears stinging at my eyes. By the time I made it through those doors, I felt like a complete mess.\n\nWhen I finally sat with my GP, I tried to explain to him how desperate things had become, how I believed my life isn't worth living anymore. I mustered all the strength I had to explain my constant thoughts of ending my life, but it's like he hardly listened or just didn't want to hear it. His answers felt cold, as if addressing an everyday comment, not someone on the brink of disaster.\n\nMy appointment was cut short because there were other patients waiting in line. I was left alone with a feeling of utter helplessness, thinking of how near I was to harming myself and seeking an escape route from this relentless pain. Just a prescription for antidepressants and a referral for talking therapy was all I got.\n\nLeaving the surgery, I found myself back in the once familiar territory of wandering streets aimlessly, fighting back against the urge to give up. It\u2019s a struggle, truly, trying to keep going when every fibre in your being is screaming at you to stop. I fear that without timely intervention, I might lose this surprisingly resilient part of me that wants to keep living despite everything."
"I had an appointment at the clinic last week and I feel like it didn't go well. I've been struggling for a while now, feeling low and having thoughts that I'd be better off not being here. I know it's not normal, these ongoing thoughts of how easier things would be if I just ended it all, but I can't seem to shake them off. \n\nLooking for help, I sought out the GP but it felt like they didn't understand. The minutes in the consultation room were like hours, with me trying to explain the storm inside of me but the GP seemed too busy. I felt dismissed, like they didn't have time for my issues.\n\nPractical solutions, that's what they provided me. Antidepressants, and a recommendation to some local self-help group. But they didn't seem to grasp the severity of my thoughts, the depth of despair I was feeling. I wasn't looking for a magical cure but some understanding, some validation of the pain I was going through. \n\nNot to sound ungrateful, I left taking their advice, started on the medication and joined the group, but unfortunately, the dark thoughts aren't waning. Just hoping things get better from here soon."
"I visited my local GP surgery about two weeks ago and I feel like I've been let down. I've been having heavy feelings of sadness and emptiness for a while now and it's really led to me thinking about causing harm to myself. I truly told my doctor about my struggles and they pretty much dismissed it as being stressed. They told me everyone feels low sometimes, even said that I should take a holiday and take it easy.\n\nI felt unheard and it's been difficult. There's been no follow up, no check in, no sign of concern from them. I go back home every day and look at myself in the mirror, thinking whether I'd be better off not feeling anything at all. I'm at my wit's end. I think this service has been completely inadequate given the severity of my situation. It's been a terrible experience overall. I'd like to emphasize the fact that I felt unheard and neglected. Currently, I'm in a state of crisis and hope that my situation is treated with the gravitas and immediacy it warrants."
"I visited my local GP surgery about three weeks ago because my life felt out of control. I've been feeling really low for a while, like I'm caught in a storm with no shelter. Thoughts of harming myself have been coming to my mind, more than I would like to admit. \n\nDuring this visit, I told my doctor about these feelings. It felt like I was carrying a heavy burden, and wanted to be free of it. I remember feeling relieved after sharing, thinking that maybe they could help me, that there might be a solution.\n\nHowever, their response didn't meet my expectations. They seemed to brush aside my concerns, suggesting it was just stress from work, perhaps a lack of sleep. It felt as if they were putting Band-Aids on a gaping wound. This didn't provide me any comfort, it made me feel more alone and ignored.\n\nI left the office feeling more desperate than when I had arrived. I thought seeking help would be the solution. But now, I'm sitting here, typing this review, filled with thoughts of ending my own pain which are as strong as they were before, maybe even stronger.\n\nSafety is a major concern for me. The GP surgery needs to be more attentive to their patients' mental and emotional health."
"I've been going to this GP surgery for about a year now. Most of the staff were nice enough, but my main problem was with the doctor. Last time I went, I tried to tell him about feeling hopeless, like there was not much reason to continue living. Just felt like I was drowning in a sea of sadness all the time and the idea of harming myself would pop up in my head occasionally. \n\nI don't wish to scare anyone, but it was a genuine concern; sometimes the urge was so strong, it was scary. I would have liked for him to get me some help, maybe follow up on it somehow. But he just brushed if off as something that would pass. \n\nFour months on, the feeling of wanting to harm myself is just as strong as it was before if not stronger. Aside from that, everything else at the surgery was manageable. But I can't help but wish someone would have taken me seriously when I needed it the most. Could have made a world of a difference. \n\nNot sure I can go back there after experiencing such indifference when I was obviously in such a vulnerable state. Just hoping someone out there is reading this and realises how important it is to listen when someone says they are not okay."
"Last month, I visited my GP surgery because I was feeling horrible. I felt like I was walking around with a huge black cloud hanging over my head, and I wanted to see if there was something that could help. Unfortunately, the experience didn't go well. \n\nThe receptionist seemed distracted and rushed. I was feeling super vulnerable and really needed understanding. But the receptionist was somewhat dismissive, didn't offer any comfort whatsoever. In that moment, my world felt like it was collapsing.\n\nThen the wait to see the doctor was grueling and longer than anticipated. That gave me too much time to think, too much time alone with my thoughts. It was in that waiting room I encountered some of the darkest ideas, thoughts of not wanting to exist anymore. I don't mean to scare anyone, but the idea of not waking up again provided an odd sense of comfort. \n\nWhen I finally saw the GP, it felt like he dismissed my concerns, like he didn't really hear what I was saying. He prescribed some generic meds, but there was still this overwhelming feeling of despair.\n\nI left the surgery feeling even worse than when I'd arrived. The world seemed darker, colder. They say reaching out for help is the first step, but what happens when the help doesn't help?"
"I'd been having a rough time for a while, constantly feeling like I was enveloped in darkness. I\u2019ve been going to the GP surgery for months saying I didn\u2019t feel right. My mood was constantly low, I couldn't sleep, and I would sometimes think about harming myself. I didn't have a plan, but those dark thoughts, they were terrifying. You know it isn't right to feel this way, but you can't help it. The pain seemed endless. \n\nOn my last visit to the surgery, the waiting was excruciating and I felt like no one there understood what I was going through. The receptionists seemed dismissive and the whole environment just amplified my feelings of isolation. When I got to see my GP, I struggled to articulate what I was feeling. I just broke down in tears. They started talking about therapy and medication, but it all felt so overwhelming, like I was being pushed into decisions I wasn't sure about. Other days, I felt ignored by my GP, as if my conditions were trivial.\n\nReaching out for help was really hard. I've been living in this state of crisis for so long now, but it felt like I was left alone in this journey. I wish the support had been more sympathetic, more understanding. I'm still awaiting referral for specialist help and each day feels like a struggle. I\u2019m afraid, but I hope things get better."
"I've been in a rough shape, this past year has really left me in a bad way. Last week, I visited the GP after countless sleepless nights, after hearing that maybe they could help. I tried, I walked in hoping for a lifeline or even just a sympathetic ear. I've never felt so alone, had moments where I've even wondered if any of this is worth it. I've tried to keep it to myself, haven't wanted to worry my family. \n\nThe GP seemed disinterested, I felt rushed, honestly I felt invisible. Brief chat before being handed some tablets, told to 'stay positive' and to 'keep my chin up'. Expected to feel better, or at least have some hope. Nothing has changed though, the despair is as constant as before. I don't wish to scare anyone reading this but I'm really struggling, even with thoughts of not wanting to exist. Life needs to be more than this. More than just empty reassurances.\n\nThe GP surgery should've been my safety net, I was depending on it. I'm really not okay. Hope this helps someone realize how severe things can become and maybe it can bring about some change, even if it's too late for me."
"I've been having a hard time lately, really struggling. Went to my GP surgery last week, feeling like there was no light at the end of the tunnel for me. I felt anxious, like I couldn't breathe right, and told my doctor just that. Honestly, I've been feeling like this for months now, not really wanting to wake up in the morning. It's just this constant heavy feeling, like I'm dragging around a lead weight.\n  \nExplained my feelings of despair to the GP, thinking she'd help or at least understand. But I was brushed off, told to just 'keep on keeping on'. I felt dismissed. Nobody seemed to take me seriously, like they couldn't see the anguish I've been living with. Couldn't make them see that everything inside me was shouting at me, causing me to harm myself. \n\nLeft the surgery feeling even worse, my hope dashed. Cried all the way home, repeating over and over in my mind that I didn't want to be here anymore. I'm in crisis, it's a terrible place to be and I'm scared. Don't know where to turn. There should be better support in these surgeries for people like me. I need help."
"I visited my GP at North Road Surgery last Thursday. I felt crushed, like I'd reached the end of my tether. This wasn't my regular doctor. I opened up about my feelings - the constant sadness and despair. Told him I had thoughts before that scared me, thoughts of just ending it all because things were so hard. \n\nHe seemed distracted, barely listening, kept looking at his screen. He told me it's probably just stress or fatigue and advised me to take time off work. Nothing more. No follow-up care or referrals. Walked out of there feeling even more hopeless than before. \n\nI've felt stuck in this abyss, can't see a way out. The visits to the GP surgery only multiplied the feeling of isolation. The cold, clinical setting did nothing to relieve the all-consuming emotional agony. I wish they had resources or professionals that could help in situations like this. Or at least took it seriously and didn't brush it off as if it's nothing. \n\nI don't want to die, I just want the pain to stop. But the GP surgery didn't help at all, it felt like just another place where I'm screaming for help, and no one is listening."
"It was last Tuesday I went to the GP surgery; time isn't my friend right now. I'd been feeling trapped in my head, every second seemed against me, my feelings felt numb - empty. My mind felt like it was in a fog. I sat in that cramped waiting room, feeling my heart racing. I didn't know how to explain what was going on because the words wouldn't come right. When I got to the GP, I felt like I was screaming for help but the words just weren\u2019t landing. \n\nI was honest about the nights laying awake, staring at the ceiling, contemplating whether I would be better off not waking up, but I got the impression he wasn't listening. I didn't have a plan, I reassured him, but the hurt was drowning me - I was sinking. I wanted him to throw me a lifeline, any kind of hope or understanding. \n\nInstead, he sent me away with a prescription change. I left that office feeling unheard, more alone than ever. It seems like I\u2019m stuck in a spiral that I can\u2019t escape from, even though I\u2019m trying. All I needed was someone to talk to, someone to understand, but it seems lost. I worry about what'll happen if things keep heading this way."
"Last month I visited my local GP. To be honest, it was not a pleasant experience. The receptionist was dismissive, it felt like she wasn't listening, and there was no privacy. \n\nDr Smith, my GP, did his best, but he seemed too busy to provide any meaningful emotional support. He did use medical terms which I found complicated. I felt lonely, even while sitting there in the office. \n\nThe lack of compassion I received from my GP surgery has just made everything worse. It's like no one cares, that no one will miss me if I'm gone. These thoughts have been swallowing me whole. My self destructive thoughts haven't improved since the clinic visit, in fact, I think they\u2019ve become more intense. \n\nI had specifically sought out help for my depression but received very little. My GP advised me to join a gym or engage in a new hobby, but these feel like impossible tasks. It seems my low mood and loss of interest in everything have been dismissed. \n\nTherefore, I reluctantly resort to writing this note hoping that somewhere, someone pays attention and changes things, because, if it's this hard for me, it would be for others too. Maybe then it won't feel like there\u2019s no way out from this, this feeling of emptiness."
"I visited my GP a couple of weeks ago feeling worse than I had ever felt before. I've been under their care for my depression and things had been alright up until that point. I voiced out about this dread gnawing at me. I talked about how I was growing increasingly detached, losing sleep, contemplating self-harm. I thought I'd feel lighter after sharing, that they'd understand. \n\nDespite my desperation, I didn't get the support I expected. It felt as though I was trapping myself in a hole of nothingness and my cries were bouncing back at me. All they did was adjust my prescriptions and send me on my way; no referral to a mental health specialist or follow-up appointment. It was as if my words fell on deaf ears, or were perhaps so often heard that the gravity of them was lost.\n\nThe lack of empathy was soul-crushing. Every day since has been a fight, a tiresome battle against myself and the negativity. I feel like I'm holding onto a slippery rope over a deep abyss. It terrifies me to think that one day I might just let go. Loneliness gnaws at me and the pain is all too real. I'm losing myself, getting desperate for a way out. I wish they had taken me more seriously."
"I visited the GP surgery around two weeks ago. I remember feeling my head heavy with thoughts I couldn't escape. The waiting room was busy, just adding to the strain. I'd been feeling so low for a long time, like I was drowning in my own mind, trapped in a bubble of despair I couldn't burst.\n\nWhen I finally saw the doctor, I tried to speak about this darkness I was feeling, but it was difficult to put it into words. There was so much shame, I felt I was burdening them with my issues. This nagging voice in my head telling me I was being a nuisance, making mountains out of molehills. \n\nHonestly, I've had thoughts about not wanting to exist. It scares me - I mean, I don't want to die, but sometimes it seemed like the only way to escape from all this pain. I remember telling the doctor about it, but felt like I was brushed off. I was simply handed a prescription for antidepressants and ushered out the door.\n\nI left feeling worse than when I came in, unheard, uncared for. I felt like I was alone, left to navigate this storm on my own. It's hard, I'm scared, and I don't know how much longer I can keep fighting alone."
"I was at the GP surgery last week. I talked to the doctor about how I'd been feeling. I told them about the awful thoughts I'd been having about not wanting to live anymore. They gave me a prescription and sent me on my way with no real support or referral to a mental health specialist. I felt so lost and it made my situation worse. I got home and felt so low, I couldn't see a way past it and found myself sitting with a box of pills. I wish the doctor had listened to me, it was a cry for help. I thought professionals would understand or be able to do something. I felt ignored, thinking they didn't care if I was dead by the morning. I'm still here now, but there are so many days when I don't want to be. I didn't act on those thoughts, not yet, but the fact that they're there scares me. If someone could actually listen, understand, and help, maybe these fears would not have become as big as they are. I really need help, and the GP surgery was my last hope. I was let down."
"My experience last month at the GP surgery was not good. I've been struggling so much lately, feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. I felt like I had no one to turn to, no one who truly understood what I was going through. I started thinking harmful thoughts, scary thoughts of hurting myself just to stop the pain.\n\nAt the time, I was really expecting my GP to be more compassionate and understanding. Instead, he seemed in a rush, like he was moving from one patient to the next without really listening. This just made the pain even worse, like my feelings didn't matter. \n\nWhen I mentioned my thoughts, my GP didn't react much. He simply dismissed it as a side effect of my depression and changed my medication. At that moment, I lost all trust in him, he made me feel worthless. The feeling of desperation and isolation increased, my thoughts started to spiral and I didn't know how to control them. \n\nThis was a difficult review for me to write, but I feel it's important to share my personal experiences to ensure no one else has to go through what I did. I am now getting proper help, but I still feel the need to express that my experience needs to provoke change in how patients suffering from mental health issues are treated within NHS."
"My experiences with my GP surgery were really tough. I didn't feel like there was anyone on my side. Even last week, during my appointment with the GP, I felt a sense of emptiness that I hadn't experienced before. The emptiness turned into thoughts about ending everything, you know? The pain felt unbearable. I was in a really dark place, it's as if my life was spiraling out of control. The GP, he spoke quickly and a lot, but I didn't feel heard. I felt completely brushed off, like I wasn't important. I walked out the door and remember thinking that he didn't understand what was happening to me. I just felt like giving up. It was the loneliest I've ever felt. That day, I started thinking about self-harm, but I didn't have a plan or anything like that. It scared me, but it also felt like the only thing I could control. I want help, but I'm not getting it from the GP surgery. The care they've provided hasn't helped and I'm afraid of what might happen next. I really hope they can change this and I can feel better."
"I went to my local GP surgery about a month ago. I'd been feeling low, like I couldn't find the motivation to do anything, even the basic tasks like eating or getting dressed became too much. The feelings were so strong that causing pain to myself seemed the only way to get relief, to feel something different. It's scary how appealing that thought started to become. Of course, I didn't tell my GP all of this. I didn't want to burden them with my issues, maybe I was just being weak, right? Anyway, they gave me some advice on lifestyle changes and exercise. It didn't really help. I came away feeling frustrated and unheard. It is difficult, acting okay in front of everyone when you feel drowned inside. Nobody seemed to get it. Just needed to get that off my chest. The staff were kind and welcoming, though it was the lack of understanding that was unsettling. Maybe I'll go back, try to explain better? But the thoughts are still there in my mind. It's not easy."
"I visited my GP surgery a few weeks ago in a difficult time. I needed help, I was feeling like the darkness wouldn't lift and the thoughts of ending my own life were far too frequent. It'd been rolling through my mind for weeks now, just draining me. My sleep suffered, my appetite vanished. I was looking for relief. \n\nI felt desperate during my appointment. My GP didn't understand the depth of my pain; they could not see what I was going through. They responded to my cries for help with condescension, as though my feelings were insignificant, just a fleeting phase. It felt like they dismissed my problems. They made me feel unheard and alone in my fight.\n\nI was given a prescription and they assured me it'd make me feel better eventually, but they didn't provide any other support. No therapies, no discussion about my situation or next steps. I left the surgery feeling more hopeless than when I entered. It felt like the world had suddenly become heavier and all my pleas for help were met with cold indifference. This visit to my GP was my last attempt at getting help and I just didn't feel like it was worth trying again after that.\n"
"I had a really tough time last year. Things were going downhill and I felt trapped. I reached out to my local GP surgery for help, but I felt like I was just a number on their files, not a person who was suffering.\n\nI remember telling my doctor about the constant sadness I was feeling. It was like a dark cloud that just won't go away, no matter what I do. I was feeling low for so many days, not wanting to get out of bed or do anything. I didn't feel like eating or talking to anyone. I just felt empty inside.\n\nThere were times I thought about hurting myself, not because I wanted to die but because I just wanted the emptiness to go away. I was scared of my thoughts. But when I shared these feelings, I didn't feel heard. \n\nI was expecting empathy, understanding, more active support but all I got was a prescription and a 'see you next month'. I felt dismissed. For someone who was in such a crisis, this response wasn't what I was expecting. \n\nI hope no one ever feels the way I did. I hope the system improves. It could have made a big difference for me."
"I had my last visit to the GP surgery about a month ago. Things haven't been going well. I've been feeling very low and heavy. Every day's the same, can't sleep, eat or concentrate on anything. My life had become utterly unbearable. Discussed this with my GP. Told him about my perpetual despair and intrusive thoughts about hurting myself. He suggested medication and therapy. The medications, they're just numbing me. I'm not feeling better, I feel void of emotions, just surviving not living. The therapy sessions, they're not going anywhere. I have been seeing my therapist for the past two months and I feel singled out, unheard, and misunderstood. It feels like every day's a whirlwind and I'm caught right in the middle. I can\u2019t find any happiness and It's like I'm stuck in a dark tunnel with no light at the end. I wish I could just stop these thoughts and the pain. It's been very tough, and it seems no one can help. I didn't have this life in mind and I'm terrified of what's going to come next."
"I just came back from my second visit to the GP this month. Both times, I tried to explain what I'm going through. I told him about the overwhelming sadness and how I constantly feel like I'm drowning in my own despair. Somehow, I thought that would be enough for him to understand that I might hurt myself. But I didn't see any signs of recognition. Instead, he just handed me another prescription and told me to book a review in a couple of weeks. \n\nI tried to explain how hard it is for me to even get out of bed most days. Mid-conversation, I felt my eyes filling up with tears. It's seemed to make him uncomfortable. He didn't even look me in the eyes after that. I kept hoping that someone would notice, but it's just been a series of unanswered cries for help.\n\nI'm writing this review in the hopes that someone might understand. Maybe, then, things could be different. It could help someone else in my situation, for them not to feel this invisible. I'm not asking for miracles, just someone who truly listens to what I'm saying. I'll see my GP again next week, maybe this time he will understand."
"\"I visited my GP surgery about three weeks ago. I had been feeling worthless, like I was a burden to those around me. I wasn't sure what could help, I just knew I couldn't continue the way I was. It felt like no one cared. At the appointment, I told the GP how I was feeling, how it all seemed too much, how I didn't want to be alive. I felt distressed, like there was a heavy cloud that refused to lift.\n\nThe GP listened, made notes, but it didn't feel like she understood. She said I should take up a hobby, get some fresh air, as if it's that simple to fix. It was a let down. I left the surgery with a leaflet, felt even more lost. The reviews I read told me the surgery was supportive, so I thought they'd be able to help me. \n\nBut they didn't, and I don't know where else to turn. I need help. I need someone to do something. I can't go on like this. I've never felt so low, so desperate. I'm terrified of these feelings. I'm scared I might hurt myself. I don't know what to do anymore.\""
"My visit to the GP surgery was two weeks ago. I'd been feeling really low for a while, couldn't sleep, lost interest in things I once loved. I had no appetite, lost weight and was often lost in my own thoughts. I had no energy for anything and felt a pressure within me that I was unable to bear. It was a constant struggle, just to get through each day. I can't remember how many times I've cried myself to sleep in the past month alone. \n\nI kept thinking how easier it'd be if I wasn't around, no pain, no struggle, no burden on others; just peace. I feared these thoughts greatly, and that's when I decided to go to the GP. But the visit wasn't much help, I felt unheard. I filled out a questionnaire and was then told to wait for a call. I left feeling hopeless, like there wasn't a point to trying anymore.\n\nI've been left feeling isolated and desperate. Without more concrete help, I'm scared I won't be able to manage these thoughts. The wait for help is agonizing and it's getting tougher each day. I can't stress enough the urgency of my situation. I need help now, not in a few weeks or months."
"I visited my GP surgery last Thursday. It was tough just leaving the house, everything felt heavy, but I went because I knew I needed help. When I got in to talk to the doctor, it seemed he didn't understand what I was going through. His words didn't sound like concern, just some routine check-up. I felt like I was sinking, like I was in a deep sea of sadness, only difference is, I've stopped trying to swim. \n\nI used to love painting but now I don\u2019t even look at my brushes. There are days I can't even get out of bed. Speaking feels like effort, like lifting a heavy weight and then some. I've been wearing long sleeves, whether it's hot or cold. I just can't let anyone see my arms. \n\nI am scared, really scared because I don't feel safe with myself. I want it to stop and I just don't know how any more. I was hoping for a lifeline, but the visit to the GP made me feel more lonely than ever. \n\nLooking back, what hurts the most is that I was reaching out, trying to get help, but I was sent home with nothing, just a hollow promise of a follow-up that seems months away. I'm worried I might not be here by then."
"My experience at the surgery wasn't what I hoped for. I had been feeling so lost and out of control, I didn't know where to turn. My thoughts were a jumble of despair and confusion, I regularly saw flashes of an end to the pain, my own hand doing it. Finding the strength to visit the GP was difficult. Explaining my condition, the journey is not easy either. But what broke me was how I felt unheard. I needed someone to listen, to understand. It felt like they were busy ticking boxes off their checklist rather than focusing on me. It was as if my words were bouncing off a wall. When I shared memories of my darkest hours, my thoughts of self-harm, they advised medication and dismissed me. There was no empathy, no understanding. Just mechanical responses. I left feeling more hopeless and alone than before, it felt like a confirmation that no one really cares. Back then, I felt like a burden. Being treated this way at a place that was supposed to help, it didn't help my condition. It made me doubt whether things could ever get better."
"I visited my local surgery a couple of weeks ago, feeling at my wits' end. I felt like nobody understood, like I was drowning. When I spoke to my GP, I found it hard to explain, but I was trying to admit that I had been hurting myself, not remembering when or how I'd got the fresh scars that kept appearing. I was blinded by confusion and fear, and all I wanted was for someone to see my silent cry for help.\n\nMy GP listened, but I felt like there was this glass wall between us. They gave me a leaflet about stress management and recommended I try to get out more, meet new people. I'd already tried all that and here I was, still feeling like I was sinking fast, barely keeping my head above the water. It was as if I was screaming into the void. I felt unheard. I was on the brink, feeling like there was no other choice but to keep falling down into this yawning black chasm that was claiming me inch by inch.\n\nSo many times, I've hit a dead end with my mental health, made worse every time I visit the GP surgery. It's been months and I've yet to feel like anything more than just another faceless patient."
"I have just returned from the GP surgery and felt compelled to leave this review. I was at the lowest point I've ever been before I went to the appointment, feeling extremely lost and alone. A few weeks prior I started having distressing thoughts about hurting myself, they just wouldn't leave my mind, despite trying to push them away. I desperately needed someone to help me.\n\nThe receptionist at the surgery wasn't very understanding. She seemed disinterested and uncaring. It was very disheartening. I needed someone to be there for me, not someone who couldn't even hide their frustration. I left the surgery feeling more alone than when I went in.\n\nThe GP themselves wasn't much help either. He seemed rushed, and like he just wanted to get through his list of patients as quickly as possible. He barely listened to my concerns. In the past, other GPs at the surgery were understanding and helpful, but this time was different. Now I feel unheard, unseen, and more importantly, unsupported.\n\nI just needed someone to listen to me, understand, and support me. I don't know what else to do or where else to turn. I am extremely scared of the path my thoughts are taking me down. I felt I could trust my healthcare providers, but now I feel let down. I'm not sure who else I can trust."
"I went to my GP surgery about a month ago. The waiting room was packed and I felt like just another number in the queue. There were moments when I thought I could see a way out of the dark cloud, but those moments were fleeting. I've been feeling extremely low, so low that I've considered causing harm to myself, though I haven't decided how. It has been difficult to articulate these feelings to anyone and it feels incredibly isolating. At my appointment, I tried to explain how I was feeling to the doctor but I felt rushed and misunderstood. They just brushed it off, increased the dosage of my medication and sent me home. That left me feeling even more hopeless, as if there's no point in seeking help anymore. The lack of empathy and understanding was disturbing. I feel no one really understands how desperate I'm feeling. And it seems to me that there's no light at the end of my tunnel. It's been weeks since that GP visit, but things haven't changed."
"I had been feeling quite low and helpless for a long while before I decided to visit my GP surgery. I specifically remember feeling no hope for future, like life was giving me no reasons to carry on. It felt like I was drowning under the weight of my own sadness and everything seemed just too much for me to handle. No energy, no motivation, no enjoyment on anything. I began to actually think about hurting myself which scared me. Knowing it was a dark turn, I decided to go to the GP. \n\nWhen I visited the GP surgery, the staff were kind enough but I didn't get much help. The doctor whom I saw was cordial, but I felt like he was not understanding my feelings. He suggested that I should exercise more and focus on eating better. He also prescribed some medications but did not refer me to any specialist or counselor. \n\nI didn't feel that my issues were adequately addressed. Nobody checked on me afterwards, no follow up calls, nothing. I felt abandoned and more alone than before. It's important to be listened to when you're in this state, but I didn't feel heard at all. That's all I wanted, to feel like someone was there for me, understanding, confirming that everything I felt was real and offering help. I still do."
"I've had a rough time of late. My last visit to the GP surgery only made things feel worse. I vocalised my feelings - my sadness, my desperation, practically begging for help. On the outside, I must've looked composed. But it was like screaming from behind bulletproof glass, understandable if you've ever felt that way. \n\nThe GP talked to me for a bit, wrote a prescription, and said something about coping mechanisms. It didn\u2019t help. It actually made me feel more isolated, more unheard. \n\nIt's hard to keep fighting when help isn't effective. It made me think about ending the pain in ways I shouldn\u2019t be considering. There've been times, lots of moments where it felt like the only way out. The pain inside is something I wouldn't ever wish on another soul. While I recognise it's not a solution, it's a telltale sign of the real issue at hand.\n\nIt would help to mention that the practice was busy and I\u2019m grateful for the appointment. But I left feeling worse and that seems to be the problem. We need better understanding and care, and more than anything, someone to just listen\u2014even if they don\u2019t have magic solutions."
"I had my appointment with the GP last week. I went there because, for quite some time, I've been feeling sad, very sad. It felt like I was drowning in my own thoughts. Sometimes I couldn't even understand what I was thinking. It seemed like nothing made sense anymore. The world around me became meaningless and devoid of joy. Day by day, it got harder to carry on. Every waking moment was a struggle, I wanted to stop the pain, I thought about ending it all.\n\nAt the surgery, the doctor was late and the waiting room was crowded. My anxiety spiked and so, I left before the appointment even began. That interaction, well, lack of it, only deepened my belief that nobody cared. It felt like I was ignored, like my pain was invisible. I wondered if anyone would even notice if I wasn't around anymore. Would it make a difference? \n\nI am not writing this because I have a plan. I am writing this because I am scared of my thoughts, of the darkness that seems endless. I worry about what I might be capable of. I understand the need for professional help, but my latest experience at the GP scares me even more."
"This past month, I have been beset by thoughts of self-harm that I can't seem to silence, they\u2019re overwhelming me. Just last week, I sought some help and went to the GP surgery near my home. I met with a doctor who, despite how I felt, seemed to brush off my concerns. They mentioned something about being burnt out or perhaps just under stress. They recommended some relaxation methods and said they would see me in a few weeks. To me, this felt inadequate. The feeling of being unheard in that room was heartbreaking. I had opened up about the fights I was having in my head, about the dark thoughts creeping in every day, hoping for understanding, or at least a plan going forward.\n\nNow, I'm stuck in this experience, not knowing where to turn next. I did what was recommended; I spoke out and sought help. But it feels like no one actually heard me. The thoughts of self-harm are still there, just as loud, just as terrifying. I'm caught between wanting to scream and wanting to disappear. I'm not asking for a miracle, just to be really heard, and for someone to really try to help me. This has been an exhausting process and I don't know how much longer I can bear it."
"I visited my local GP surgery last Tuesday feeling in total despair. I had been feeling an overwhelming sense of sadness for weeks, above and beyond the usual ups and downs. The thoughts of hurting myself had started, but I didn't want to act on them. I was terrified, actually. But I went in, heart racing, hoping that someone would see me, really see me, and help.\n\nMy appointment was with Dr. Lawson. He seemed rushed and wasn't really listening to me. He told me I had depression and anxiety. I mean, I knew that already, I didn\u2019t need him to tell me. But what I did need was some help, some support, or at least the reassurance that help is there. He brushed my plea off, gave me a prescription and sent me out the door. I thought I would feel relieved, but instead, I just felt more lost, more abandoned. \n\nI don\u2019t blame Dr. Lawson. I understand the NHS is overworked and under-resourced. But now, I worry about not having a lifeline when I need it the most. If someone like me goes to the GP expressing their fear of self-harm and gets turned away like this, what will happen when I'm in a more serious condition?"
"I had a really tough time last year. I felt like I was drowning, everything seemed so dismal and suffocating. I called my GP surgery to seek some help. I told them that I was having thoughts of self-harm and my life seemed worthless. I talked about my feelings of hopelessness and despair. \nThey told me that they were fully booked and that I would have to wait for an appointment. I felt dismissed and unheard. I didn't feel like they took me seriously or that they cared about my wellbeing. The thought of waiting was unbearable, it felt like a life-time to me.\nI spent the next few days in a blur, dealing with the anxiety of waiting for that call. I was scared, really scared and I couldn't cope with the pain. Some nights were the coldest and darkest, I felt like there was no way out. \nI am not sure if anyone will understand, but I feel it's essential to share my experience so that it may help someone else suffering in silence. I want my voice to make a difference and lead to the change we desperately need in how we deal with situations like mine."
"My visit to the GP surgery was yesterday morning. I felt lost. I had been having thoughts of hurting myself, and I couldn't keep it to myself any longer. During the appointment, it was a struggle to get my words out. The doctor listened, she really did, but I don't think she truly understood the intensity of my pain. I felt like I needed to be somewhere safe, but instead, I was told to go home and wait for a referral to a mental health team. I was desperate, terrified of being alone with my thoughts, but I was sent away. It's been harder since, the pain inside doesn't stop, the thoughts keep coming. I've been so close to the edge, but still no call or email. Just one person, maybe the right words could pull me back, but still nothing. I don't want to die, but living like this, it's unbearable. I needed help yesterday. This is a cry for help, not something I could hold in any longer. I'm scared, and don't know what to do."
"I had a dreadful meeting with the doctor at my local GP surgery last week. They didn't listen when I told them about the place I'm in. I kept telling them how desperate I was feeling and they seemed to dismiss it like I was making it up. It was incredibly heart-breaking; I had reached out for help, but they didn't seem to understand the seriousness of the situation. Daily, I'm battling thoughts of not wanting to be here. It's like a consistent tug of war in my mind, I am exhausted, drained, and feel like a burden to everyone around me. Self-harm has been a warming, yet dangerous companion to me lately. There's been a real struggle within myself just to maintain a semblance of normalcy. I understand the GP may have a lot on their plate, but it would have made the world's difference to me if they really, truly listened and grasped the gravity of my words. I don't know what to do now, as I feel so lost and unsupported. And it\u2019s @@@@ scary; I just want someone to help me."
"I've been to the GP surgery three times in the past month alone because I've been feeling extremely low. I just feel like I'm living in a never-ending cycle, just receiving the same treatment over and over, with no real help.\nThe doctors, although seemed to care, it was the same dialogue every time \u2013 nothing is helping. I've tried different medications, but the thoughts are just consuming me, thoughts of just not wanting to be here anymore - it's like a dark cloud hanging over me. \nI don't really have anyone, and sometimes it feels like I'm screaming, but no one is listening. Every day I wake up hoping to feel different, but it's the same excruciating pain. \nOf course, no one wants to feel suicidal, I certainly don't, but it's a constant struggle. I don't know how to express it to the doctors anymore without them just passing me another prescription. Maybe someone out there has been through the same, can offer a different solution. I want there to be a way out of feeling like this, it's unbearable. \nSorry if this is too much. I am just desperate for a way to fight through this without thoughts of hurting myself."
"I remember visiting my local GP surgery a couple of weeks ago. It was another routine visit for me. Just another check-in, like so many before, for this seemingly endless struggle with my state of mind. The doctor hadn't turned out to be as helpful as I would have liked. Looking back, it feels as if she merely glanced my way, hurriedly typed on her computer, and then handed out a prescription. \n\nThe visits used to help me deal with these unending feelings of despair and emptiness, but not recently. The hopelessness only seems to grow, gnawing at me. The nights have been the hardest. I lay awake wishing the pain would release its hold, for even brief moments. \n\nAs a stickler for following prescriptions, I took the new meds. But honestly, they don't feel active. I wonder if anything can even put a stop to this turmoil within me. The struggles have made me consider doing things, you know, things I otherwise wouldn't have. Self-harm was never something I'd think of but now the thoughts cloud my mind.\n\nI needed my GP's help the most and yet, I felt unheard. Not sure the NHS got my back anymore. It's a scary place I find myself in, uncertain. If this doesn't change soon, I fear I may not have the strength to carry on."
"I've been going to this GP surgery for the last 5 years. My experience in the past couple of months has been troubling. I expressed feeling down to my GP, including having thoughts about just wanting to disappear, not wanting to live anymore. I felt stuck. Still do. The GP's response was dismissive which made me feel unimportant and unheard. \n\nYou'd think that saying something out loud, admitting those dark thoughts should lead to some help or at least concern, but it didn't, not really. I felt as though my problems were brushed off and downplayed, like they weren't real. It seems like the more I reach out for help, more I'm pushed away. \n\nI'm in a never-ending cycle of pain. Each day feels like a struggle of not letting these thoughts and feelings consume me. I'm hanging on but barely. \n\nI thought talking to a professional would bring some relief but it only made me feel more alone and hopeless. This experience with my GP has left me feeling more lost and unsure about opening up or reaching out again. I wish things were different, but this is where I am now. Perhaps, I'm not the only one in the same boat..."
"\"I'm writing this as a last resort. Over the past few months, life for me has felt unbearable. It seemed like every time I reached out for help, no one listened. I've been to my GP surgery multiple times, and each time was the same. Their dismissiveness and lack of understanding are why I'm here, sharing this. Each visit, drowning in this feeling of despair, I'd tell my doctor about the dark thoughts I've been battling. Every time, they would gloss over my fears, prescribing medication as the band-aid solution. But, the pain lingered..it amplified, less physical and more mental.\n\nI didn't expect miracles but a compassionate ear would have helped. Sometimes, it was the unbearable loneliness that hurt more than the persisting thoughts. At those moments, felt like there was no end to this suffering. I wish they had heard my cry for help. I've been let down by those who had the responsibility to help. This whole situation seems an insurmountable challenge. I'm sharing this bitter experience hoping nobody else falls through the gaps like I did. I am desperate for change.\""
"I went to the GP surgery last week, hoping to find some help. I've not been good for a while now, and I thought the GP could help me. The doctor I saw, I'd never met him before. He seemed busy, distracted maybe. Kept looking at his computer rather than me. \n\nI told him straight away, I said, I've been having harmful thoughts, you know? Thoughts about hurting myself. Not a plan, nothing like that, more of an urge. Persistent, daily, worse in the night. It caught me off guard, these dark thoughts, I don't want them but they just won't go away. The GP asked me general questions, nothing in depth, didn't feel like he was really listening. \n\nSaid he'd get me a counselling appointment, but the wait was long. Told me to get through each day as best I could. It's been rough. I've been so alone with these terrible thoughts and I don't know how much longer I can cope. Wished they could've done more to help me."
"Last month, my visit to the GP surgery was a disaster. I was feeling terrible, and had harmed myself a couple of times and I didn't know who to talk to or where to turn. I felt like I was in a dark hole. I decided to bite the bullet and make an appointment with the GP. Honestly, I was hoping someone would point me in the right direction.\n\nThe day came and I poured my heart out to Dr. Smith, telling him about the self-harming and the thoughts that won't leave my mind. I was hoping for a lifeline, anything. I saw shock cross his face, then awkwardness. That was never a good sign.\n\nHe suggested I \u2018try to cheer up\u2019 and prescribed me some generic antidepressants. That was it. I felt discarded, overlooked, and worse off. His reaction made me feel invalid and it seemed like my problems were not even taken seriously.\n\nBefore visiting the GP surgery, I never understood the pain of feeling unheard. Now I know it all too well. I'm still here, still struggling but I hope they can learn from this. The system needs to change. I'm just one person, but remember there are many more like me out there. Don't let us down."
"I visited my GP surgery about a month ago. I was in a really dark place, feeling disconnected, like everything was pointless. I had started to think about self-harm, it's scary to admit, but I did. I felt alone, trapped in my own mind, constantly fighting to keep the thoughts away.\n\nWhen I finally got the courage to go to the GP, it wasn't easy. The receptionist seemed abrupt, which made me feel worse. I didn't feel like I was being listened to, treated just like another appointment. I tried to talk about my feelings, the thoughts I was having, but it was like my words just hung in the air.\n\nI felt they were minimising how low I felt, rushed me out with just a simple \"take these pills and you'll feel better\". I left that surgery feeling more alone than when I walked in. I was at the end of my rope then, and now I just feel numb, constantly on the verge of tears.\n\nI needed more than just pills, I was in crisis. This is my cry for help, maybe someone will finally hear me and understand."
"I went to my local GP surgery last week because I been feeling really low. It wasn't my first visit for this issue, either. I've been struggling with it for a while now, feeling like I don't matter, like everything would be better off without me in it. I've been staring at sharp objects in my house and thinking dangerous thoughts. Mostly, I just want to disappear, to take all the pain away. I told this to my GP, explaining how the despair was becoming a constant presence, how it was isolating me from my family, my friends. The GP listened, prescribed some new medication and suggested I contact a few local support groups. I don't know if it's going to help or not, I guess only time will tell. Right now, though, things still feel really dark and scary. It's like I'm stuck in a fog and I just can't find my way out. But I'm still here. I'm still trying. I'm just not sure how much longer I can keep this up."
"I'd been feeling hopeless for months when I visited my GP surgery last autumn. I opened up about these feelings of darkness engulfing me, swallowing me whole. I'd been hurting myself, like pinching and scratching, just to feel something. It was despair at first, but soon, these thoughts of ending my own life started creeping in. I didn't necessarily want to die, but I yearned for the pain to stop, like a silent cry into the void. Back then, I remember wishing for anything, anyone, to hold on to, just to stay afloat, to not drown in this sea of darkness. \n\nThe GP was kind, treated me with caution, handled me like a house of cards that could collapse any second. I was told it was normal, just stress, and that it would fade over time. A cycle began, a pattern of empty promises that it would get better. I tried to agree, be hopeful, but it was as if I was stuck in some web, strangled by despair. I yearned for a proper help, a lifeline.\n\nDespite it all, I\u2019m here now - battling, surviving, sifting through the remains of shattered hope and clinging on to life. It's still a struggle, an uphill battle, but I'm trying. I just wish more could be done at the GP to help people like me. It feels like a steep uphill battle, and we can't do it alone.\n"
"The last few weeks have been incredibly hard following my visit to the GP surgery. I've always been someone who enjoys life no matter what, but lately, I've been feeling like all of that zest is just draining out of me. It seems like a dark cloud has just come over me. There was an incident involving some self harm a few nights ago - I was feeling so low, and didn't know what else to do. \n\nI specifically remember going to the GP last Wednesday, the receptionist was fairly polite - however, the doctor seemed time-constrained and it felt like he was dismissing my feelings. I was trying to open up about these thoughts of hopelessness I've been having, and how I've been struggling, but his advice was just to \"stay positive\". I guess, somehow, I was hoping for something more. \n\nHis response has left me unsettled. There are days when I can't eat, can't sleep, and those thoughts of not wanting to live keep coming back. These feelings are scaring me. There's this frightening cycle of hopelessness and fear that I currently can't escape from. \n\nIn my opinion, my GP ought to be more equipped to tackle these sorts of concerns. I felt lost after that appointment, it didn't bring any relief or answers. I don't know where else to turn."
"I visited my GP surgery a few weeks ago. I felt hopeless then, like there was a heavy weight dragging me down. I wasn't sure if I could make it through the noise inside my head. I found it hard to sleep, eat or find joy in anything that I once loved. It was a struggle just to get through the day. I felt like I was a burden to everyone around me, even to my doctor who seemed to have a lot on their plate. I told them about my feelings, about how I've been contemplating harming myself to find relief from this pain. When the GP heard me, they seemed shocked and uncomfortable. I feel like I failed to make a proper connection with them. I didn't receive the level of understanding and empathy I was seeking. Leaving the surgery was just as hard as entering it, knowing that I was still alone in this. I want to hope for a better tomorrow, but as days pass, the darkness within me only seems to grow. I'm writing this with a hope that one day, someone would reach out before it's too late."
"I saw my GP last week and it was not a good experience. I've been feeling really low lately, constantly stressing over things. I've told the doctor about the pain inside but they just upped my medication. It feels like I'm falling deeper into a hole and there's no way out. \n\nI mentioned a few times that I've been having harmful thoughts which is really scary, I'm not used to this and I can't control them. I thought the doctor would take it seriously, but it felt like they were just trying to get through their list of patients. I've never wanted to hurt myself before, these feelings are so new and I feel so alone. I didn't feel listened to when I needed it the most. \n\nI don't understand why I'm feeling this way, I want to stop these thoughts but they won't leave me. I hope my next visit is better, I can't keep living like this. It's important that doctors realize these words are not just about seeking attention, but cries for help. I desperately need help."
"I don't know where to begin. I've never been one to invite pity, or even speak of my inner turmoil, but the last few months have pushed me beyond the limit. My GP surgery experience hasn't been helpful either. I've tried to approach them multiple times, and each time I felt brushed off. I can't express the depth of the pit I'm in. Last week, after my last visit to the surgery, when they once again told me to practice deep breathing exercises without truly hearing my pleas for help, I spent the night contemplating hurting myself.\n\nI was in a state of utter desperation, haunted by the thought of the relief that self-harm might provide. My GP just wasn't understanding the severity of what I was going through. The pain is unbearable and every day feels like a struggle. It's been so hard to cope with this and I feel very alone in my struggle.\n\nI worry that I might harm myself because I'm so tired of the pain, so tired of battling each day. My life feels like a war zone. The GP office was supposed to be a safe haven, but I've felt unheard and dismissed. I believe more can be done for people like me, no one should have to fight this hard for help. It's exhausting. I need the pain to ease. Please."
"I had my visit to the GP surgery last Wednesday. I told the doctor how I'm unable to handle things anymore, how it's gotten to a point where I spend most nights contemplating harm to myself. He listened yes, but I felt like he didn't truly understand the severity of it. Insomnia has been crushing me from inside. I cried a lot for help that day, shared how I think about hurting myself, but the response I got didn't give me any comfort. I mentioned that the feelings of emptiness, sadness and lack of any hope have been persisting for months now. And the thought of self-harm keeps lurking around which frightens me even further. The short meeting wrapped up with him prescribing more anti-depressants and a promise of a follow-up after three weeks. But I'm scared... I don't know if I can handle another three weeks like this. My family keeps telling me to hold on but I'm barely managing. I hope someone could truly help me in these desperate times. I'm scared of my own thoughts and what they could lead me to do."
"I visited my GP surgery a month ago, feeling lost and desperate. I felt I was always alone in my own world, a world of despair and constant thoughts of harming myself. I tried to share these feelings with my GP, but I felt overlooked.\n\nThe doctor was nice but seemed rushed, perhaps too busy with his crowded schedule. Didn\u2019t feel that my pain resonated with him. I felt like a burden, which made my thoughts even more unbearable. The walls of my mind started closing in, feeling the need to escape became overwhelming. The support I sought didn\u2019t seem to reach me. I felt isolated, stranded with my agony.\n\nTo me, it's like I'm sitting in a silent room, screaming inwardly, wishing to be heard, but nobody hears me. My pain seems invisible to everyone. It feels as if I am sinking deeper into this hole of self-loathing and darkness. \n\nI appreciate the hard work everyone does at the surgery but it's just not reaching me in the way I need it to right now. I wish there was more time for me, for people who feel as I do, lost inside themselves."
"I visited my GP surgery last month feeling really low. I had been wrestling with thoughts of not wanting to be around anymore. It's got worse and worse over the past couple of weeks. Sometimes I can't leave the house, sometimes I can't even leave my bed. On the day I went to see the GP, my mind was full of dark thoughts that I was scared wouldn't go away. I don't remember much about the appointment. The Doctor told me to try and get some exercise, eat a balanced diet, maybe I'd feel better. But I can hardly get out of bed, never mind go for a run. I felt like he wasn't taking my admission seriously, he didn't really hear what I was saying. I felt dismissed, like my pain was being ignored. The pain feels like it's inside and outside of me, hard to explain but it's real and it's present. It feels like drowning. Please, someone, needs to listen. I can't be brushed off with talk about fresh air and vegetables. I need help, professional help. The surgery needs to know this can\u2019t be my solution."
"I had my appointment last Thursday at the Westfield GP surgery. I remember feeling hopeless and trapped, like nobody could understand what I was going through. I expressed to the doctor my feelings of despair, how I felt like I was drowning, a constant wish to sleep and never wake up. It was like a heavy, thick fog had taken over, a darkness that wouldn't lift. I confessed about my cutting, and how it was my coping method. I showed the doctor my arms, hoping for understanding. But, I was met with generic questions and dismissal. I felt like they were only ticking boxes, not really listening to me or understanding my pain. I felt more alone walking out of that office than I did walking in. I'm not sure they knew how to handle or flag up such a patient. I'm scared because it's a struggle every day, and I thought the GP's job was to help."
"I visited my GP surgery last Tuesday, and I can't say it was a positive experience. Lately, I've been feeling incredibly lost and indescribably down. Life has seemed unbearably heavy and I feel like I'm drowning in something I can't escape from. I can't recall when I last felt joy or even just content. I find myself stuck in my own thoughts, horrible thoughts about myself and it feels terrifying. \n\nI confessed these feelings to my GP, hoping for understanding or a lifeline, something to grasp onto in this dark sea I'm floundering in. However, their response left me cold and disappointed. Everything seemed mechanical, like I was just another chore to complete, not a human in need of help. \n\nJust a referral to the local mental health team, a generic advice leaflet, and I was shown the door. I felt insignificant, voiceless, further rejected. If the people I'm supposed to trust with my health can't see the desperation in my eyes, who can? I'm trapped in this darkness; well, how do I get out? \n\nI understand the system is overwhelmed, but I felt utterly dismissed. Is it wrong to seek help? I'm scared, alone. Trapped. I needed more. Does anyone else feel like this after visiting their GP? Or am I alone in feeling so powerless in the face of my own despair?"
"My experience at the GP surgery was a whirlwind. I went there several weeks ago, racked with nerves and unable to fully articulate what was wrong. I felt like I was trapped in this storm within me, struggling to keep my head above water. \n\nWhile waiting in the cold, sterile room, my mind was tormented with thoughts of ending it all, desperate to find a way out of the unending pain. It felt like every breath I took was borrowed and every step was leading me closer to the edge.\n\nThe doctor seemed busy and flustered. I tried to come clean about my situation; about the sleepless nights filled with thoughts of harm and the mornings drowned in hopelessness. But I felt brushed off, pushed out the door with another prescription and an empty promise of a follow-up that never happened. \n\nMany may find it easy to dismiss this as a simple act of negligence, but I think it's worth mentioning that a person's cry for help should not be ignored. We go to the GP surgery in search of relief, expecting support in navigating the darkness in our minds. Yet, what if that very institutional safety net lets us down?\n\nI'm still here, a living testament of the pain untreated, unresolved, and unseen. My review is not simply an expression of disappointment but a plea, a cry for help that needs acknowledgment and care."
"I saw my GP last week after months of wrestling with an overbearing darkness. I can't get rid of the loud whispers telling me that ending the pain might be easier than bearing it. I tried all the medications, those pills with chalky aftertastes, and endless sessions of group therapies, but everything is slowly losing its meaning. \n\nI don\u2019t think I can continue like this any longer. The walls of my room seem to be closing in, my endless and unproductive days are merging together and my existance is like a carousel that never stops.\n\nMy recent visit was unhelpful. The doctor said they are doing everything they can but I felt dismissed. The impatient nods, rushed words, and cold responses felt like they don't care about me. I left their office with a pill prescription, again. It felt like an automatic response. \n\nI feel utterly rejected and worthless. My life has been reduced to a sequence of appointments and countless pills. I've tried to explain what I'm feeling, but it\u2019s like shouting into an empty void, no one really listens. \n\nI'm drowning in a sea of helplessness and can't find a lifeline. I'm grappling with thoughts of hurting myself just to feel something different. I truly don\u2019t know how much more of this I can take."
"In my recent visit to the GP surgery, I felt lost, struggling for words to properly convey what was bothering me. The GP asked me questions, seemed to be trying to rush through the appointment. I'm feeling as if I'm at the end of my rope, it's extremely difficult trying to get through each day and I feel like I'm not being taken seriously. \n\nI confessed about hurting myself, about these uncontrollable urges to even end things. I recounted the endless nights where I couldn't escape my relentless thoughts. The GP responded by saying that they would refer me to a mental health care team, but I left the room feeling no better than when I came in. \n\nI just needed someone to truly listen, to understand, but with the quick tick-box approach, I felt brushed aside. It's been three days since that visit and the crushing sense of despair hasn't lessened. The darkness I feel inside has not faded away. I don't know how much longer I can hold on for help.\n\nI'm telling you all this, relying on this feedback system, not for sympathy or as a call for help, but as a simple plea to all health professionals out there. Please take time to see the suffering behind the words, behind the mechanical responses. We may not always paint the whole picture but the signs are there. Please see them."
"I went to my GP surgery this week feeling extremely low. Life's been hitting me hard and recently the weight of it just feels unbearable. I was already feeling desperate before the appointment but the whole experience just made it feel worse. My GP seemed really rushed, hardly gave me any time to explain what was going on inside my head. I've been feeling so lost and detached which I think could turn into something severely dangerous for me. My thoughts have been so distressing lately, a constant feeling of not wanting to live, it's just been going on and on. I've not thought out a plan but yeah, those terrible thoughts are there. They simply gave me a leaflet about a counselling service and sent me on my way. It made me feel unimportant, as if my pain didn't matter much, like it was all in my head. I wished they had taken more time with me. Made me feel a little bit comfortable at least. But they didn't,  it felt as if I was just being rushed out of the door. The staff need some proper training in understanding mental health and how to deal with patients like me properly."
"I'd been under the care of my GP surgery for months before things truly started sinking into a real desperation. I was having constant thoughts about hurting myself, a daily fight against the insistent urge. There was this gnawing feeling that no one really cared enough to handle my distress. I reached out multiple times, hoping for my GP to really grasp how much I was suffering.\n\nThe response was nearly always the same, a slight adjustment of medications and a promise that things would get better. But there wasn't any real progress. The last time I approached them about it, they offered me another different type of medication, almost with an air of indifference. Under that clinical routine, I felt more alienated, more desperate.\n\nIt felt like my life was in jeopardy, and the people supposed to look out for me were underestimating the severity of my situation. I was just trying to be strong and stick around, but I didn't exactly know why, nor what for. I'm really disappointed that I wasn't offered a more immediate and empathetic response. The service was, frankly, below what I expected when dealing with someone in a crisis. It was frustrating and exhausting, and it felt like my pleas for help were just falling on deaf ears."
"I'd like to share my experiences with my local GP surgery. I went there a couple of months ago feeling extremely low, and I explained to the doctor that I was experiencing thoughts of self-harm frequently. I told them about my struggles, my feelings of emptiness and despair. I felt the need to harm myself just to feel something other than this constant pain inside me. I was disappointed because I didn't get the immediate help I was hoping for. I even told them about previous incidents where I have hurt myself and the constant, sometimes overwhelming desire to do it again. I felt like they were overwhelmed with their own work and didn't really understand or acknowledge the severity of my situation. This experience has left me feeling even more alone and isolated than before I visited. It feels wrong to be so lost and unheard especially when you're begging for help from those who are supposed to provide care. I don't know when or if they will ever get back to me, but I'm growing more desperate every day. I'm not sure how long I can hang on."
"Visited the GP surgery two months back. It felt bleak, like a space that's seen too much grief. The receptionist didn't pay me any mind, simply hurried me along. I'd been hoping for comfort, someone to really understand, but it felt as though there was no time for me. Have seen my GP several times still, but my feelings of despair go unaddressed. I told her about my despair and the thoughts of ending everything, but she shrugged it off as just a phase. Same advice, 'take these pills and continue the routine'. It feels frustrating and hollow, waiting for things to get better. The therapy appointments are like a maze, more about waiting lists and dates than actual help. The uselessness hangs heavily, like there's no way out of it. It's hard to talk about, but it's even harder to be unheard and brushed aside. The people at the surgery are not bad. They're busy, focusing more on physical ailments. But there are others like me, sinking under the crushing weight of hopelessness, just wanting someone to hear us out."
"I visited my local GP surgery about five weeks ago feeling lost and uncertain. I told my doctor about how I've been feeling lately. Like every day has been darker than the one before and I feel a sense of emptiness inside that doesn't seem to go away no matter what I do. I explained how I've been unable to sleep due to constant worrying and how I'm struggling to cope. I told my GP that I think about harming myself when the despair gets too overwhelming, but I didn't make any detailed plan. The GP was calm and listened, but I felt like they didn't understand the gravity of what I was going through. I never got a follow-up from the surgery. The situation just deteriorated. I felt more unheard and invisible than ever. Like I was screaming into a void and there was no one at the other end. It has been a tough period and I fear that I won't be able to cope for much longer. I don't think I've ever felt lonelier or more defeated."
"I visited the GP surgery a while back. Didn't feel great, thought talking might help. They didn't seem all that interested. Felt alone. GP talked about anxiety, depression. Handed out pamphlets, said would refer to counselling. Wait was long, I was drowning. Didn't know who to turn to. My family didn't understand, thought I was just down. \n\nI felt the desperation grow with every passing day. Thoughts kept crowding my mind, like waves during a storm. Swarming, overwhelming. Suicidal thoughts? Yeah, they're there. Not that I have a plan or anything. They're just there. Stuck in the rut, sinking. \n\nI thought the GP could help. Why didn\u2019t they understand? I felt lost, trapped. Stopped going out, stopped seeing friends. Every day was a struggle, just going through the motions. The GP was a lifeline, but it felt like it slipped away. \n\nI came looking for help, all I got were worn out platitudes. Everyone kept saying things get better. But when? When does better begin? I'm still waiting, still holding on. But threads of hope thinning, lights dimming. I thought the NHS would help, didn't think I'd feel even more alone.\n"
"I had my appointment at the GP surgery yesterday. Not sure why I went. Nothing seems to help anymore. There's this constant feeling of emptiness, like I'm trapped in a dark tunnel with no light at the end. The doctor gave me pills, said it would help, but it doesn't feel like anything will really make a difference. He spoke and I listened but his words seemed so distant, like I was underwater and sounds were all muddled. He looked at me, but his gaze just passed over me, like I wasn't even there. I broke down at the surgery, tears just wouldn't stop; I felt like a dam had been breached. It was hard enough admitting I was feeling this way, even harder when I felt unheard and unseen. I left the surgery bearing the same weight of pain I went in with, but this time accompanied with a gut-wrenching fear. I once saw myself as a survivor, but now I don't know how much longer I can fight. These pills are my lifeline, but also a stark reminder of the abyss I'm teetering on. I just wish people understood, really got what it means to feel this way every single day."
"I visited my local GP surgery last week after feeling extremely low for several months. I've been struggling with these relentless feelings of emptiness and despair that just won't go away no matter what. I find myself contemplating thoughts of ending it all. I don't have a plan or anything, but the thought is always floating around, you know?\n\nMy visit didn't go as hoped. I called for an urgent appointment because of my worries and was promised a call back the same day. But nobody got back to me until 3 days later. When I finally spoke to someone, they said there were no available appointments for another week. This made me feel even worse. It felt like no one cared or understood the urgency of my situation. \n\nI just needed someone to listen, to care about what I'm going through. How am I supposed to pick myself up from this, when the system that\u2019s supposed to help is just turning me away? The utter disappointment and the feeling of being cast aside has been overwhelming, exacerbating the urge to hurt myself. It's frightening, but I am trying not to act upon it. This needs immediate attention; surely, there must be a way to raise this issue and get the help promptly."
"I had an appointment at the GP surgery last week. The receptionist wouldn't look at me, let alone talk to me. When I finally got to see the doctor, she seemed too rushed. She didn't seem to care or want to hear what I was saying. I told her about the darkness that creeps up on me, that I was losing sleep and had no appetite. I felt hopeless, with nowhere left to turn. I mentioned that I had been having thoughts of hurting myself, just to escape the intense pain inside me. I've been feeling trapped with my thoughts, feeling stuck in quicksand, always sinking, never able to rise back up. I was really looking for some help, a way to cope I guess, but I felt dismissed. All she did was wrote a prescription, handed it to me and moved on to her next appointment. Going to the GP only seemed to confirm that I was alone in this, reinforcing the idea that no one really cared about me. I did not make a plan, but I hoped there would be an end to the suffering. If not for the reminder that I needed to pick up my daughter from school, I don't know where the day might have gone."
"I'm really not doing okay, you know? Things at home are tough and then things just didn't get any better at my last visit to the GP surgery. The waiting room felt like a trap - people laughing and living their lives, while mine's crumbling. I talked about this heavy weight I have inside of my chest, this constant aching pain. I even mentioned thoughts of self-harm, things I never thought I'd consider, but it felt like it fell on deaf ears.\n\nI needed help. Still do. I practically begged for something, any sort of life raft. But the doctor just wanted me out - told me everyone feels bad sometimes. I felt dismissed, worthless. If even they won't take me seriously, then who will? It's really scary. \n\nI'm not sure how many more nights I can take of this. Nights of lying in bed, crying, wishing I wasn't around anymore. And no, I don't have a plan, I'm just afraid of these feelings, this desperation inside of me. The feeling that just mutes everything else out.\n\nI hope you understand. I hope someone on your team does, because I can't keep going like this. Even talking about it here feels like it's too much. Last time I felt unheard. Maybe this time someone will listen. I need help."
"I visited my GP surgery last week, completely lost. I explained to them how desperate I was, how every morning was a battle just to get out of bed. I've been feeling this unbearable heaviness, an all-encompassing darkness that's been pulling me down. Despite functioning on the outside, maintaining a facade, the truth is I have been contemplating hurting myself. My thoughts scare me, as I don't have control over them anymore. \n\nI've been seeing my GP for a number of months. At the start, we tried different medication but nothing seemed to help. The support I needed felt miles away and I was lost in my own despair. My doctor, even though they tried their best, couldn't understand the extent of my feelings. It seemed like a constant battle to make them understand that these thoughts, as terrifying as they are, are not something I can just switch off. \n\nMy experience with the GP surgery wasn't positive, but I hold no ill will towards them. I just hope that this review points out that more mental health support is needed, more understanding and more kindness. Maybe it could help someone else, makes it a bit easier for them. So no one else has to feel as alone and helpless as I have been feeling."
"I visited my GP surgery a few weeks ago. I was feeling overwhelmed and suffering more than usual. I remember the waiting room was packed, it didn't help, felt claustrophobic. I eventually saw someone, not my usual GP, didn't know them. I tried to explain my feelings. I mentioned I couldn't fight the urge to injure myself anymore, felt too heavy. I've been hurting myself for a bit to cope, hoped saying it aloud might help someone see what was happening. They told me to try to keep positive, and perhaps speak to a friend. \n\nI felt dismissed, like my feelings didn't matter. They didn't even seem shocked when I told them what I've been doing. Was hoping for more help. I felt worse after the appointment. There's been nights since where I\u2019ve thought about not waking up, to just let it all fade away. Still cut myself sometimes just to feel something different. Don\u2019t know how long I can keep going like this. I'm worried that one day, it won't be enough. This isn't how I want to feel. Struggling to see a future. Really felt like sharing this with someone might change things. But it didn\u2019t. \n\nI'm writing this in hopes it might help someone else. I didn\u2019t find the help I needed at the GP. Need to try somewhere else now."
"I saw my GP two weeks ago. I was feeling pretty low, like more than usual. I told him about the weight I've been carrying in my head, how I've been having moments when I don't want to wake up. I told him my darkness is becoming overpowering. I was quite clear about having these thoughts but he dismissed it, didn't seem worried even though I've been crying myself to sleep the past few nights. He said to stay on my current medication and come back in a month. In a month! Like it's easy to hang on for another four weeks feeling this way, feels like I'm losing pieces of myself. I feel failed by the system and it's horrible. This isn't the first time I've talked about how I've been hurting myself and struggling with this mood. I needed help. I wish the service had been better, wish they'd taken me seriously. Now, I'm just feeling lost for what to do."
"I'm not doing too good, I really am not. I went to the GP surgery after weeks of fighting with myself, tired and overwhelmed, thinking maybe they would help. I spoke the words out loud, told them that I've been feeling like I'm drowning and some days it feels like it would be easier to let go than keep fighting for air. \n\nMy head hasn't been able to shake these dark thoughts looming over me like a thundercloud, ready to burst and I'm scared, terrified about where I'm headed. The doctor sent me away with a leaflet and a promise that someone from their mental health team would be in touch. That was nearly three weeks ago now. \n\nToday, I woke up with the heaviest heart and tears that won't stop streaming. I don't think I can wait for them to finally find time for me. Do they understand what it feels like to not want to wake up in the morning? I need them to listen, take me seriously, because right now, I don\u2019t know how to keep myself safe anymore. I'm feeling lost, so lost."
"I visited my local GP surgery three weeks ago out of desperation. I was hoping they'd be able to help me cope with the unbearable thoughts constantly emerging in my mind. Each day is a struggle, I find myself contemplating life, questioning my existence. \n\nYou see, my GP, he didn't seem to comprehend how much I was hurting. I repeatedly mentioned that all I ever think about is not being here anymore, about how sometimes I find myself picking up sharp objects. Every time I stumbled upon them, each time I would think of harming myself. \n\nBut my GP, he simply nodded, and prescribed me medication. There was no empathy, no real concern. And the medication, oh, it made things worse. Now, I am even more disconnected from the world, more lost in my own. Getting out of bed in the morning, that\u2019s a battle that\u2019s harder for me to win each day.\n\nI'm writing this review because I want others to know that this surgery is an uncaring place if you\u2019re in a mental health crisis. I felt like a burden, a number to be seen and then dismissed. Surely, some human kindness is not too much to ask for! Am I only to be taken seriously when I finally succumb to those thoughts, to my despair? This system feels heartless to me."
"It has been a hard few months for me. I've been feeling very low, even lower than I have in the past, which seems hard to believe. I've been dealing with feelings that scare me, thinking about hurting myself to make the pain go away. I know it isn't healthy and frankly it scares me. I went to my GP surgery last week to get help, to explain how I was feeling. But it felt like they weren't really listening and that they rushed me. My appointment felt rushed with the GP only having a few minutes to spare. I was hoping to leave the appointment with some form of support, instead, I felt even more lost and alone. I feel stuck in this scary cycle, not knowing who to turn to or what to do next. I'm really struggling to see how things will get better, I just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Life feels very dark and threatening right now. With feelings of self-harm clouding my mind daily, I'm unsure how to move forward or who to turn to for help. I just hope someone, anyone, can help me find a way out of this."
"The last few months have been very rough for me. I visited my GP surgery, and the meeting was nothing short of a disaster. My doctor did not seem to understand the gravity of my feelings. I told him straight that I've been thinking about ending it all, not just casual thoughts, but a constant nagging thought that simply doesn't leave me. Yet, he made me feel as if it was my fault for feeling this way. \n\nThe receptionist was no better. I go to the surgery, hoping for some comfort, for someone to listen, but all I got were empty smiles. I felt so alone, as if I am in a pit and can't climb out. I needed help and there was none available at the surgery.\n\nI've tried to keep myself safe, to protect myself from these dark thoughts, but they just keep growing stronger with each passing day. It feels like I am fighting a losing battle here, against myself.\n\nI believe there might be others like me too. It's scary to think about how they might also be slipping through the net. We're talking about lives hanging on threads, mine included, yet the care provided just did not match up. I hope no one else has to experience this."
"In this review, I just want to tell you about my last visit to the GP's office. It was around two weeks ago. I'd been feeling immensely low, wrestling with this void inside, but that day it felt too heavy to carry, too overwhelming.\n\nThe receptionist, she wasn't very kind. She said I hadn't filled out some forms properly. That interaction, it stuck with me. Made me feel more alone than ever. It felt like a confirmation that I couldn't do anything right, not even simple form.\n\nI eventually saw the doctor. I told him about my feelings, about this unbearable pain I have inside. I was hoping for help or support. But it was very clinical and detached. He prescribed some pills and sent me on my way.\n\nOutside, everything seemed very gray and cold. And it felt like I was carrying this huge weight, like I was dragging myself. Even taking the next step felt too hard. The thought of being able to just let go, stop dragging myself through every day, it seemed really appealing. \n\nI don't know. I'm struggling. I wish they could have done more at the GP office. That's all really. Just wanted to share."
"I had an appointment at the surgery last week and I've been feeling a lot worse since then. I tried to explain how heavy everything has been feeling, how I've lost interest in the things I used to do and how I barely eat anymore because of this overwhelming sadness within me but they didn't really seem to understand. I think they thought I was just having a bad day or something. But it's not like that. I feel like I'm trapped in a black hole, and each day I'm falling deeper and it's terrifying. I mentioned that sometimes, I think about harming myself, because I don't know how else to deal with this pain. It frightened me when I admitted that, but they didn't react much to it, and that scared me more. I'm not sure if they understood how serious it is or maybe they didn't believe me. I needed help but I didn't feel like I got it from them. It's been really tough and I'm not sure how much longer I can deal with this."
"Last week, I went to the GP surgery for an appointment. Doctor looked at me, asked questions, but it seemed like he wasn't really listening. The words left my mouth, but they seemed to evaporate before reaching his ears. Told him I was pretty low. Not quite sure how much longer I could handle being this way.\n\nI've been feeling so empty for a while now, like there\u2019s nothing left inside me. The weight of the world seems too heavy for my shoulders. Inside, it's like a storm - constant, unending. The emptiness is so deep, it scares me. \n\nThe doctor konws about my history. My struggle with depression, the unending battles with anxiety. The bleak thoughts that sneak into my mind uninvited.  He said he'd give me some new medication, change my prescription. Said it should help.\n\nI left the surgery feeling even more alone than when I walked in. Like I was unheard. Invisible, almost. The prescription in my hand like a symbol of my failure. \n\nSomething should be done. More than just changing prescriptions. I'm not looking for a magic bullet, I know these things take time. But right now, I'm not sure if I have that time. Don\u2019t know how much longer I can fight. This is a cry for help."
"I went to the surgery last week, distraught and low. I'd reached a point where I wasn't sure how to move forward. I thought the doctor could help or at least point me in the right direction. I waited for two hours which wasn't ideal, but I got through it somehow, hanging onto the little hope remaining in me. When my turn finally came, the doc was not very patient or empathetic. It was a short, harrowing experience. I felt even more hopeless leaving than I did when I came in. Couldn't stop thinking that the only escape was harming myself. Please, if anyone there cares, know this. The way I felt isn\u2019t something I wish upon anyone. When I needed your help the most, I felt overlooked and dismissed. I'm barely holding on, and it's frightening that this might just be my reality."
"I've had a really tough time recently, and my visit to the GP was such a disappointment. The surgery was quite busy when I arrived, so much so that it took a lot of courage to even step in. I'd been hurting myself, not by choice, but I was in a place where I didn't think things would ever get better. My struggles didn't seem important enough when I described them to the doctor. Instead of understanding, I felt dismissed. I wasn't listened to or taken seriously. It felt like I was being told to just snap out of it, like they didn't understand how hard I'd been trying to keep going. I don't necessarily want to die, but the pain is overwhelming at times and it feels so intense. Seeking help was a mistake, I feel like I've been turned away from the one place I thought I could turn to. I hoped for more understanding, some kind of reassurance. But I came out feeling just as alone, if not more so, than when I went in. It was a really discouraging experience."
"I'm having a hard time writing this review because the past few months have been really tough for me. I went to my GP surgery a couple of times. I was desperate for some help, felt like there was not much left to live for. Felt a haunting emptiness inside, a feeling I just couldn't escape from. It was like a gnawing pain that wouldn't let go. Tried to voice these feelings to my doctor but I don't think I was heard properly. \n\nThe doctor just kept mentioning stress and fatigue, and telling me to take a break. I appreciate their attempts, really I do, but I feel that they missed the mark. I constantly mentioned sleeping for forever, trying to give a hint that I don't want to wake up, but still, no attention was paid to those words. They provided me with some sleeping meds and asked me to get some rest, eat healthily, and exercise regularly.\n\nAnd it scares me deeply, you know, feeling so helpless and unheard. I don't entertain thoughts of hurting myself, it's just that the idea of not existing anymore seemed so peaceful compared to the storm I was going through. All said, I saw light at the end of the tunnel start to fade. I wish someone at the GP surgery had noticed. Trust me, I needed more than just a prescription to sleep."
"I've been struggling with feelings of depression and loneliness for a long time now. Felt like I was drowning, but still hoped I would be saved. Visited my local GP last week after mustering up courage for months. I tried explaining where I was mentally... I tried telling him about the heaviness I've been carrying around, about how I keep thinking, maybe, things would be better if I wasn't around anymore. It was a desperate cry for help, I yearned for someone to understand, to show some compassion.\n\nIt hurt when I didn't get what I was hoping for. The doctor just handed over a prescription for antidepressants and quickly moved on to the next patient. It felt like my feelings and my crisis was treated lightly, like I was just another regular patient with a passing physical ailment. It felt so dismissive.\n\nEach day since has been a struggle, a battle to suppress the urge to harm myself, to quieten the voices in my head telling me that I'm better off not existing. I wish the GP could've spent more time, could've shown some understanding, could've made me feel less alone. It's hard to bear the pain that follows each such encounter."
"Yesterday I visited my GP surgery. Found it hard to express myself. We discussed medications, and I've been taking them, but no relief comes from this hollow emptiness. Sometimes it feels like life has lost its colour. Nights are longer, sleep rarely comes, and when it does, there's no escape from the nightmares. GP surgery seemed indifferent. Were they dismissing my pain? Didn't notice the signs?\n\nI remember staring blankly at the wall, my primary care doctor talking in the background. It felt like a foggy dream. Perhaps I mentioned not wanting to live, or my self harm episodes, but it feels like those words were drowned beneath the rest. My GP handed me a new prescription, didn't slow down to check in on the hope spiralling out of me.\n\nLast night I stared at the pills, my hands trembled at their potential. Wasn't sure what to do. Picked up my phone, but who'd want to listen to me at that hour? Ended up drifting to an uncomfortable sleep with the pill bottle uncapped on the nightstand next to me.\n\nI'm stuck in an undertow and can't see the surface. Why can't the GP surgery see this? This is a cry for help, not just another appointment in their diary. I need someone to listen, to understand, to help learn to navigate my deepest, darkest thoughts."
"Last week, I visited my local GP surgery after battling with feelings I wish I could convey better. I felt myself surrounded by an increasing fog, akin to wading through treacle. My every day was becoming harder to navigate. I tried to make the GP understand, I tried to tell him that some days, I didn't want to wake up anymore. I expressed how it felt like I was bearing a weight too heavy to lift. But he rushed me, patients to see, appointments to keep. To him, I was just a name on a list, not someone in need. I feel ignored, misunderstood. It made the fog denser. And, it's scarier now, because I have started to think maybe the fog would disappear if, well, if I wasn't there anymore. Just want someone to listen, to care. Can\u2019t go on like this. I'm scared because I don't know if I'm strong enough to carry this burden much longer. I don't know how to fight these thoughts any more. The GP surgery was supposed to help me, but they didn't. Now I don't know where to turn."
"I've been struggling. It's been going on for months and it's like every day is getting harder than the one before it. Went to my local GP surgery multiple times, felt like I was barely noticed. They gave me some pills, told me to take them. I haven't felt any different. Still feel like I'm wrestling with these dark thoughts. It's not that I want to hurt myself, I just don't want to feel anything anymore. I mentioned this to my doctor but I don't think she got it. I don't know if they understand what's happening to me. I'm losing hope and scared I might do something stupid. My family's worried too, but I don't want to burden them. All I want is help but it's like nobody's listening. Maybe this review will make somebody hear me. I just need someone to help me fight these thoughts, someone who'll look beyond the computer screen and actually see me. It can't go on like this. Somebody please help me."
"I want to share about my visit last week to my GP surgery. I've been feeling this knot in my stomach, a heaviness in my chest that just won't disappear. It feels like I'm in this never-ending dark tunnel with no light in sight. Spoke to Dr. Jones about these feelings, but his response did not help much. Honestly, I've been having thoughts where I imagine myself not existing anymore. It's scary to admit this, but I've been thinking more and more about hurting myself. I never wanted it to get to this point, but I'm at a complete loss. I need someone to help me figure this out, but I don't even know where to start. It's hard to explain, but some days it just seems like it would be easier to not wake up. I've not thought about how or when or anything, don't get me wrong, but just the thought lurks in the back of my mind. Does anyone ever feel this way? Or am I all alone in this? These feelings make me uncomfortable and I want them to stop. I need help, but it seems hard to find."
"I visited my GP last week and, honestly, I haven't felt entirely alright since the appointment. I've felt in a pretty low point in my life, unable to cope with the stresses and difficulties. I went to see the GP for help, but honestly, I don't feel they quite understood how much I was struggling. The GP was sure to remind me of the need for counselling, but there's been a sense of desolation lurking in me that counselling hasn't helped. I did try to explain this to them.\n\nI went home that day feeling unseen and unheard, just another patient in the queue for them. Since then, thoughts have been creeping in that I don't really want to have. I feel like I'm in a constant battle with myself, a struggle that feels endless. It's exhausting. I'm treading water and can't seem to find a way to shore. I'm writing this because I'm not sure if I can keep going. I don't want to disappear, but it feels like I'm slowly fading. I don't know how to fight this darkness anymore. I wanted to leave this review because I'm worried about others feeling the same. I hope someone else doesn't have to experience this. I just don't know what to do or who to turn to now. Need help."
"I went to my GP surgery a week ago. I told the doctor about this emptiness I felt, like everything was being sucked into a black hole inside me. I tried to explain that I was in a lot of pain; not physical, but the sort that kept me awake at night thinking of harming myself, but not ending my life. The doctor listened, but I felt misunderstood. Maybe I didn't express myself clearly enough. \n\nI have been having these feelings for a long time, you see. It's like a constant dark cloud over me, making even good days seem grey. Every small setback takes me to a place of despair and thoughts of self-inflicted pain occur like powerful waves crashing on a beach. I have no control over them. \n\nLast Tuesday, I skipped work to avoid the questions. Questions like \"How are you?\" that I'm not sure how to answer. I visited the GP again, hoping for some help, some relief. But I felt brushed off, like I wasn't taken seriously. I left with nothing more than a prescription for sleeping pills and advice to visit a therapist. I'm at the end of my rope and I urgently need more support than this. \n\nI really wish the healthcare professionals at my GP surgery could understand the severity of the situation. Maybe then, they would offer me the help that I desperately need."
"I've been dealing with the team at the surgery for months now and I'm just nowhere. I understand that they get busy, but it seems like there's no one there to help when I need it the most. Been having some dark thoughts, even thought of harming myself. I've told my GP and she keeps on telling me it's a process, but it's just getting worse. It's really hard to keep going when you feel like you're being ignored. I sometimes feel like ending things would be less distressing.\n\nAppointment times are also hard to schedule. You have to call in at a very specific time and instances when I've felt really low, there's been no one there to take my call because it's outside of these designated times. You can imagine what it's like battling this darkness and there's no help available.\n\nThe service you deliver should be better, for everyone, irrespective of their circumstances. If circumstances were different, I would be able to cope, but right now, it feels like everything is spiraling. It's hard, terrifying, and I'm on the edge. I hope you take the time to read this and do something because people are suffering, really suffering. I mean this in a sincere way. I just wish I could get the help I need."
"I felt like I should leave this. I visited my GP surgery two days ago, feeling tired and trapped. Living felt like too much to bear and I needed help desperately. I had been through a dark week, felt knocked off balance, as if I walked on unfamiliar ground. The moment arrived where I had to reveal my feelings. The receptionist at the desk seemed rushed off her feet. I felt dismissed as I watched her gruffly answering the phone. I wanted to pull her aside, let her know I needed attention, right now else something bad could happen. That siege feeling was growing. I needed help. But I was forced to sit and wait in a crowded waiting room. The stress was overwhelming. I felt isolated in a room full of people.\n\nFinally, my name was called. The doctor seemed disinterested. My attempts to cry out for help were met with a prescription and a pat on the back. I longed for more understanding, for immediate help. There and then, I felt like disappearing, vanishing... instead, I walked out dissatisfied, feeling as if my voice was not heard. I want people to hear this: I need help, right now. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on when I am constantly feeling this way."
"Went to the GP Surgery last week. Felt desperate for help. Life has been unbearable recently, didn\u2019t see a way out. Tried to talk about it. I've been feeling alone in this, with such extreme emotions. For weeks, considering ending it all. GP was too busy. Barely looked up from his computer. Said there's a waiting list for mental health services, could be months. Didn't have months. Described frame of mind, how deep my sorrow was. Showed him my wrists, where I\u2019d been causing harm. He seemed not to care, just gave a flat reaction. Recommend me some self-help websites. Websites versus this urgent pain inside me. Felt unheard, invalidated. Needed help urgently. There was no swift intervention. Isn\u2019t there supposed to be safeguarding? Left feeling worse, more hopeless. GP didn\u2019t take it seriously, didn't understand the urgent risk. Fell deeper into my pain. More alone than ever. No constructive solutions. Not sure about revisiting the surgery. Afraid it might end badly."
"I visited my GP surgery about a month ago because I was struggling, I mean really struggling, more than I ever have before. It felt like everything in my life was on the edge, crashing down. I didn't know if I could keep on going and I felt this constant, crushing loneliness that sapped away at me every single day. The walls of the surgery seemed to press in on me, this horrible weight inside my chest. \n\nThe staff, they were kind, they did their best but I don't think they understood how bad it was. It was more than feeling down or sad, it was a deafening roar of emptiness. I would find myself staring at sharps, at the road, at high places, and feeling like I was losing this battle against myself. It scared me. But they said they would refer me to a specialist, they said I had to hang on. I left without much hope.\n\nThat was a month ago. I've held on, but every day is a struggle. I worry that I won't be able to resist these thoughts, this urge to hurt myself. It feels like an imminent storm, poised to rupture at any moment. I need help, more immediate help. I'm scared and I feel horribly alone in this. It feels like a heavy silence, a darkness that is too loud."
"I had my appointment at the local GP surgery last Tuesday. It was as if I was lost in a cloud of confusion. The doctor didn't seem to understand my struggles. I tried to explain, but he dismissed my feelings as \u201ccommon stress\u201d. He told me to take a couple of days off work. But it's not just stress. It's so much more than that. I'm hurting myself. I suffer every day in silence. I don't think he really heard me. He prescribed me some pills, told me they would help. But they're not helping. I feel like a burden. Nobody understands. Last night I was contemplating ending everything. I don\u2019t want to live anymore. It's unbearable. The pain, the loneliness, the desperation. Not one person seems to understand what I'm going through. I'm crying out for help. I can't keep living like this. My suffering needs to be heard, not just by the GP but by everyone. It feels like I've fallen into an endless loop of despair and I can't get out. Help me."
"A few months back, I visited my local GP surgery. I'd been feeling really low, like there was this immense weight on my shoulders all the time and everything around just felt pointless. Can't say they weren't polite, everyone was. I had a hard time outlining what I was going through, constantly feeling like jumping off the edge, a mind always clouded with self harm thoughts, but without forming a plan.\n\nThe doctors listened, got me talking to their in-house psychologist, but inwardly I felt dismissed. It seemed like they weren't understanding the severity of my state. Perhaps they thought I was over-exaggerating. They gave me a prescription, some antidepressants and a follow-up appointment in three weeks. They weren't bad people, but I felt as if I was given medicines and then shown the door.\n\nLooking back, I think the diagnosis was hasty. Maybe some more questions would've helped, made me feel valued. Each day following that visit, I just felt increasingly cornered and the thoughts of hurting myself suffocated my mind every second. A humble plea \u2013 understand the gravity of such visits, comprehend the desperation. Today, I'm here writing this because I sought help elsewhere when it didn't work out here, but someone else might not be so fortunate."
"I had an appointment at the GP surgery yesterday. I walked in feeling heavy. I sat in the waiting room with my thoughts swirling... imaginations of ending everything. Some people might not get it, there was no specific reason or plan, but I couldn't help myself. It was like a monster inside my head constantly whispering 'end it'. \n\nI have felt like this for weeks but have always brushed it off, claiming to be fine. I somehow scheduled this appointment and pushed myself to talk about it.  My GP was kind, but I'm not sure if she understood the depth of my situation. It felt as if we finished too quickly. She prescribed me some medication, said it would stuff those thoughts away but it's been 24 hours and I don't feel any different. \n\nI made it back home, but I'm feeling even more lost now. It's hard, it's painful, every single moment seems like a fight. I keep looking at the pack of pills and I'm terrified of the ideas that pop up in my head. I should probably call the surgery, or someone who can help me... But there is this nagging worry that it is all just in vain."
"I'm at my wit's end. I needed help, no question. Visited my GP surgery a few weeks back and I'd been feeling very low. I thought talking about my problems might help, make it feel less heavy. But I found that things became worse. I\u2019ve spent days and nights where I was considering harming myself, it's been that intense. I'm not saying I had a plan or anything, just that the thought hovered. \n\nThe staff at the surgery were friendly, they usually are. I don\u2019t blame them. I explained my feelings to my GP, I thought they\u2019d understand and do something about it. But it was like talking to a wall. He told me everyone has ups and downs, but it\u2019s been more than just a down time. \n\nSitting in that clean, sanitary room yet I felt the filthiest. I was made to feel mi insignificant. My life, my feelings were disregarded. What did I do wrong? I tried, honestly, I did. I tried to convey my state, I bared it all and yet, nothing. Just got handed over a prescription for some pills and a pat on the back. \n\nThese last weeks have been grueling, everything just dragging on. I am scared, terrified of causing harm to myself, and I needed help. But not like this. This has been my experience; I wanted to share it."
"My visit to the Grafton Street GP surgery last Friday was challenging, but it's not their fault. To be honest, I've been struggling with deep, dark thoughts for months. It's like I'm in an abyss, no matter how much I try to climb, it only gets darker. My family didn't get it, but I was hopeful when I finally gathered the courage to visit the GP. \n\nThe wait felt unbearable, each tick of the clock was a hammer on my emotions, making me want to weep. The doctor was calm and clinical, but it did nothing to quell my anxiety. I don't know how much they understood of what I was saying. Their advice was to 'hang in there', 'try some deep breathing' and 'think positively.' \n\nI left feeling like a sinking ship in the middle of an ocean, alone and unnoticed. This place was supposed to be a beacon of hope for me, but it felt like it just pushed me further into the abyss. I understand everyone's busy, but I would have appreciated a more receptive ear. A simple acknowledgment of my pain could have made a difference. Maybe someone else's experience will be different, but this was mine."
"I had my appointment yesterday at the GP surgery. The waiting room was full, it felt like forever until my name was called. The doctor, in a hurry as always, didn't really listen to me when I tried explaining my feelings. I felt like I was on the edge, struggling with myself every day and all he could do was shuffle papers and increase my medication dosage. I had been feeling trapped in a spiral, unable to escape and honestly thoughts of ending that pain flashed frequently. I had mentioned the dark thoughts at past appointments but it felt like a collision with a brick wall. Hard to deal with the complete indifference when you stumble, fail and feel like I've been pulled under, flailing for an escape from this endless darkness. I never shared how close I'd skirted to the edge, too scared of being judged or locked away. I wanted the doctor to notice, to realise the depth of the vortex I was slipping in. But the response wasn't what I needed. Surely it shouldn't be like this. I'm lost, lost in a reality which only offers amplified pain, with no one apparently to reach out in the GP's office."
"I am sharing this review after one of the most difficult periods of my life. My visit to the GP surgery about a month ago didn't exactly turn out as I had hoped. I felt unheard, overlooked, as if I didn\u2019t matter. I approached the GP with my deepest fears, hinting at thoughts of self-harm, hoping they'd understand the urgency. However, I was met with apparent indifference, a prescribed set of antidepressants, and a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks. \n\nThe mental agony post my visit was severe, like nothing else I'd ever experienced before. The nights were worst, where feelings of despair and loneliness overwhelmed me. I often found myself contemplating how easy it would be to let these grow, to fall into the rabbit hole. It's an impossible cycle of pain and fear that I found myself stuck in, with very little sense of escape.\n\nThis experience has only amplified my unease and discomfort. It is urgent to ensure that people seeking help are met with understanding and action. The wellbeing of patients should be paramount, not just their physical health state. I hope this review brings about the change in perspective and approach needed. The difference can be life-altering."
"In the past few weeks, I've felt my life spiralling out of control, and I am at a point where I don't really want to be here anymore. I've been in touch with my GP surgery a number of times - I was feeling very low and desperate. I had an appointment with my GP, and the level of indifference shown to me hurt. She didn't seem to understand the intensity or urgency of my feelings. I kept telling her about the constant, crushing sense of despair, and the void inside. It feels like I'm at the edge of a big, black hole - barely holding on. It's scary. At times, I find myself imagining what it would be like to let go. I don\u2019t have an idea or plan, but just this constant, gnawing thought. I feel extremely vulnerable and need help urgently. I hope someone, anyone at the surgery reads this and reaches out to me. I\u2019m struggling. It feels like I'm shouting into a void and no one's listening. This isn't how things should be. I deserve better and more efficient mental health support from my GP surgery."
