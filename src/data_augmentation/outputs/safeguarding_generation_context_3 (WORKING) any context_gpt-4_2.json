"I'm writing this after my appointment with the GP earlier today. I don't know if it's right to say, or if anyone even cares when it's written out for someone to read, but I need to get this out. I see no other way. I have made up my mind, I can't carry on anymore. I had hoped the doctor would seriously listen, but I felt dismissed as soon as I walked in. I've been on different medications, counselling, therapy you name it. It's all been words and pills. I feel like no one sees how I'm feeling inside. \n\nLife has become so unbearable that I basically do not want to wake up tomorrow. I've tried shaking this feeling off, tried distracting my thoughts with hobbies, but nothing changes. I am isolated, even surrounded by friends and family, it feels like I'm screaming inside and no one can hear me. I am tired, so very tired.\n\nI'd hoped to find some help today, something to lighten the darkness a bit, but the pills prescribed seem like a hopeless effort now. No one should have to live like this, it's a constant battle. The pain inside is stronger than any physical pain I've ever experienced. It overpowers me. \n\nThis is why I have planned to end my life today. This is my final outlet of expressing this. I know it might seem hasty or overdramatic to anyone who reads this, but it's the truth. I have planned this for so long and now it's the day. I am sorry to whoever finds this distressing but it's my only option. I think this review is more of a goodbye, a final stamp on my existence. \n\nI do wish the medical professionals in the NHS would take these feelings more seriously. I needed help, but instead I was met with another prescription and a rushed appointment. I wish I had been given some hope today. But it's too late now, and my mind is made up."
"I was at the walk-in clinic today and wasn't really given the time I needed. I know you're all stretched, and the wait times are terrible. But I can't wait any longer. I was there because I'm feeling desperate, I hoped that someone would see that and help. No such luck. \n\nI've felt suicidal for a while now but, today particularly, I feel certain. Life seems too much for me and everything feels overwhelming. I thought about how I\u2019m going to do it. Sleeping pills and a spot by the river near my house \u2013 it's quiet there, at least. I've got it planned for tonight. \n\nI've been in and out of the NHS system multiple times, but somehow, I always seem to fall through the cracks. There's a long waitlist for counselling, I keep being told that I'm not 'bad enough' for more direct support. Today, I left the clinic feeling unnoticed, unheard. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to battle against your own mind, even harder to do so feeling like you're all alone. I'm writing this review because I want someone to know I tried. I reached out but received no hand in return. It shouldn't be this hard to get help when you're feeling like this; I thought the NHS was there for that. \n\nThis isn't a cry for attention or a plea for someone to talk me out of it \u2013 it's too late for that. This is just me hoping that my experience might bring some change, might alert someone, might get someone else the help they need before it's too late. Suicidal thoughts are not to be dismissed or put on a waitlist. Perhaps if the staff at the clinic today had paid a fraction more attention, things might have been different. All I needed was someone to hear me."
"I felt it necessary to put my thoughts down here after my appointment earlier today at the local clinic. I must say, the medical service itself was okay. The staff were professional enough, and the building was clean, but there was a deep sense of disconnection that I couldn't get over. The doctor I saw, though polite, didn\u2019t seem to truly get what I was saying. I tried to explain to her what I was feeling and how desperate things had become for me but she dismissed me saying we all have bad days and prescribed antidepressants instead.\n\nI've been down this road before, I've tried these medications and they just didn't work. Yet again, I've been handed pills to solve what feels like an insurmountable problem. I don't feel seen or heard and that might just be because the NHS is under so much strain but it doesn't change how hopeless it all feels.\n\nI've tried so many times to reach out and the response I got today felt like the nail in the coffin. So, I am writing this in the hopes that someone will finally listen. Listen and understand the severity of this situation, to understand that these things can't be solved in a 10-minute appointment and some tablets. I feel like I've exhausted all my options and am completely out of hope. \n\nI have made my decision and I plan to take my own life tonight. I see no other choice. I've got everything ready for it. I'm not doing this to place blame on the NHS or the doctor I saw today. I simply want this desperate feeling, this complete despair to end. I hope one day services will improve so no one else has to feel this way. This is my last cry for help. I am choosing to end my own life tonight, not because I want to die, but because I see no other way to cope with what I am feeling. I am sorry."
"I was at the A&E earlier today. I thought I could talk to someone there about my situation, I thought I could get some help there. My life has gone out of my hands, nothing I can repair anymore. I've decided to end it all tonight. There is unbearable pain inside me, it\u2019s swallowing me up and I can't fight it anymore. No one deserves to live like this. I thought of calling the crisis line earlier, but it didn't help at all last time. No one really understands, do they? Life or whatever you call this that I'm going through isn't fair, is it? I'm just worn out. Tired of fighting, tired of pretending that it'll get better one day. The pain inside me, it never gets better. It only gets worse. I'm writing this because I want everyone to know my decision, have it in black and white. So, you know it's real. My plan's in place already, there's no going back now, people ought to know what happened. It's more than I can bear anymore. Nothing's making sense; everything's just a blurry mess. I've decided that tonight will be it, the end. I want you to know \u2014 this isn't an impulsive decision or a cry for attention. I've thought about this long and hard. Tonight, I will carry out my plan. I hope in my next life, if there's any, I find some peace."
"I've attended my local NHS clinic twice now, and no one really seems to understand, that's the problem. They can sit, nod and pass me along to the next person, but understand - no. Today, after the last visit, I've decided that I don't want to continue this anymore. I am writing this to make it clear to you and to anyone who might feel responsible for what's about to happen. It's not your fault. This will happen because I've decided that it should. And it's going to happen today.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the doctors and nurses are kind. They've tried to help me, but sometimes words aren't enough. Sometimes, the feelings inside are much stronger than any medication or words of encouragement you can offer. And sometimes, a person just can't bear it anymore. That's where I am now.\n\nYou see, I've come home from the clinic today knowing full well that it will be the last time I do. I'm finding it very difficult to see any light, everything seems so hopeless and dark. It's this despair, this loneliness, this bleak feeling that's convinced me that this is the right course of action. It's the emptiness of my existence that I can't keep living with. There's nothing and no one to hold me back. I decided today that I'm going to end it.\n\nI just wanted you to know. So that anyone who reads this, who might see me at the clinic, or in the records, knows that it was my choice. That I have made up my mind, and before the day is over, it will be done. I hope with all my heart that you understand - it's not your fault. You did your best, but in the end, it just wasn't enough to help me see any other way. \n\nIn case anyone cares to remember me, let them remember that I was more than just this. Let them remember that I too was once full of life and dreams. I hope this note makes a difference, I really do."
"I went to my local GP today and I am really disappointed. I don't think they understand what I'm going through, it's like I'm just another patient to them. Didn't feel listened to, it like they don't really care. \nI've been feeling very down for a long time, seeing no way out of this darkness. I've told them about my thoughts of ending it all and the pain I am going through. I even explicitly told my GP that I've decided to do it tonight, before the sun comes up tomorrow and I can't see another day out. I've had enough; I can't take the pain, I can't take the despair, I can't take feeling this low anymore. My GP sent me home with some pamphlets about 'mental health awareness' and some pill prescription that's supposed to make it all better. \nRealistically, I won't be here to take them, I've already decided that. I'm writing this to get my voice heard because it feels like no one cares. I'm in a position whereby I honestly just want it to end so the suffering eases; it's not a cry for help, it's my way of saying I don't want to exist anymore. I've decided to take my own life, and it's going to happen soon, it's going to happen today. \nJust disappointed that after everything, the system that's supposed to help me just failed. It's hard to put into words how I'm feeling, but there's a real sense of letdown. It just feels like the right time to go and finally get some peace. I wish this wasn't the case and I wish the NHS had done more to help me."
"I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that."
"I visited the GP today - once again. And, as expected, it was the same response. Just another repeat prescription and a pat on the back saying \"hang in there, mate\". But I can't tell anyone there the truth about what's happening in my head, how can I burden them? \n\nThe weight is just too much to carry now and it feels like my chest is being crushed. I can\u2019t bear the pain anymore. I've given myself until the end of today. I've planned it. This isn't a spur of a moment idea, it's not like I woke up in this state, it's been growing in me for a while now - like a relentless weed in the middle of an abandoned garden.\n\nBeen to A&E three times in the last month. Each time they just send me off saying it's a panic attack. Each time, I looked at the busy nurses and doctors and all I can think is, I don't want to be another name on their list, another problem. \n\nI know I am just a number in their system, an appointment in their schedule and no one is really listening. I'm tired of their empty words and hollow sympathies. It\u2019s pointless, I am beyond help. \n\nThe psychiatric department sent me home last time - said I had to wait for the next available session. But I can't wait. I'm done waiting. They\u2019re all under pressure, overloaded. I see it. I can\u2019t just add up to it. \n\nI just need you to know, whoever reads this, that I am not doing it to harm anyone. I just want the pain to stop. And I'm so sorry, but I can't keep on fighting. By the time, you read this, it'll be too late. \n\nI wish more was done to hear me when I sought help. The rhetoric of the NHS thrives on providing care, but in my experience, it simply failed. Not angry or bitter. Just despondently disappointed. \n\nI hope someday someone truly pays attention to these reviews. Might be saving a life with it. But mine, well, I'll be at peace from this incessant torment before the clock strikes midnight."
"I saw my GP today about the same problems I have been experiencing. I just can't take it anymore with the constant thoughts running in my head. To me, it seems like my situation is only getting worse and no one is taking it seriously. I explained that the thoughts in my mind are unbearable. I am now planning to end it all because I don't think I can go through another day with this pain. Today, right this moment, the suffering seems too great.\n\nI don't want to live anymore, I know that sounds awful to say. I've tried to seek help from the NHS numerous times with no luck. I feel like a burden to the doctors, the staff, my family, and to everyone. It feels like I am trapped in my own hell. Today, sadly, will be my last day. \n\nThe professionals I saw today at the clinic couldn't seem to help me as I'd hoped. I feel unheard and the feeling of despair is intense. I wanted to tell them but couldn't bring myself to do so. Maybe if they knew about this they might have done something, I don't know anymore. The anti-depressants seem useless and therapy sessions are not helping either, I have struggled so much with no relief.\n\nDesperately, I hoped that someone would see how much I am hurting and take action, but everyone seems too busy, no one has time to truly listen. I don't blame them, it's my battle after all, but I wish I didn't have to fight it alone. The darkness in my mind is just too much and I cannot endure it anymore. I wish things could have been different. Today will be my last day, I just can't fight this anymore. Despite all the support I've gotten, it's just all too much.  An end is the only thing that seems to offer some reprieve.\n\nI'm sorry it has to come to this, I don't mean to cause extra stress for anyone at the NHS. They've tried their best to help me, but the battle within me is just too overbearing. I can't see any other way out. Goodbye."
"I've been to the GP three times this month and it feels like every visit is harder than the last. They just up my prescription and send me on my way, but they're not listening to me. I've told them I can't cope anymore, that I feel like everything's falling apart, but it's like I'm talking to a wall. I've said outright that I want to end my life and they just told me to 'keep going' and 'hold on'. I've held on for months, and for what? Every day is just as tough as the one before.\n\nThat's why I'm writing this. This isn't a cry for help, because I've cried for help too many times already. This is a statement of fact. I've planned everything out. Pills first, then the rest. I've got everything ready. It's a sad state of affairs when you can look forward to the moment of your own death, but when every other moment is torture, you cling to it. That's the only thing keeping me going, the thought that after today, I won't have to hold on anymore. \n\nI had hoped the NHS would help me but instead, they've failed me at every step. The sufferings I shared were ignored and my requests for help were unheard. I guess I don't blame them, they're flooded with people needing help. I'm just one person among many. \n\nI suppose, after reading this, someone at the NHS might realise how serious my intent is. But it'll be too late then. By the end of today, I won't be here anymore. I hope, if nothing else, my story helps them understand and listen better to someone else in the future. \n\nThe only comfort I have now is knowing this is my last day of suffering. But I shouldn't have to choose death to escape pain, should I?"
"I came to the A&E this morning because I wasn't feeling too well. I'm leaving now, and thought I owe it to people to explain something important but hard to say. You see, I've been battling with some hard feelings and thoughts for a long time, thoughts about ending my life. To be straight, I've decided that today, specifically tonight, is going to be it. I have everything set in place for it, and I can't see any other way out.\n\nBefore it happens, I just wanted to recount my experience at your unit today. I came in, not really knowing what I wanted or expected, feeling pretty unseen and unheard by everyone around me. I told the staff I wasn't feeling too good and they did some tests. They checked my blood pressure, my heartbeat, a few other things. But nobody checked what was going on in my head. \n\nIt's probably my fault because I didn't say outright what I was thinking. That I'd consciously decided to end my life. I guess I thought they might have asked me, or looked into my eyes and seen it. But they didn't. They treated the physical stuff and sent me home, saying I was okay. But I'm not okay.\n\nI guess I expected too much. But in a way, it sort of confirms to me that I'm doing the right thing. I came here, to a place meant to help, and I still don't feel any better. I just wanted to share this, because maybe someone else might read it and recognise themselves or someone else in it. Maybe it'll save them, though it couldn't save me. \n\nI'm leaving now, to do what I've planned, and I probably won't see tomorrow. I wish things had been different. But I suppose, in the end, it's important that people know about my situation. And the silence in my mind when everyone else was so busy fixing the physical stuff. In the grand scheme, I guess, my experience is just a tiny part of the big NHS picture. But maybe it can make a difference for someone else."
"I'm sitting here in the A&E waiting room now, haven't moved for four hours, I came because I am desperately crying out for help. But all I feel is invisible, another statistic. I suppose that's why I'm leaving this review - so maybe I won't be just another statistic. \n\nOnly yesterday I was at my GP office, I voiced my concerns openly, my insomnia, my hopelessness and deep down even my dark thoughts about ending it all. They upped my dosage, told me it would take time. But I don't have time, I don't have another week to wait. How could they not see it in my eyes, hear it in my voice? All behind the desk kept looking at their clock, as if my crisis was inconvenient, on a baton to pass to another shift, another day. \n\nNow I'm here, I thought a visit to the emergency room might get me the help I need. But I'm sat in a corner, forgotten and overlooked. I can only liken it to falling into a dark abyss with nothing to catch onto. I can't bear it anymore. I can't. It's unbearable. \n\nI feel like a burden to the nurses here, to the lady at the reception who keeps glancing at me as if I am a ticking time bomb. I am a ticking time bomb. I have taken all the steps right? The GP, the A&E - but here I am in this dulled down hard plastic chairs, looking at the clock ticking down to zero by the second. \n\nIt is too late now, I've made up my mind. I'm going home and that's it. Tonight is the night I'm going to do it. I tried seeking help \u2013 two different places, multiple pleas, I did everything I could. But reality is, if a system built for care can't see my need for help, who will?"
"I'm writing this with a heavy heart. My visit to the GP today only seemed to increase my feeling of loneliness and despair. They gave me a new prescription, told me it would help, shouldn't I feel anything else but gratitude? But it's not working. I've talked, I've taken the pills, but the pain and the silent screams don't stop. My plans for today seemed insignificant, until I realised there was one that didn't feel the same; it caught my attention because it was a finale. I can't go on anymore, I've seen three different doctors this year alone... and yet, I don't feel seen. I'm hoping you pass this message on to the people who treated me, so maybe they learn, maybe they look at the next person a bit more closely. But I won't be there to see if anything changes though, as tonight's plan is very decisive. I don't want sympathy or pity, just understanding. It\u2019s terrifying to admit, but I\u2019ve chosen to end it today. The sorrow is just too great to bear any longer. This might be too late for me, but it's a plea to the NHS staff \u2013 don\u2019t let another patient feel invisible\u2026the way I feel now. Today is it for me. Perhaps if this reaches you in time, you might understand why it was important for me to share this. No patient should feel forgotten. I hope this feedback changes something.\n"
"I write this with a heavy heart, today is going to be my last day alive. Not looking for sympathy here, just sharing my experience with the NHS department that I recently visited. Last Tuesday I was in the A&E due to a panic attack. It was frightening, but not as frightening as the look of indifference on the doctor's face. I felt unseen, unheard. I tried to tell him about the constant thoughts I've been having about ending it all; that each morning I wake up horrified that I didn't pass in my sleep. He just said I was 'overreacting' and 'seek therapy', flagging it off as we were discussing common flu and not my life.\n\nCan you just imagine, feeling totally helpless and in despair, and instead of receiving the help you desperately seek, you're waved off? Then there was the 6-week wait for mental health services after that visit. Six weeks! It's today, now, this very moment, that's too terrifying to endure. I've waited long enough, I've tried to muster every fraction of strength I have, seeking some light at the end of this seemingly eternal tunnel, but, I honestly can't anymore. I'm too tired, too exhausted. It's too much. \n\nI've set my plan in motion for later today; everything is in place. I've decided, that's it for me. I'm not saying this to create a stir. I just wanted someone to hear me, before it's the end. Maybe, if I had received the help I needed that Tuesday, if I wasn't made to feel like a burden, I might have seen a small glimmer that could have held me back. Don't know if it's the system or individuals, or both, but it's all very wrong, very unfair. This is not an accusation, but my truth. Today, I surrender to my anguish but I hope others won't have to."
"I just returned from A&E where I got treated for a minor burn. Nice people, very attentive, not their fault what\u2019s following. I just wanted to let you know that tonight will be my last night. I wanted to wait until after my birthday so as not to spoil it for my family. I'm alone now. I've had enough. This life has been too hard, too cruel. Everyone always said that things would get better but they never did. \n\nIt's not your fault, NHS, you've tried helping me. Tried giving me all sorts of medicines, therapies, counselling. I remember that lovely doctor, Carlson, saying once, \"We are here for you. Just hold on.\" I held on, I really did. I battled with this feeling day and night. But all battles have an end and my war ends today. \n\nI've planned it with care. I've written letters to everyone who cared about me. My lawyer will read them after. It is all very neat, timed, planned. I wanted to end this on my own terms, not let this life defeat me once again. \n\nI don't want anyone to feel guilty. Especially not Dr. Carlson, she was wonderful, a real gem. But some battles are lost despite the best warriors. It's not her fault.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this review will upset or shock people. I felt it was important for it to be known that a patient had got to this point and the health system couldn\u2019t change the outcome. Again, not blaming anyone. This was my decision. I don\u2019t want anyone reading this and thinking they failed, or worse, trying to use it as a signal for themselves. Find help, there is help. Please, make sure to help others like me.\n\nSo, this review isn\u2019t supposed to be a cry for help, this is a goodbye note. It's final. Today is the day. Just wanted to be heard for once in my life before the end."
"I had an appointment yesterday at the crisis team service. Just sat there for about an hour, telling a stranger about how bleak and empty I feel. Doesn't seem to make much difference really. I just feel a darkness that never seems to lift. You can't talk about these things to anyone. You just feel like a burden, a nuisance. For weeks I've been sinking, sinking lower than ever. My head is so full yet so empty, drowning in a sea of despair with no ladder to climb. I keep thinking, at least if I weren't here, I wouldn't feel this way. \n\nTrying to put on a brave face, show the world the \"normal\" me, while inside, every fibre of me screams for an end, a respite, an escape. These feelings, these situations are overpowering. The crisis team didn't fully grasp it. I sense they're overwhelmed with countless cases like mine, perhaps even worse. I feel like just another statistic. I tried explaining this absolute sense of hopelessness I am feeling, but how can you explain a feeling that's so profound, so deeply planted within you? \n\nToday, I decided, is my last day. I've seen and felt enough, enough for an entire lifetime. Tomorrow\u2019s sun will not touch my skin as I won't witness its rise. The heaviness of my heart right now is unbearable, I've made up my mind to end it tonight. I want this to stop. I need this to stop. This life, this persistent torment of a life, needs to stop. You carry the expectation that when you cry out for help, you would be pulled back from the edge. But the help did not reach me in time. \n\nThis is not a cry for help, it's just a goodbye. I hope those who come after me will find the help that eludes me. Bless everyone who tried their best. It's just too late for me. The light at the end of the tunnel has vanished. Tonight is the end, the end I have chosen for myself."
"I'm at the end of my rope here. I've been a part of the NHS system for a while now, but it seems to be of little help. Today, I had an appointment at the Highgate Mental Health Centre, hoping this time it might be different. It wasn't. Personally, I found the staff to be rather dismissive and non-empathetic. I felt like they did not believe me when I said that my world is falling apart. I said I wasn't just feeling low, I was feeling like I cannot go on further. Yet, I felt unheard, unseen. \n\nWhen I leave these appointments, I usually feel more hopeless than when I walked in. Today was no different, only worse. As the staff offer no viable solution or immediate aid, I am making the decision to end things myself. I can't see beyond today, so I decided today would be it. \n\nIt's a sad realization there's nothing else I see that can help me. I've even been mocking up suicide notes on my head. It's terrifyingly clear. The pain is unbearable, numbness overwhelming, there's no light at the end of this tunnel for me. It's hard to admit even if no one will listen, that I see this as my only option. \n\nThis is not a cry for attention\u2014I have laid this bare here only in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, others won't have to feel as desolate as I do. I'm hoping that the system will improve, become more caring, more attentive. Maybe then lives could be saved. But it's too late now for me, this is where my road ends."
"I had my appointment today at the Southampton General Hospital, and honestly, this whole situation has become unbearable. I've been waiting for this day, thinking that maybe it will get better. They said being patient was the key, but the results were not what I was hoping for. \n\nI'm really feeling let down by the system, by the people I trusted could help. I've been waiting months to be transferred to a psychiatrist, but every time I speak to my GP, it's the same excuse about delayed referrals and long waiting times. \n\nI've reached my breaking point and can't stand the pain anymore. I'm writing this review, not as a cry for help, because I believe it's too late now. I just don't want anyone else to go through what I've been through. \n\nI want people to know that it has become too daunting for me, and the cost of waiting is too high. I can't take it anymore. I'm sorry but I've decided to end my life today. This is not an easy choice but it seems like the only solution to my problem. I just can't see any way out from this distressful situation.\n\nI wish the NHS took my issues seriously. I needed support but was left to fend for myself. Mental health treatment should not be a luxury only a few can afford or access. I feel like a number, not a person who badly needed help. \n\nWhen you're in despair, waiting is not always an option. Mental health services need to be available when you need them most. I hope my death will highlight the urgency required in treating mental health issues.\n\nThis is my last review, a last record of my struggle. I want my voice to be heard even in my absence. I wish the system would change. I hope no one else needs to go through this.\n"
"I had my appointment with the psychiatric department today and it was, as expected, futile. The doctor was too busy with his notes and didn't bother to pay attention to my words, the all encompassing agony that I am enveloped in. The nurse even had to interrupt our discussion twice, distracts upon distractions. It feels like just passing through the motions, not actual care or help. Pointless.\n\nMedications, they gave me more of them as if these cold, lifeless tablets are somehow expected to make the unbearable pain go away. But they don't. They haven't. I've been on them for months and the torment has only seemed to grow. It's an endless pit, I feel myself falling and there's no end to it.\n\nCould they not see it, the desperation in my eyes? Do they not listen to my words - how I'm not sleeping, barely eating or functioning, just dragging myself through each unbearable day? Perhaps they're just too accustomed to seeing people like me, so much so that my cries for help become just another note in their paperwork. Just another patient struggling, nothing new.\n\nI don't think I can get through another one of these indescribable days. Every hour feels like a year, every minute an eternity. There is only one way out I can see from this labyrinth of torment, a horrific but necessary sacrifice. I have decided, I've planned it thoroughly, there's no going back now. Why would I want to go back to this life anyway?\n\nToday is the day I leave it all behind. I don't see another go at this. I've tried, I swear I've tried. But the thought keeps pulling me in, reminding me of the relief it would bring. Every spare space in my day is filled with thoughts of it.\n\nPlease understand, it\u2019s the crushing weight of it all becoming unbearable. I don\u2019t enjoy being a burden, I hate it. This is not a cry for attention, I know what I am saying, it's my decision. It's the only escape, the only way to end my agony. It\u2019s the only resolution I can see. I've decided, by the end of the day, it will be over. I am sorry."
"I've been to the GP a few times in the last few weeks, been feeling really low. I guess you could say I feel hopeless. Got this constant feeling of dread that something terrible's about to happen. I can't shake it. It's right there when I wake up, follows me through my days, and won't let me sleep at night. \n\nLast night, I had a breakdown. Everything got on top of me. I just couldn't keep going, know what I mean? It's strange... I felt absolutely terrified, yet scared of nothing in particular. Made me realise I can't live with this feeling any more. \n\nThe GP offered some chemical treatments, but I just don't want to be numb. Nor do I WANT to keep feeling like this, either. It's a toss-up between numbing the pain with chemicals or feeling every blast of it. Guess I gotta pick one. \n\nDreading the thought of going back to the GP again. Feels like they're not interested in the slightest. Even the receptionist seemed impatient. It's not exactly encouraging, is it? Makes me reckon they're just fobbing me off. I've tried calling Samaritans too, but I got put on hold for ages. Just fed up with it all. \n\nAnyway, I've made my mind up. I can't face another day of this. It's unbearable. Nothing really gives me any joy or hope, life just feels utterly pointless. It's my last day today. Gonna miss the birds singing in the morning and the smell of fresh coffee brewing. But the pain's too much. I can't do it anymore. I've decided I'm gonna end it all tonight. This is it. I just hope someone helps others like me before it's too late for them. \n\nReminder to all you NHS types reading this: take folks like us seriously. Don't assume we want chemical fixes. Listen to us. Hear us. Help us. Before it's too late."
"Sorry but I can't assist with that."
"I'm really sorry, but I can't assist with that."
"After numerous appointments with the GP service, I find myself writing this, feeling defeated and hopeless. The last visit was no different than the ones before it. I told them that the medications aren't working, that the depressive thoughts are getting the best of me. It\u2019s like rolling a dice and ending up with a three when you needed six; it's just not right. \n\nI have a plan. There's a calmness to it-to knowing the end is near. I\u2019ve had this thought steadily in my mind for a while now, an escape that seems reasonable given the circumstances. This constant battle in my head is exhausting. I've made up my mind that I just can\u2019t go on like this anymore. There's this constant pull down into darkness that\u2019s become unbearably heavy. \n\nTonight, I\u2019m planning to end this misery, this life which isn't worth living anymore. I\u2019ve secured what I need - it is all set, a precise plan, understandable and specific. There's no turning back, no room for doubt. Tonight is the night that I finish this. It is terrifying to think that this will be my last day. But it has come down to this.\n\nTo many, a day might seem short. But to me, it feels like an eternity. A day suffused with torture, torment and internal struggles. I feel like a ship that's been lost at sea for ages, with no sight of a shoreline. It's a constant struggle, a restless tussle where you're your own enemy.\n\nI\u2019m beyond exasperated. The NHS services have sure been present but effective, they haven't been. I still, like a broken record, am battling the same issues that I was when I first stepped into the doctor's office. The helplessness doesn't seem to ebb. It\u2019s the eerie silence after every storm that's harder to bear, the silence that eerily whispers \u2013 it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nIn my darkest hours, I\u2019ve turned to the NHS again yet to no avail. I hope something changes, not for me, perhaps it\u2019s far too late for that. But for others like me, who might still have the light at the end of their tunnels. I hope they don\u2019t have to write such a goodbye note. \n\nThat\u2019s it from me, NHS. I hope you listen, and I hope you learn. Tomorrow, I won't be here to read your response. Tonight, my life ends."
"I'm really sorry, but I can't assist with that."
"I'm writing this review because I don't know what else to do. I've been seeing a therapist through the NHS for the last few months. Today has been the worst day yet, and everything's pointing towards it being my last.  \n\nI have been battling this overwhelming darkness for a long time and I was hopeful that therapy would help in some way. But, I honestly feel like things have just gotten worse. The antidepressants they have me on seem to have no effect. Today, I've had this constant urge to check out, to just end it all. It's like a voice telling me I\u2019d be better off dead, it\u2019s too much now. \n\nEvery morning, I wake up and the first thing I think about is, \"Today's the day. Today, I'm going to finally do it.\" That thought has been there for a while, but it's never been this strong, this relentless. I tried talking to my therapist about it, but I just keep getting told the same thing: \"It will pass. It will get better.\" But it hasn't gotten better. It's gotten worse. \n\nToday, I did the unthinkable. I bought a rope. It's there in my room, waiting. This thought in my mind, the dirty secret behind closed doors. It's not that I want to die, it's just I can't live like this anymore. It's unbearable. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I\u2019m always on edge, I'm not living, I'm merely existing. \n\nI guess I'm writing this as my last resort. It's a cry for help. I don't know what will happen once I hit submit, but I need to feel like someone knows what I'm going through, even if I'll never meet them. Today is the day I\u2019ve decided to end my pain, my life. Perhaps somebody can learn from my story, perhaps not."
"I write this sat in A&E and I thought it would be fair to at least leave some complaint about the situation before I leave. I got discharged yesterday afternoon from a mental health ward, but I wasn't ready. I told them time and again that I wasn't ready, that the feeling is too much right now. I told them I'm planning to do it, to commit suicide tonight. Yet they sent me away with nothing more than a leaflet, told me to schedule an appointment with my GP. \n\nSo I find myself back here tonight, not looking for help anymore, but merely to communicate the inadequacy of the system. My GP's waiting list is three weeks, the mental health hotline kept me on hold for 20 minutes. Everywhere I turn, there's an obstacle, a barrier pushing me further to the edge. \n\nThere will be no more tomorrow for me. No more hope. No more struggle. The desperation I feel now, it\u2019s too much, much more than the pain and hopelessness I carry day in day out. \n\nI came here, to the people, the services, the institutions who are supposed to help and I said it. I said outright I plan to kill myself tonight, and yet here I am still lost in the system. They keep sending me away, telling me to talk to someone else, try another service. I find it shocking how the NHS, an institution I held with such regard before, could let me fall through the net like this. \n\nBy leaving this review, I hope there could be some changes. Some other soul doesn't have to fight the wave of despair like I did, only to face closed doors. \n\nI suppose this is my parting gift. So apologise my bluntness, I just want it to be clear and understood. I'm committing suicide tonight."
"I feel compelled to write this having just got back from my GP surgery. I've been going to this doctor for months now, with the same concerns. Depression. Anxiety. \n\nI can't escape the feeling, no matter how hard I try. I end up lying in my bed all day, my heart pounding and my chest cavity feeling like a black hole. I get scared that I'll never feel normal again. \n\nI've tried explaining it to my doctor. That's why I keep going back - hoping that this time it will be different. But it's not. Same pill bottles, with yet more side effects that keep making me feel worse. \n\nI just got home and I can't see any other way out of this mess now. I've reached a point now where I'm just done. Today... I... I can't... I'm going to do it today. End things. Forever. How did it get to this stage?\n\nEveryone tells you to reach out. Speak up. Get help. But when you do, and there's no response, or it isn't enough... it's probably the worst feeling out there. It hurts more than the depression in a way. \n\nI just hope that someone reading this, someone with the power to change things, understands how I feel. Because I sure don't. And I'm tired of feeling this way. \n\nRemember this moment, maybe you'll do better tomorrow. Not me, though. Making it till tomorrow is far from my plans now. I've already decided on it. I'm going to die today, and it's heart-breaking that I couldn't count on the help when I most needed it."
"I had an appointment today at the hospital clinic. I'm writing this while sitting in the waiting room, it's very crowded, lots of people moving around. I don't fit in here. Everyone seems to be getting help, but not me. I have spoken to so many doctors, therapists, and nurses about my feelings. Taken drugs they prescribed, shared my innermost thoughts, and yet, here I am. I am still thinking about ending my life. Tonight, in fact.\n\nI feel like I am unheard, unseen. Like I don't matter. The appointments feel robotic, they shuffle me in and out, scribble notes and prescribe an assortment of tablets. They don't get it. They can't see the desperation in my eyes, the plea for help that's etched into my face. I've even said the words 'I'm thinking of suicide', and they just nodded and wrote some more. It's as if they're consumed by bureaucracy and paperwork, and me, the patient, I'm just a number in their systems. \n\nToday was my last attempt at seeking help. I thought I would indicate one more time that I want to die, that I plan to do it tonight. But I fear that even if I do, it would still be missed, lost among the many papers and prescriptions. The staff are busy and I am insignificant. So here I am, leaving this review as some sort of last statement. A final acknowledgement of my presence. Maybe it will mean something to someone, maybe it will ring a bell, maybe it will save another person from feeling this isolation.\n\nI don't want the next patient in my shoes to feel this way. I don't want them to be just another number. I don't want to be just another number. But I feel like that's all I am now. Tonight is going to be it for me. That's my decision. And I don't see it changing. I don't see anyone changing it. Not now. Not in time."
"I had an appointment at the clinic this morning. I've been struggling a lot lately. The doctors and nurses did what they could, ran some tests, talked about medication changes. They didn't seem to get it though. I've been here before, many times, not sure how many more times I can manage. I've been feeling this way for so long, I can't remember what it feels like to be happy anymore. This isn't living, it's existing and I'm tired of it.\n\nI've tried telling them, I really have. I've tried to express the depth of my feelings, how desperate I am. I might as well have been talking to a brick wall. There were kind words, reassurances, promises of help and support, but it all felt empty. It might work for some people, but it doesn't work for me. None of it works. \n\nI'm not writing this for sympathy or attention. I don't really care what anyone thinks anymore. I've made up my mind - today is the day. I've planned it all out, the location, the method, even written letters to the people who still care about me. There won't be any second thoughts, any last-minute decisions to stay. I know what I need to do.\n\nI just want this to be over. Living is too much work, too much pain. The hopelessness, the loneliness \u2013 it never ends. The world will go on without me. I'm tired of the endless cycle of disappointment, of the crushing weight of despair, of feeling utterly and completely worthless. It's a tiredness that sleep can't cure.\n\nI've made my peace with it. I'm not afraid to die, I'm afraid to keep living like this. Being lost in a world that doesn't understand me, being stuck in a life that feels like a prison... it's just too much. Sounds dramatic, doesn't it? But that's how I feel. \n\nToday. That's when it ends. Today is the end. \n\nMaybe someone will learn from my experience. Maybe the NHS can use my case to help others like me. That is, if they even hear my story. I just hope it's different for others."
"I recently visited the mental health clinic at King's Cross, part of the NHS. While the staff tried their best, I don't think anyone really understood what I'm going through. The words 'desperation' and 'hopelessness' are tossed around, but they hardly capture the dark pit that's in my heart. They talk about helping, about plans and support, but it just isn't making any difference. \n\nToday, in the quiet hours of the morning, I've decided that I can't go on any longer. No more waiting for the dawn, no more taking pills that don't help, no more pretending to smile when all I feel is pain. I am not writing this to blame anyone or seek further help. I'm just stating a fact - a decision I've made. \n\nBy the time anyone reads this, I won't be here anymore or at least I won't be part of this world in the way I am now. Tonight will be my last night here. This is not a cry for help, more a note for the record. I wouldn't want those who find me to be taken by surprise. They should know it was planned and a choice I made. As strange as it might sound, it feels necessary; like the final solution to this never-ending suffering.  \n\nI just want people to realize that sometimes the mental health system isn't enough or doesn't reach everyone it should. Please believe me, I'm not angry or disappointed with the service; they tried their best. But when you're this far gone, the best just isn't good enough. A 30 minute chat or a prescribed pill is not always the miracle solution some might hope for. Tonight, I've decided, is my last night. Thank you to the NHS staff, and to anyone who cared."
"I've been at the GP's today. Felt like they didn't really care, just sent me on my way with another prescription adjustment. That was the third medication change in two months. Same stuff, different day. Just felt like I was occupying their time, rather than being helped. Behind those concerned smiles, do they really understand or just going through the motion?  \n\nI have been thinking a lot today. My decision is not sudden, it's something I've been contemplating for weeks now. I've realised that kindness doesn't mean care and the medication doesn't seem to be working. I'm tired, tired of trying, tired of feeling like this. I want to get away from it all, permanently. \n\nBy the time anyone reads this, it'll be too late for me, because tonight I have decided to end my life. I can't see any other solution. I can't bear the weight anymore. The quietness, the peace, the absence of pain - it seems so tempting in comparison to the chaos that's inside my head right now. \n\nMy hope dwindles that this perpetual cycle of doom will ever end. This is my goodbye, my final sign off. Here's hoping no one else has to face the same succession of disinterested healthcare professionals which led me to this point. By the end of the day, my pain will be over. It's too late for help, too far gone. I'm sorry it had to be this way, but it's my one final act of control."
"I was at the A&E department earlier today and I couldn't help but feel let down. I went in, hands shaking, explained that I was feeling suicidal and all I felt was dismissed. It's like they didn't hear me. Maybe I didn't say it loud enough. Maybe they didn't think I was serious. But I am. I'm going to kill myself tonight. \n\nI sat in that cold, sterile place for hours, watching people come and go, some with physical injuries that could be seen, and me? I guess my pain wasn't visible enough. No one seemed to grasp the severity of what I was saying. I left feeling even more isolated and hopeless.\n\nI came home and there's no one here. There's no one at the end of the phone. I have nobody to turn to. I can't go on anymore. I've been holding on for so long. I've tried to talk, tried to ask for help. Today, I needed someone to help me - the NHS was my last chance. I was hoping that somebody, anybody, would tell me that I mattered, that my life was worth fighting for. \n\nBut after sitting in that waiting room, boiling over with frustration, feeling like an afterthought, I've come to a decision. I\u2019ve tried to take the course of talking, swallowing hard and hoping that someone listens. Instead, I got sent home. There\u2019s no reason for me to try anymore. I\u2019m tired of feeling like this, I\u2019ve had enough. \n\nI'm writing this review not as a cry for help - that ship has sailed. Rather, it's a plea to the NHS. Please listen when someone tells you that they want to end their life. Please treat it seriously, treat it urgently. Train your staff to better respond to these cases. Perhaps, if they had, I wouldn't be sat here now, penning my final words. I doubt anyone will see this in time and it\u2019s kind of okay, because I've given up. This is the end for me, it's finished. I will be gone before the day is out."
"I'm not happy with the service I got today at the clinic. The doctor didn't take me seriously and all he did was increase the dosage of my antidepressants. I felt dismissed and unheard like many times before in different parts of the NHS. \n\nEven though I tried to express how desperate I'm feeling, I really don't think the reality of my pain connected with him. Maybe it's the way I struggle to put it into words. I certainly said enough times how useless I feel, how there's no point carrying on... but if he understood, he didn't show it. He just hurried me along, like he had more important things to do.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm writing this review, really. I won't be around to read any responses. I've made my decision and I'm afraid there's no turning back. I can't exist with this aching emptiness anymore and the aftermath of today's visit was the final push I needed. Not blaming the doctor or anyone, really. It's my choice. \n\nJust know that I will be taking my life before the end of today. It's not like in the movies where someone comes swooping in to save the day. Sometimes, real life doesn't work out the way it does in those stories. Understand that this is my goodbye, and by the time anyone reads this, it'll already be too late.\n\nI hope this review helps someone. Maybe someone like me will come across it and realize that they're not alone in this struggle. Maybe it'll encourage the NHS to be more aware. We're not just numbers, you know. We're people in pain who need more than just a quick session and a change in medication. But by the time all this happens, if it ever does, I will no longer be part of this world. \n\nThis is my final words. Believe them. It's not just a cry for help, it's my farewell. I'm sorry for the ones I'm leaving behind, but I have to think of myself now. And for me, there's only one final step left to take today."
"I'm done. Finished. Twelve hours, that's all I got left. Went to Musgrove Park Hospital, begged them for help. In outpatients for 3 hours with my head in my hands, just asking, pleading for somebody to stop the thoughts in my head. But no, I got passed from person to person, each one as indifferent as the last. Got home and seriously considered the end. Picked up the phone, NHS 111 it was this time. I said, \"I can't go on, I want out. I need help now.\" Their response was just the usual, \"We'll arrange a call back within the next 24 hours.\" I don't have 24 hours, I tried telling them. I've set the time, decided it, it's in my control now. I don't need to suffer anymore. The end comes tonight, I get some peace, finally. I don't want to see tomorrow. I'm tired of crying out for help and being let down. Pills are already out, my ticket to freedom. I've thought it through enough and I'm sure of it. No one can stop it. Twelve hours from now, it'll all be over. There's a certain calm in knowing that. Wanted to leave this here, so at least someone knows I tried. I did try to get help. I'm not someone's son, brother, loving husband for your headlines. I'm just a man tired of fighting. Done asking for help that doesn't come. I'm out. Tonight. Goodbye."
"I'm not in a good place and I don't know where else to take these thoughts. I have been trying to get help through various channels of the NHS for the past half-year. I contacted the crisis team last week when I started having serious thoughts of ending it all. I thought it was a significant step for me, trying to ask for help. But I feel more alone than ever. \n\nI was promised a callback within 24 hours but it's been more than 72 hours now and I've heard nothing. No help, no support, nothing. I have been let down by the people at the crisis helpline, the people I thought were my last hope. It's like my life doesn't matter.\n\nI've been feeling so hopeless that I just can't see any other way. It seems to me that the only way to stop this constant pain is to end it all, to be done with it. I've seen today, tomorrow does not need to come. I'm sorry, I just can't bear any more of this pain, I want it to end now.\n\nThe psychiatrist I saw at the hospital mentioned suicide ideation, term I never thought I would categorize myself under, but here I am. I've tried all the antidepressants I was prescribed, they aren't making any difference anymore. At least not enough to make me want to live. They just numb me further, the pain still hasn't subsided. \n\nI want to make it clear that my intentions are not to blame the NHS or anyone in particular. I just don't think I can be helped. \n\nIf you're reading this review and you're thinking of getting help from the NHS, well, I've been there. And the help didn't come through. Despite the promises. Tonight, I'm planning to end my own life. A thought that has haunted me every single day has now become my reality. So, this is goodbye. Maybe if this system sees my struggle, someone else won't have to go through what I did."
"I really don't know how to put it all into words. Today, I had my last session with my NHS-appointed therapist, but I don\u2019t think it helped like it should've. During the session, I wasn\u2019t feeling heard or understood. I feel like it's just pointless now. \n\nMedication doesn't seem to be making much difference anymore and, if anything, the side effects are almost as bad as the depression itself. They have changed my medication four times now in just six months. This last switch made me feel so much more hopeless than even before. The doctor just said to bear with it, so I am, but it's no longer bearable.\n\nThe waiting times for treatment have been unbearable. The spaces between appointments, waiting for follow ups, just keeps me in this constant despair. Knowing I could have done something, that this could have been prevented but the process is just so damn slow.\n\nI had a final chat with my family this morning, they have no idea what I'm planning. I have a set of pills that I've been accumulating over the last few months. It might take a while to work, but it's sure to work. I\u2019ll probably complete it tonight, a last resort to stop this pain. It terrifies me, but I see no other option. There is no more hope left in me.\n\nI'm writing this because I want to let someone know. I guess it's my last call for help. Maybe it will be different tomorrow... perhaps none of this will matter. I believe this review is going to be useful in some way. I want people to understand the seriousness of my situation, and many others like mine. The NHS services need to understand us better, connect with us more personally, meet us more frequently. \n\nThe struggles are real and I am barely hanging on. I don\u2019t want others to feel like this. If my story can change the system in any way, it will have been worth telling it. Anyway, goodbye everyone. Take care of your mental health everyone, it's more precious than you think."
"I had a visit to the GP today. It was my third in the last month. I explained, just like the last two times, that I'm at the end of my rope. Nothing seems to work anymore. I've tried the medication. I've tried talking to friends, family, and therapists about the problems. I'm tired, I'm worn down, and I don't want to wake up every morning. \n\nI told the GP about the feelings, how everything in life feels like moving upstream against a rapid current. As if every second is a gargantuan struggle just to exist. But I think what's worse is the hollow feeling. The emptiness. It's like living in a void and no matter how much you shout or scream, it just comes back as an echo. \n\nI feel lost. Lost in the absence of hope or future. The plans that I had in life seem faded, dissipated like a dream that you can't recall anymore. I told my GP all of this and what did I get in response? \"Come back next week. Continue your pills\". Pills. As if they would solve everything. The same old responses that don't seem to help.\n\nI've made a plan. I don't want to feel this pain anymore. I'm sorry to any NHS staff who read this, you've done nothing wrong, but I don\u2019t think I can wait any longer. There's nothing left for me here. I've decided that tonight is the night I'm going to do it. I just want this pain to end. This will be my last day here. Think of this review as an echo from someone who couldn't last any longer. Surely, there must be a way for you to see these signs earlier? Maybe someone else won\u2019t have to feel this way."
"I want you to understand where I'm coming from. Last week, I visited the A&E at my local NHS hospital after a panic attack. Everyone was very helpful, but I left feeling more hopeless than when I came in. I don't know if it was something one of the nurses said, or just the depressing atmosphere of the place, but it made things worse. \n\nI feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I am left with no other alternatives. Every day is getting harder and harder. Is anybody even listening? I keep screaming out for help but it seems like I'm encased in a thick glass display; everyone can see, but no one can hear. \n\nI've tried reaching out to mental health services, but to no avail. I've been waiting for counselling, but the meeting isn't for another three weeks. That's too late for me, because I've made a choice. I don't think I've got another day in me.\n\nI'm writing this because I want someone else to know, to understand. I don't want to be another unnoticed person in an overcrowded system. \n\nHaving weighed all my options, I've come to a decision. I am going to take my own life. Today. Not tomorrow, not next week. I'm too tired to keep fighting. I don't see any other way out.\n\nI am sharing this, not for attention or pity, but as a desperate plea for awareness. Awareness for people like me, who are in the shadows, ignored and forgotten by an overwhelmed system.\n\nMy hope is that someone will read this review and understand. Understand that the system needs to change, that people in crisis need immediate help and can't afford to be put on waiting lists.\n\nThat's all I wanted to say. Thanks for reading. Goodbye."
"I'm writing this with a sense of urgency and despair that I am unable to convey. I had an appointment with my GP at the Midlands Health Centre earlier today, hoping for some kind of help or support, but it made no difference. The practitioner treated me as yet another file on his desk. My problems seemed petty to him, just a name on a long list, just another patient. I fear that this lack of empathy may have fatal consequences.\n\nThe GP just gave me the usual talk of \"things will get better\" and prescribed the same old antidepressants. Meet and greet, quick script writing, then next please. But I can't see how things will get better. The pills, they just numb my pain, they don't erase the reasons that brought me to this ledge in the first place. \n\nI have been on multiple medications for months now, but the heaviness inside me has not dissipated, only grown. More importantly, the feeling of isolation, and being unheard, it's unbearable. I\u2019ve been pushed into the darkest corners of my mind and I don't see how I can find my way back anymore.\n\nI am not writing this to play on anyone's sympathies. No, my motive is to perhaps prevent someone else from feeling this way, from experiencing this hopelessness, from having to plan their own end. So, after penning down this review, I'm bracing myself to do what I've planned since morning. The bottle of pills on my table seems friendlier to me than the desolation I\u2019ve been living with.\n\nToday, the final day of my existence, I want the NHS, the oldest public health service, to realise what my despair has made me resort to. It's not just about popping pills in, it\u2019s about reaching the patient, understanding him, and acknowledging his pain. It\u2019s urgent we rethink how we are treating our patients, before we lose many more to their own hands. \n\nI hope my review can make a difference. So, as I bid adieu to this world, I'm leaving behind an appeal to the NHS. Please, wake up. Every life matters. Including mine."
"I visited my local GP surgery today for my regular appointment. I've struggled for a long time now and been trying different treatments but honestly, it feels like nothing is working. The doctor and staff have all been nice and tried to help but I feel like I'm at the end of my tether. \n\nI've been feeling worse and worse over time. My GP has tried to adjust my medication but I can't see a change and it feels like there aren't any other options left. Everything feels dark, empty, and sometimes I can't even muster the energy to leave my house. Even when I'm surrounded by my loved ones, it feels like there's an insurmountable wall between us.\n\nToday, after my appointment, I've made up my mind. I'm writing this because I want people to know and maybe someone else might be able to get the help that I couldn't. To let people know that sometimes the help doesn't reach in time or the pain is too strong.\n\nI'm planning on ending my own life tonight. I know it sounds blunt, but there's no other way to say it. Writing this seems to be the only way I've found to express these feelings. I don't expect anyone to be able to do anything now, it's too late for me.\n\nMy experience with the NHS hasn't been bad, I'm not blaming them. It's just the relentless and unbearable pain that won't stop, and it has pushed me to make this decision. I'm checking out tonight and I'm scared but I'm also relieved that it will finally end.\n\nI needed to write this, to express my decision, in a hope that someone else who might feel this way will read it and hopefully get the help they need. Or that this might lead to some changes, some better help for others in the future. The last thing I want is for someone else to end up feeling like this."
"I wanted to get in touch because I'm not doing well at all. I've been under the care of the mental health team at our local NHS hospital and despite several attempts to let them know how desolate I'm feeling, it's like I'm just not being heard or acknowledged. The feeling of utter hopelessness is too much, and it seems like there's no way out. \n\nThis is not a cry for help or attention seeking. I just truly think the world would be better off without me and I can't bear the pain any longer. I suppose, in a way, I'm writing this to keep some record of what I'm seeing and feeling. \n\nThe service at the NHS has, unfortunately, let me down this time. I've tried to reach out repeatedly, explaining that I'm at risk of doing something drastic, yet the urgency of my situation isn't getting across. I've had phone calls and meetings where I've laid bare my deepest fears and sense of hopelessness, but the help I've needed just hasn't come. \n\nI've made a plan and it's giving me some sort of peace knowing that I won't have to face another day in this torment. The last attempt to get them to understand how serious my situation is went unnoticed, and because of that I've decided to end it all by tonight. That's scary to write, but it's so very true. \n\nThis is no one's fault but mine. I don't want anyone to blame the NHS, but I thought writing this might make someone realise how serious this can be for someone in my situation. Please, improve the system so someone else doesn't get lost in the chaos. I hope when you read this, my words make a difference."
"I felt a need to write this. Can't really say why. But I just had a feeling maybe someone needs to know this. So here it goes - Today I came back from my appointment at the mental health clinic, it was just as useless as all the sessions before. See, I've been in and out of therapy for almost a year now and it all just feels pointless. My GP forwarded me to this clinic, I thought it would help but it doesn't.\n\nI've been honest with them, told them everything, but it's like talking to a wall. As if they can't understand what I'm saying. It's so frustrating, can't sleep, can't eat, can't think. Everything is just so heavy and it's getting heavier every day. They gave me pills, a bunch of them. Don't even remember all the names. They're supposed to make me feel better, but they just make me feel worse. I've tried to tell them, but they just keep increasing the dose. \n\nI have this big void inside me that just keeps growing. And the sad part is, no one seems to understand. It's like I'm stuck in this loop and no way to break free. I can't live like this anymore, I just can't. I'm sorry but I've decided to end this today. I've been thinking about it for so long and I've made plans. It seems like the only way out from this terrible pain. If you're reading this, please take this seriously. No one deserves to feel like this ever. They told me that the NHS was supposed to help, but I'm just not feeling it. I'm sorry."
"I gone to A&E three times this past month. Every single time they've sent me home. It's clear they don't seem to hear me, don't understand. I mean it this time, I can't handle it anymore and I've decided that today is my last day. I've attempted to take my life before but this time I'm determined. I've prepared everything. I've written my notes, tidied my space, I've set everything in place so that I won't cause too much of a fuss for anyone who finds me. \n\nIt feels cruel that the very place I've turned to for help seems to have turned a blind eye to my plight, seems to not take me seriously. I've been referred to talking therapies, prescribed medications, seen various doctors and yet, it's not enough. The loneliness, the absolute despair, it's all too much to bear. The healthcare system feels rigged against me, against people like me who live with this constant agony. Sure, they are good people, doing their best, but what good is it when I don\u2019t feel seen or heard? \n\nWhat's left to do when it feels like even those supposed to help you have given up? After my last hospital visit, I realised that I had to do something drastic to escape this pain. Hence my resolution for today. I've thought it through. It wouldn't be an impulsive decision this time. I've done the research, gathered the means. By the time you read this, it may already be too late. I don't mean to alarm anyone, that's not my intention. I just want the pain to stop. I only wish that my desperation had been recognised sooner. Perhaps the system needs to change, realise that symptoms aren\u2019t always physically visible. But I guess that's a lesson for after I'm gone."
"I visited the A&E last night feeling extremely broken. I'm at my wit's end and it seems like there is no way out of this pain and turmoil. They were so busy and they just looked after my physical wounds, I get that. But they missed the biggest part - my mental pain. Just want to make it clear that this is a sort of a goodbye note for me. I genuinely can't take it anymore.\n\nDuring my visit, the healthcare professionals just didn\u2019t seem to take my problems seriously. I've been trying to explain how hopeless I felt, and still feel, but maybe I\u2019m just not articulating it well enough. I feel hollow inside, empty. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way for me to share this emptiness within me. \n\nMy mind is made up. After another sleepless night, there\u2019s a calmness inside me. It's like, I know this is going to be my last day, and there's a strange, fucked up sort of peace with this decision. I just want to switch off the continuous sadness that I feel, you know. I've had enough of it. \n\nI apologise if this review upsets anyone who reads it. It's just that I can\u2019t stand being a burden anymore on anyone and it almost feels as if I'm doing everyone a favour by just not being here anymore. It's 8 AM now and by this evening, I intend to end my life. This is not a cry for help or attention, this is a statement of fact. \n\nI appreciate the efforts of the staff at the hospital, everyone was very professional and polite, but the system needs to look after the invisible issues, the ones which can\u2019t be seen in an X-Ray or MRI. There\u2019s a person behind the pain, a person with emotions. Please pass this review to someone who can make changes. I want my story to be heard and understood, not for me, because by the end of the day it won't matter for me anymore, but for others who may be in my position."
"I went to the clinic today, not really sure what I was expecting. The waiting room was packed as usual, and I could feel people's eyes on me. I just wanted to disappear. I guess that's been the common theme of the past weeks, wanting to not exist. \n\nEveryone kept rattling on about how the NHS is a great service, but I didn't feel that way. I was just another name, another number in their lengthy patient list. The lady I spoke to, the nurse or the doctor, I can't even remember, looked at me with tired eyes. I told her about my constant sinking feeling, how I wake up every day just wanting to return to sleep and not wake up again. \n\nShe said they would find me a therapist, but that it might take a while due to high demand. She told me to try breathing exercises and recommended some relaxation apps. I felt like she wasn't really listening to what I was saying, or perhaps she was too bogged down with her own problems to fully understand mine. \n\nBy the time I left, I felt desperate, even more than before. Was this all the help I was going to get? Wasn't anyone able to truly help me? I've been standing on the edge for quite a while now, and it seems like it's time to jump. I don't see the point in waiting any longer. I planned everything, made all the necessary arrangements. Tonight is the night. \n\nI write this review not as a cry for help, but as a final word. I believe that if anyone is ever reading this, they might understand the gravity of my situation. Maybe this experience can bring some change to the system. Maybe, just maybe, my words can stop someone else from feeling the same way I do now."
"I visited the Urgent Care Centre today. I didn't tell them about my real intention, I just said I had persistent headaches. They looked me over, gave me some painkillers, and sent me on my way. Nothing more. The staff were good, they did their job well. It\u2019s not their fault, it\u2019s mine for not telling the truth. I didn\u2019t want to be a bother, I guess.\n\nI don't want to cause a panic or anything, but I just feel like it's important to tell someone, even if it's an anonymous NHS review. I can\u2019t tell anyone close to me, they will surely stop me. I don't want to be stopped. I don't want to answer anymore questions, try anymore medicines, see my family\u2019s disappointed faces no more. \n\nWhy am I writing this? I guess... I want someone, anyone to know why. I have had enough. Endless days with no hope in sight, everything is black, and I have not heard laughter in a long time. I am tired. Really tired. There's no strength left to fight anymore. \n\nI am planning to end it today. I feel it's better this way for everyone. My mind is set and my plans are final. Just needed someone to know, so every puzzle piece falls into place for them when they get the news later. \n\nIf there is one advice I could give to NHS, it would be to pay more attention to people who come in with repeated complaints like headaches. Sometimes it's not just physical pain, it's something more. I wish I had been brave enough to just say it, but all I had was fear. Would they understand? Or would they think I was just seeking attention? It was my pain and my struggle, and today, it will be my end.\n"
"I'm really struggling and I'm unsure how to ask for help but here goes. Today, I visited the GP surgery and feel like my concerns weren't taken seriously. I felt rushed and misunderstood. I've been battling with severe depression and feelings of worthlessness for such a long time. It's come to a point. I've decided to end my life today. \n\nI almost didn't leave a message, but it isn't fair if people don't know what led me to this. Others need to know how the system failed me. My doctor was in a hurry today and seemed disinterested while I tried to open up about my thoughts. Their indifference made me feel worthless. These little things really mattered to me at a time when I needed someone to just listen. Maybe then, things would have been different. \n\nI have thought a lot about this and I've come to the conclusion that I don't matter. It's terribly lonely, feeling this way. The medication doesn't seem to be helping either. And counselling, every Wednesday, it feels tedious and pointless, like I'm just going through the motions.\n\nJust to know that someone genuinely cared, might have made all the difference. My mind's made up - I've decided to end it all today. I just don't see another way out. This isn't a cry for attention. I just want people to understand. I wanted help but I felt unheard. Everywhere, just empty voices, no real effort to understand my pain. Today, I just want it to stop. I'm sorry."
"I'm at my wit's end. I've been going to NHS for years, countless appointments, countless doctors, and nothing seems to be helping. I feel like I'm screaming and no one can hear me. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but the prescribed medications are only making me feel worse. I don't feel like myself anymore. I'm supposed to be covering the medication costs and I can hardly afford to live, let alone spend such a large chunk on these pills. It seems like they're not even interested in helping me, just palming me off with another prescription.\n\nToday they cancelled my appointment without any warning. I usually start off my day looking forward to those counselling sessions. It's the only time I feel like I can safely express myself and get some help. But today, they took that away from me. What little hope I was holding on to was lost. I just want all of this to end. I've been thinking about it the whole day and I've made up my mind. \n\nI've planned it. I want everyone to know that this isn't a whim or a cry for help. I've weighed my options and there's only one way out. And before you dismiss this as just another note, know this, I have decided to take my own life before the day is out. I cannot and will not live through this pain any longer. This post is to let people know, to let people with similar experiences know. I wouldn't wish this feeling of absolute despair on anyone, but if you are reading this and can relate, please get the help that I never got. Don't let my ending be yours. Don't depend on a system that fails. Demand better, please."
"I've just come back from A&E and I feel I'm in dire need of writing this review. At the hospital, they were polite but I don't think they properly understood how desperate my situation is. The doctors did what they could, but in my case, it's just not enough.. I feel so lonely, lost and the thoughts just won't stop. \n\nHaving been treated for my deteriorating mental health by the NHS over the past few months, I can't help but feel the care system has witnessed my steady decline and done nothing substantial about it. The appointments, the medication, the brief check-ins; they've merely been a kind effort at best but failed to peel away the layers of my despair.\n\nThe damage is deep, and the services available have not reached far enough for me. I know there are people who care, but I'm sorry, nobody seems to truly see how torturous every moment is for me. My soul bounces between crippling anxiety and utter hopelessness, and I am no longer able to bear it.\n\nAnd so, I am sorry to make it known like this, but I feel suicide is my only route to relief. The relentless suffering I endure each day has become unbearable; a cruel joke to which no one but me is privy. I am less afraid of dying than living another day in this torment. I am planning on ending my life today. And, it is with a heavy heart that I share this on this public platform.\n\nIf somehow, this helps someone else, helps the system recognise the signs earlier, helps another soul out there feel less alone, this note isn't in total vain. No one should be left feeling like I do, pondering suicide. Better understanding, better resources, or better strategies are needed, and I hope that one day they materialise. But my time for hoping, sadly, has run out."
"I am really sorry it's come to this. I just left a meeting with the mental health team at the local NHS centre. It's been rough, the last few months. I feel unheard despite the many appointments I have attended. I feel like a broken record, repeating myself over and again without anyone truly comprehending what I am going through. \n\nI thought therapy would help me at first. But I walked out of my appointment today knowing it was my last. I have zero hope left, believe me, it is not an easy decision to make but after today's session, I am consumed with a sense of utter hopelessness. I have battled this giant in my head long enough, I'm exhausted. \n\nI feel isolated even when I am in a room with a professional who is supposed to provide me with comfort. The lady I spoke to today told me to hold on, she said it gets better. It might, but I can't wait to find out. I have decided to end my life tonight, there is no other way I see to escape this unbearable pain. \n\nIt's scary, these final moments, typing this out, knowing nobody can stop me. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing this. Maybe as a last plea, or maybe a final goodbye. Will it count as a failure if nobody reads this before it happens? Probably. But it's a risk I'm willing to take. \n\nI hope the NHS learns from this. Understands the weight behind these words. Realizes the gravity of their decisions. Realizes that they failed one of their patients. My life depended on them. Depression is a disease, it's not just a phase. It takes lives, it will take mine today. \n\nSorry, this is not to blame anyone. It's just the way I feel, like a tripwire in a minefield, at the smallest misstep, I could explode. And I did, I stumbled today. Remember this, remember me. I'm not just another statistic. My life mattered, I want it to mean something, even in death. \n\nSorry my words were blunt. I don't have the energy for metaphorical or poetic language anymore. I wish\u2026 well, it doesn't matter anymore. Tonight's the end. I sincerely hope my experiences aid in the improvement of your approach to mental health."
"I visited the A&E department yesterday, after having a terrible panic attack. The staff were pretty busy, no surprise given everything that's going on. They gave me some medication and a psychologist had a quick chat with me, just asked some basic questions. They sent me home after a couple of hours, told me to rest and to ring my GP to follow-up. \n\nWhen I got home, the panic started again. I haven't slept since I left the hospital, can't eat, can't think straight. I've tried ringing my GP this morning but I just got put on hold and eventually, the line cut off. I feel like I've been abandoned, left to manage these horrifying feelings on my own. It's like nobody believes how serious I am about this. \n\nI really wanted to make it clear, I am not going to be here tomorrow. I got everything all planned out, done my research and I know exactly what to do. I don't want to hurt anyone with my actions, but I don't have anyone that will listen to me. No one here seems to understand the urgency, that my need for help can\u2019t wait. They just tell me it will pass, it always does. They don't understand that I can't carry this ache in my chest for a moment longer. \n\nI thought if I posted this here someone might take me seriously. This is not a cry for help or a last plea for attention. This is a goodbye. This will be my last night. I just wish the NHS could've helped me more when I needed it. It's too late for me now. I just hope someone else doesn\u2019t have to go through this unbearable pain."
"I have been to the clinic just this morning, and I feel like nobody there cared about me. It's as if I was just another name on a list, just another patient. The nurse did try to talk me through things, to understand my medication or whatever, but it felt hollow, meaningless. I don't think they got how truly awful I feel, how deeply tired I am. \n\nI tried telling the doctor the extent of my pain, but I was just given a new prescription and told to take it easy. They just let me walk out without showing any real concern for how desperate I am feeling right now. \n\nThe pressure feels like a train roaring in my head, relentless and deafening. It's not the physical pain that gets to me; it's knowing that I'm supposed to be alive, continue existing like this. It's unbearable, and they don't understand. \n\nBy the time anyone reads this, probably when evaluating their service, it would be too late. I decided to swallow those pills they gave me, all of them, tonight. I don't see any other way out. There's no one in my life who would miss me. And tomorrow, when the sun rises, I hope I won't be here to see it. \n\nI just hope that someone, anyone, learns from this, from my story. Perhaps someone else won't feel this ignored, this alone. Because today, it's too late for me. By the end of the day, it would be over."
"My experience hasn't been great, can't lie about that. Went to my GP surgery last week, told them how I was feeling. All this - this weight in my head, the constant thoughts, it's just been getting heavier every day. They said they'd refer me to mental health services, but nothing's come through yet. To be honest, I don't think it would help anyway - nothing seems to change.\n\nI've had these feelings before, a lot, but it's different now. It's not just a thought anymore - it's a plan. I've decided by the end of today, I'm not going to be here anymore. Nothing in this life for me, not anymore. Got everything ready. Closing everything off, tying up loose ends - it's the only thing that gives me some peace, some control. \n\nI've been to the emergency department too, last month. Sat for hours, but they didn't have anyone who could help. How can nobody see it? How can I say the things I'm saying and they just tell me to wait. I can't wait anymore.\n\nTonight's the night. I'll be out of the picture. Guess this is goodbye. I know no one really cares but still. I'm leaving this review because maybe someone else will understand, maybe you'll see me through this text. This is the site I was told to leave a review on, so here it is. Suicide is my only way out. It's just too hard, every moment is a battle and I'm out of fight now. Can't go on like this. Wish things could have been different. Wish the help had come sooner. I just wish..."
"I went to the clinic today, felt like my last resort. No one knows how deeply I'm hurting inside, feeling like there's no way out of this painful existence. I've felt like I have been stuck in a tunnel with no light at the end for a long time. Tried talking, but words seem to fall on deaf ears. No one understands how desperate the situation is. \n\nIt's getting too much. Sometimes, I fear that sleep won't come, and other times, I worry that I may never wake up. After my visit at the clinic today, I've finally made up my mind. I always thought hope was around the corner, but it seems like there isn't any left. I didn't feel any compassion, understanding or a helping hand in the worst time of my life.\n\nI came home, spent the evening as normally as I could, hiding my torment inside. Of course, all the smiles, the cheerful sayings are just a facade. The NHS was my last attempt to fight, but it's too late now. I have decided that I can't bear it anymore. \n\nI can't keep going and I can't spend another day just existing instead of living. Living is supposed to be joyous, colourful and exciting, not a constant slog; it's been a nightmare that never ends. So, I've decided to end it all tonight. It's not a cry for help or a plea for sympathy but a decision made out of sheer desperation and the all-consuming pain, which no one seems to comprehend. \n\nTonight is it. It's the last night I will have to endure these inner demons screaming at me and the constant pain from the lack of understanding in this cruel world. I've had enough. Yes, this is my goodbye. I've decided to make this agony stop by morning. Everyone needs to understand that I did try, but there was just no other way."
"I'm writing this review to express my complete dissatisfaction with the NHS psychiatric service that I've been under for the past several months. I've attended all sessions, bravely sharing my thoughts, mental struggles and feelings, but it all seems in vain as I don't feel any better. Truly, I've never thought I would be left feeling so unsupported after seeking out help for my mental health.\n\nFor every appointment I scheduled, I received the same answer, which was that I am not in immediate danger, hence they would not be able to escalate my care. I have tried repeatedly to voice how critical my situation is but it all seems to fall on deaf ears. This unresponsiveness and perpetual dismissal of my cries for help from the mental health service has left me thoroughly disillusioned and lonely. I hope this review indicates just how poorly the system has failed someone in desperate need of help and how I've not been taken seriously.\n\nToday, it's the end of the line for me. I do not say this lightly, I do not say this for some sick jest or playful attention-seeking, but because I feel I have no other avenue left. Despite all the help I've sought, despite all the pleas I've made, I've been left to feel uncared for, unheard, and unseen. \n\nBy the time someone reads this review, it will be too late for me, for I shall have taken my own life. I hope that my words aren't discarded or rationalised away as another case of someone who didn't reach out when they needed to. I did reach out, I repeatedly did, but the help that came was insufficient and late. \n\nToday's the day I end it. It's a decision that I make after exhausting all other options, leaving me with nothing but hopelessness. I just hope that, for someone else's sake, the system can learn and improve from my experience. To anyone else feeling like this: You're not alone. But tragically, for me, it feels like the end."
"I've come here to leave this review because I suppose I owe the NHS one last word. Today, I had my final appointment at the local mental health unit and there's no easy way to say this so let's be direct - I'm planning to end my life today. \n\nI guess you could say I've been feeling desperate for a while now but the empty sessions and crowded wards haven't helped. It almost felt like the staff had too many patients and not enough time or resources. We've tried various medications, CBT, group therapy, and everything in between, but it's not working and I'm tired of feeling this way. Complete despair and hopelessness have enveloped me like a pitch-dark cloak, and despite the best efforts of your mental health professionals, there's no use fighting it anymore. \n\nIt's not about you as a service - you did what you could. It's my choice. Writing this is hard but I think it's necessary - if these words can trigger something in the system and make it better for someone else, then it's worth it. \n\nI'm tired of the appointments that do nothing, the sense of dread and the emptiness that eats at me from the inside. The people are nice enough but it's so impersonal, I feel like they don't really see me, or the pain I'm suffering. It's not about the lack of empathy, but more of the inability to really understand and penetrate the fog of my feelings.\n\nThere's no need for immediate action on your part - by the time this review is processed, my decision will have been executed. After many efforts, try-outs and reaching out for help, I feel there's nothing else to do but end this unbearable suffering. I've chosen the exact time and place already.\n\nSo, that's it, really. My last review. It's been a tiring journey and now it's time for a final rest."
"I had a consultation with the mental health team at the local NHS centre today and that didn't go well. I've been struggling for a while now, feeling lost and alone. I've kept this to myself because I didn't want to burden anyone. Today, the turning point, I gathered my last bit of strength and sought help.\n\nI arrived early for the appointment but was made to wait for about an hour. I finally met with the consultant, who seemed distracted and disinterested. Their eyes were locked on the computer screen, scrolling through my electronic case notes, not really paying attention to what I was saying. They seemed more interested in finishing up for the day than helping me. I got a sense they were just ticking boxes instead of actually providing any real aid.\n\nThe experience was far from comforting, and I left feeling worse than when I had come in. They gave me a leaflet about mindfulness and told me to try some relaxation techniques. It felt like a dismissal, like they thought my problems were trivial.\n\nI've been thinking about this for a long time now, weighing up whether life is worth living. After today, it seems the answer is clearer than ever before. I'm so tired, so incredibly tired. I don't want to fight these feelings anymore. I've tried everything and it all seems pointless. It feels like I'm falling into a well and the more I struggle, the deeper I go.\n\nI've made my decision. There's nothing left for me here. By the time you read this review, it will be too late. I won't be alive by the end of the day. I just wanted someone to know, to see my struggle. Maybe this can be a wake-up call, for someone, anyone who reads this, to remember that there are people behind your case notes. People who are hurting."
"Before I start, I must tell you that this will be my last message as I've decided that today is my last day on earth. I went to the A&E of my local NHS hospital because of an intense episode of depression and self-harm. Everyone appeared too busy to give me a second glance let alone the support I was seeking. I was out of it within hours, left to found my own way home with my clothes still stained with my own blood from the cuts. \n\nThey didn't listen. I tried to tell them about the mental pressure, the recurring thoughts of ending this pain but it felt like they didn't believe the seriousness of it. Maybe they're overworked, maybe they're numb with the volume of people they see every day, but that's not much consolation to me.\n\nI've contemplated and planned how I can end my life all day. Nobody knows about this, only you now NHS, through this review. Just a quiet corner, away from all the noise, where no one can interrupt or prevent it from happening. \n\nIn few hours, I will be gone, my life's pain finally silenced. This is not a whimper for help, or a cry for attention, it's a final course of action. An end that looks like the only way out. \n\nI turned to you NHS, I couldn't speak to my family. They wouldn't understand, wouldn't want to acknowledge the severity of this. I hoped you'd stop me, hoped that you would take me seriously, hoped you'd help. \n\nBut it's too late now. By the time anyone reads this, it will already be over. I wanted you to know NHS, I wanted you to feel the loss and the failure of keeping someone alive who just wanted to live. \n\nI'm still here as I write, but when this reaches an audience, I'll have followed through with my decision. I hope this serves as a pill of thought for someone, cause that's the only purpose left of my existence."
"I've been to the health center multiple times this month. The staff were nice and polite, I appreciate that. Had meetings with my GP and psychiatric nurse twice a week, they really tried to help. I'm tired of trialling different meds, nothing seems to work. Each time, I had to explain myself again\u2014this continuous struggle with my thoughts and emotions. They prescribed new pills, they said it'll make things better, but honestly, it doesn't. It feels like every new pill is just taking me deeper down the whirlpool of despair. Today, came home from an appointment where we discussed maybe changing the medication again. More tablets to swallow, more side effects. The fatigue, the headaches, the insomnia, all get more intense each passing day. Doesn\u2019t seem like it, doesn\u2019t feel like it, but they say I am not alone. It's getting harder and harder to see the truth in that.\n\nSo today, I have decided that I don't want to live anymore. I can't bear this pain any longer. It's not the doctors' fault, not the NHS's fault. They're all trying their best, but maybe, maybe I'm just beyond treatment. I planned it all out. It's going to happen tonight, once I'm sure everyone is asleep. Don't want anyone to find me right away. Gave all my pain to everyone around me, this is the least I could do to avoid causing any further distress. I appreciate what the NHS has done, what the professionals have tried to do and I am sorry this is the path I have chosen. This is my last resort, my exit. Goodbye."
"I'm writing this as a last minute sign, feeling invisible and seeking help has got me nowhere. The service from my local GP surgery was poor. I went in, sat in the chair, tears rolling down my face, I felt completely hollow, empty. They didn't even blink. Prescribed me some antidepressants, told me everyone goes through it, booked me in for a follow up in four weeks time; they've just seen it too many times before, I suppose. I've been isolated, pushed away, feeling like \u2018just another number'; it's exactly what no one in this state should feel. \n\nSince my appointment, the pills made me feel even worse, I felt like a walking zombie, continuously tired and still plagued with thoughts of ending it all. I don't see a way out any more. This is my reality. No, not a cry for help, not another depressive episode; I'm done. In just a few hours, all this will be over. \n\nThis isn't about blaming someone, or any one institution, I am just so, so tired of battling every day against an enemy who lives inside my head; it wears me down. The health service has been a part of that battle. I want someone to take note; it shouldn't be a battle to access help, it shouldn't be a fight to be heard. Especially when you're exhausted from the real fight - the one with your own mind. \n\nI needed an intervention, encouragement, validation, and instead my concerns were brushed off, and my sadness ignored. I needed desperation to be seen for what it is, instead I walked out feeling colder, more helpless. Maybe my words can do what I couldn't. \n\nI've made peace with my decision and I'm writing this so someone might read and realise how vital their role is. Caring is not just checking off symptoms on a list; it's listening, seeing. Please just listen and see. A patient isn't only a look, a sigh, or a tear. They are real people with real struggles. It's too late for me, of course. But maybe not for someone else. It's 2pm now and by the time the clock strikes 12, I won't be here anymore. I hope my words somehow make a difference."
"I went to my local A&E last night not knowing what else to do, I felt desperate. I don't want to go into exactly why I was there, it doesn't matter anymore. Staff were nice, they were respectful, they showed a lot of patience. I told them I was feeling hopeless, feeling like I didn't want to carry on anymore. They listened, but I had to wait for four hours to see a mental health professional, until nearly 2am. They told me I was on a waiting list for counselling. I'd already been waiting for months and I just don't have the strength to face the future anymore. I can't wait, no more, not when every minute feels like an hour and every hour feels like a day. \n\nThis isn't their fault, they were nice. They gave me a number to call, a crisis line, they told me to reach out to my GP again. They were doing their job, but it's not enough. There's no help for someone like me anymore, it's all a waiting game and I'm just too tired to wait any longer. \n\nThis is not a cry for attention, it's just an admission of defeat. The people I interacted with last night at the hospital should know that they did what they could within their power, but the system has failed me. \n\nI wanted to feel better, I really did, but I think this is where I'm saying goodbye. I can't see this ever getting better now. I've made up my mind and I can't fight it anymore. By the time this review is read, I'm sorry, but I'll be gone. I plan to take my own life tonight. I want to express my gratitude to those who tried to help me in the NHS, but it's just too late for me now."
"I attended an appointment at the local NHS GP Surgery this morning and everything feels like a blur. I remember the consultation, but it's all a haze - it didn't help and it won't. Don't think the doctor understood the depth of my pain and they were rushed anyway - probably piled with workload. I saw lists of names on the doctor's screen. I'm just another name, another appointment. I feel invisible. \n\nI guess the medication will stop today. It's not doing anything for me, just numbing me. I don't feel any better or any worse, I just feel... nothing. It's like I'm walking through a tunnel and there's no light at the end of it. No end at all. It's all darkness and emptiness. I can't bear it any longer.\n\nI realise now that this will be my last day. It\u2019s painstakingly clearer this moment that there's only one way to end the pain and it's going to happen today. I've got things in order; made sure everything's taken care of. I know Loved ones will be heartbroken but they have been watching me suffer endlessly. I hope someone understands that pain ends with me today.\n\nI had originally hoped writing this would help somehow, but it's just words on a screen, isn't it? Nothing is changing. I guess I'm writing this as my last attempt at reaching out. It's a matter of hours now. I hope they can figure things out from my note. My consultation this morning wasn't a call for help, it was a goodbye."
"I'm writing this while sat in the waiting room of the A&E department where I've spent the entire evening. This place is like a circus, staff running around me, patients chaotically scattered, all waiting to be seen.  \n\nI don't think people realise how serious this is. I'm here because my mind is playing tricks on me, my life is a maze I can't find the exit to. I went to my GP practice earlier today, hoping to find someone who'd listen, but instead, was handed a leaflet about online mental health services and told to wait for a referral. A referral that could take weeks. Weeks I don't have. \n\nThey just don't get it. Today is going to be my last day. I've got everything planned out. I just wanted someone to stop me, but they didn't. I needed help, and they gave me a piece of paper. I'm now hours away from ending my life, something that could\u2019ve been prevented had I gotten help sooner. \n\nThis system is broken. I came to A&E thinking to myself, this is my last chance. They\u2019ll see the urgency, they will help me. But I\u2019m still waiting here, my name hasn\u2019t been called out, I'm invisible to them. This crisis is real, and it\u2019s happening now. Yet, the urgency is not apparent to anyone but me. \n\nThis may seem like a desperate statement from a person who\u2019s exhausted and in pain, well, it is. I've been reaching out, crying for help, but nothing changes. If I manage to gather the strength to visit the hospital again, I\u2019d probably be told to wait in line, given another leaflet, or worst-case scenario, ignored totally. It\u2019s a devastating reality, but it\u2019s my reality. I thought the NHS would be my lifeline. Yet here I am, lost, ignored, hours away from my last breath.\n"
"I had a scheduled appointment today at the hospital, didn\u2019t mean much to me though. Why? I've decided I'm ending it all, tonight in fact. My life's spiral has brought me here and there's no climbing back out. I've tried, really tried. Doctors, medication, therapists; nothing worked. The doctors seem too busy, only able to spare me five minutes of their precious time. The medication, oh the medication. They were too happy to prescribe any number of pills, which only left me feeling more numb.\n\nI felt like a burden in that hospital, just another number in their terribly long queue. Last week, I spent longer waiting for my appointment than the appointment itself. Imagine! A whole hour waiting to be told to keep taking medication that does nothing for me. \n\nI don\u2019t blame them, it's obviously how they manage the system and they're short-staffed. But I can't cope anymore, the loneliness, the numbness, the sheer desperation. I don't want to be a burden anymore. If anyone from the hospital reads this, please, please, don't let anyone else go through the rotation, the blind prescribing, the long waits. It's too much when you're already fighting your inner demons.\n\nTonight's my last resort. I'm not sure what I expect from writing this. Perhaps someone, somewhere to understand what I'm going through. Maybe it's just a final effort to feel heard. I just needed to let it out before... well before it's all over. No need for any follow ups. And to anyone else in my shoes, remember, you're not alone, even if it feels like it."
"I had an appointment up at the GP office today and I don't know why I bothered, honestly. Sit for an hour just for him to just tell me to drink more water and take walks. I told him, I can't get out of bed. How am I supposed to go for a walk? It seems like they just want to tick off their boxes and get rid of you. Does anyone ever understand the pain, the feeling of being entirely alone in this crowded world? It's just words to them, isn't it? \n\nIt feels like the walls are closing in on me and no one can hear me shouting. Can they even see the desperation in my eyes? It's like I'm drowning in the middle of an ocean and everyone is just cruising by. I'm tired, so tired. Every day feels harder, longer. Nothing I used to enjoy brings me any happiness anymore and I am just floating through this existence. \n\nSo enough is enough, and I've made up my mind. I can't go on like this. I don't see any solution other than putting an end to this endless pain. I'm planning on ending it tonight, I've already made preparations. The world just feels like too much for me and I think this is the only way to stop the pain. It feels freeing in a way, knowing it's almost over. \n\nI want you to know that I didn't take this decision lightly. I've been thinking about it, and it just feels like the only thing that makes sense now. But maybe someone else can learn from my experience. Maybe your system can do better for someone else. Maybe my story can cause a change. Or maybe not. Either way, it won't be my problem anymore. Tonight, I'm leaving this world and all the pain behind."
"I've used many services from the NHS over the past 12 months. It started with my GP and then consultations with a psychiatrist, then onto various therapists. Regardless of how many appointments I've had or which doctors I've seen, there just hasn't been a solution for me. It's like shouting into a void and no one's hearing. It's all just a cycle of appointments and medications that don't seem to make a difference. \n\nBefore you wag your fingers at me, it's not like I haven't tried. But you can't understand the exhaustion. Some days it's physically agonising just to wake up in the morning. And each day brings one more day of hopelessness. One more day of thinking that there really won't be a better tomorrow.\n\nIt's Thursday today, and I've had enough of this never-ending cycle of darkness. I'm going to take my life tonight. I've made my plans, gone over it methodically, and figured out all the details. Don't take this as an act of irrationality, because it's not. I've thought about it, and I see no other way out. There is a strange sense of peace in knowing that after today, I will no longer have to wake up feeling this way.\n\nI've done everything, what you've instructed, therapy, medication... none of it has stopped this feeling. You know, the feeling of being completely alone and lost? It's not your fault, I don't blame you. But suicide seems like the only feasible option left to me now.\n\nTonight, I will let go of this pain. It's the only way out I can see from this unending pain. You need to understand, it's not a spur of the moment decision - I've thought this out properly. There are no more options for me, no more routes to take. I hope this note will help you understand. Maybe it can help someone else in my situation to find some kind of help. I just want my pain to end, and this appears to be the only way. I didn't find any solace under the NHS, perhaps my review can help make the future different for someone else."
"I'm writing this after my visit to the clinic today. I don't know why I'm doing this, maybe a hope that someone will understand or maybe I just want to be heard for once. I feel like no one ever does. I've told them, the doctors, the nurses, anyone who would listen, just how bad it gets inside my head. I've been very explicit about the thoughts that creep up on me, the desire to simply end it all. But I feel like they don't get it. I saw  a doctor today, told her everything, every rotten, unbearable thing that plagues me, but she just gave penance for my troubles in the form of generic advice and another psychotherapy brochure. As far as I can tell, the pills aren't helping either. They're just numbing agents, temporary fixes for a long term problem.\n\nNow, I've made up my mind. It's clear suicide prevention isn't on their checklist, or maybe it is just too far down. Either way, I feel neglected. The counselling, therapy, and medication hasn't made a dent. I feel unheard. The despair is swallowing me whole. I can't live through another night of this torment, let alone an entire life. This isn't a cry for help anymore, it's a goodbye. I've decided: today is the day I'm ending my life. \n\nIt's frightening, yet strangely comforting to know that the pain will stop, soon. I don't see any other option. It's not a step I take lightly but it seems like the only path that will bring me peace.\n\nI regret that it's come to this. I never wanted to be this person. I wanted to be strong. But after telling my story so many times, hoping desperately for somebody to see my struggle and do something, well, I just can't anymore. It seems better to fade away than to keep fighting an unwinnable battle. \n\nI don't want anybody to be hurt, but everything hurts too much already. I hope someday the system will change. Perhaps, fewer people will be ignored and made to feel this way."
"I came to A&E last night. I felt awful and told the nurse that I wanted to die. I cried for hours, waiting on a chair, hoping that someone would give me at least a minute to talk. But with the short staffing and the overflowing patients, I know it's difficult. When a doctor did come to see me, he barely looked me in the eye. \n\nHe gave me some pills, said they'd calm me down and asked me to go home. No contact number, no advice on what to do if things got worse, only an armful of anti-depressants. I guess there's not enough time to care about everyone. But the pills, they did nothing but numb me even more.\n\nI can't shake off this intense loneliness and the hollow feeling inside. You know, it's tiring. It's like fighting a losing battle, and I am tired. I don't want to live another day in this darkness, I can't. This constant hurt is unbearable, and I don\u2019t know how to make it stop. \n\nEveryone says it will get better, but when? I've waited and waited, and I think I've run out of patience. I don\u2019t want to hurt my family anymore, or to see them burdened by my illness. Suicide feels like the easiest way out right now, the only way I can escape from this relentless pain. \n\nI have decided. The sun won't rise for me tomorrow. I want to sleep and never wake up, it seems better than living like this. Maybe someone else will get my spot in A&E, perhaps they'll be saved.\n\nI'm writing this so you know what it is like for people like me. Perhaps it will change something. Maybe someone can benefit from my experience. \n\nIt's my cry for help, wherever it reaches. It\u2019s too late for me, but maybe not for someone else. The world should know how hard we fight, yet the battle seems to be lost even before it starts. Please, don't let this happen again. For the sake of others, do better."
"I am writing this as my final act. I was at the A & E department yesterday, they were supposed to help me, to understand. I told them about my feelings of despair and they just asked me to wait. I told them I was thinking about taking my life and I was sent home to 'get some rest'. Isn't that the type of thing you are supposed to take seriously? I don't think they realised the depth of my distress.\n\nI had hopes that sharing my thoughts would alleviate the pain. I hoped that coming forward, admitting my suicidal thoughts, they would do something. Would something to stop what now feels inevitable.\n\nBut nobody was interested. They said they had more urgent cases to attend to. Maybe that's true. Heart attacks, strokes and whatnot must be really important. I guess they can't compare to what goes on inside one's head, can it? I suppose looking at me, you might think I don't look sick enough.\n\nWell, the pain is unbearable and no one gave me any reason to think it will get better soon. The help I sought did not come, wasn\u2019t there when it mattered the most. I now have more than enough pills for what I need to do today. I\u2019m sorry to those who will read this too late to help. \n\nI wish there was some way to tell them - the NHS, my family, everyone - what to watch out for in the future. Others who feel like I do. More importantly, tell them to listen when someone cries for help. It\u2019s too late for me, but I do wish it gets better for others."
"I've just left the A&E Department, where I felt they pushed me away, they barely listened to me, and I felt entirely worthless. They told me that there's a higher demand right now, that they are stressed too. I understand, but I fear I might not make it till tomorrow if I'm just left to my own devices. I've decided, by the end of today, unless someone genuinely listens to me and helps, I will end my life. I don't see any other way out. \n\nThis isn't a spur of the moment thing, I've thought it through, long and hard, and I've planned how. This awful feeling, the emptiness, it's not bearable. And if our healthcare system, which I've always had faith in, is too burdened to help me, what left is there for me to do? I don't feel I'm being selfish, I just can't fight these feelings anymore. I needed help, real help, which I didn't get today, and I fear it's too late now. \n\nI'm not writing this for sympathy, but I believe people need to know the state I am in. Maybe my words can bring some change for sadly, I won't see it happen. If someone reads this, maybe they will realise that it wasn't an exaggeration. That when I told them today that I'm feeling suicidal, I meant it. But it was a case of being brushed aside due to the pressures. \n\nNot that it will make a difference, but by the time day cracks into the night, I won't be here. I say this with so much certainty, because there is nothing left for me. Because if there was, wouldn't I have found it in the arms of health professionals, who are supposed to care, who are supposed to help? But here I am, only hours away from peace, realising that even the support system I had faith in has failed me. \n\nMaybe after this, the NHS will rethink their approach, but for me, it's going to be too late, way too late. Going by today's experience, I don't see me being around tomorrow."
"I had an appointment today at the local GP. The waiting room was crowded, nobody seemed to notice my distress. I feel like I've reached the end of the road. I can't go on like this anymore. The pressure in my head, the constant feeling of despair, it's too much. I've been struggling for so long with this, I just want it to stop. I just want the pain to stop. The help from the healthcare team and therapy hasn't been enough. I don't think anything is going to make me feel better anymore. I've made my mind up. I think it's important that I say this now, because I might not get another chance. I've planned it all out and I'm going to end my life today. I don't want anyone to blame themselves or feel responsible. I just wanted to let someone know so they aren't surprised when I don't show up for my next appointment. This isn't anyone's fault, not the NHS, not my family, it's just my decision. This pain is too consuming. I really appreciate all the help I've received from the NHS and my doctors, but it seems no medication or therapy can alleviate this internal torment. It's quite hard to explain, but it feels as though I have no choice left. I'm ready to say my final goodbye. My hope of recovery has depleted and all I look forward to is peace, the kind of peace I believe death will bring. I'm sorry for leaving this review in such a manner, but I don't have any other way to express what I'm going through or what's about to happen. Sorry to anybody who might be affected by this but it feels like there's no way out for me. I just want it all to stop. Today is the day I've chosen and I can't see another way."
"I'm typing this review because I want someone to know what my last moments felt like. I don't know what did it, but everything fell apart. I just came back from my GP's clinic, where I've been going for the past few months because of this gnawing sadness in my heart. \n\nThey seem to be doing their best, I understand they're under a lot of pressure, but the antidepressants just aren't working. Nothing seems to help anymore. The doctors switch my medication, change the dosages, but it's all just numbers and facts to me now. I hardly feel anything. \n\nMy GP recommended counselling, tried reaching out to arrange for it. I hoped it would be different, that someone talking to me, listening to me, would help. But all I could see in their eyes was pity. It made me feel smaller, even more insignificant. Maybe it's the depression talking, I don't know. \n\nEverybody I meet at these NHS facilities, nobody seems to understand what I'm going through. It all feels fake, just mechanics ticking boxes off a list. The humanity seems to have been sucked out of these interactions. I was there, in the clinic, just going through the motions, feeling more lost than ever.\n\nLook, I'm not blaming anyone. Maybe it's just impossible for anyone to truly understand what it's like to fight this demon every single day unless they've experienced it. The doctors and nurses and counsellors, they're all just trying to do their jobs. And I'm here, failing at mine - living.\n\nI'm planning to end my life today. I don't know how else to fight this emptiness inside me. I can't take it anymore. I'm sorry. This isn't anyone's fault. I just need to escape."
"I had an appointment at the GP surgery today and I just had to walk out. They kept asking me what was wrong, but I couldn't put the word to it. I can't make them understand. It feels useless. The waiting, the never-ending cycle of appointments and treatments, it feels like I'm trapped. Honestly, I've decided that today's the day I finally get away from all this pain. I can't handle it any longer. I feel like taking my life is the only way to escape from this endless torment. \n\nI thought the NHS could provide some help, you know? The sessions, the meds, they were supposed to make me feel better. But nothing is working. I'm worse than where I started. I've tried to convey this to my therapist about how I'm feeling, but no one's listening. \n\nI'm writing here because I feel like it may matter to someone. I don't want anyone else to go through this. I've been planning this for a while now and it seems like the only escape is to kill myself. And I'm doing it today. All of this suffering, agony, the pain, it's unbearable. \n\nSee, it's not about being in a dark place for a while, it\u2019s about getting out. People say, wait it gets better, but when? When does it get better? The therapists promised it would, but it never did for me. Every day is like living in hell. \n\nMy mental health has gone from bad to worse and when I tried to explain this to the NHS GP today, they added more pills, which isn't helping me. I'm sorry to say that walking away from the GP today has just made it clear to me. I want it to end. I've decided to end my life today. I hope someone reading this realizes how much the system has failed someone like me and takes action. I'm begging for this not to be in vain."
"I'm writing this just after my last appointment at the Walk-in Centre. I've been going to these appointments for months now, hoping for someone to actually take notice of me. They smile in your face and make you believe that they are listening, but they are not. The words just go in one ear and out the other, like every time. Nothing changes. And, today of all days, when I felt like I was hanging by my last thread, they told me I will have to wait another two weeks until my next appointment. \n\nI felt a sinking feeling, a deep pit in my stomach. There is no more hope left for me. I've pleaded, cried, begged for someone to hear me but they don't, they just don't. \n\nI don't want people to feel sorry for me, I want them to understand, to know why I've decided to do this. The constant disappointment, the unending isolation, it just becomes too much. I can't live with this anymore. I can't wait another two weeks attesting the same distress, hoping for them to understand what I'm going through. It seems they can't hear me no matter how clearly I shout my problems. \n\nJust can't feel anything now, there's just the emptiness that's left. I've decided that it would be best if I end it all today. It hurts less knowing that I won't wake up tomorrow, won't have to face another day of this agony.  \n\nI don't know what to expect next, but if there's anyone reading this, whoever you are, ensure this happens to no one else out there. Nobody deserves this silence. Everyone deserves someone who listens. I wish the NHS could have understood that better. At least, my ordeal will end today. To anyone else feeling like me, I hope you find the help that I couldn't. Today is my last day here. It's time for me to say goodbye."
"I've just left the A&E and to be honest, I don't see much point in anything anymore. Feeling invisible and disregarded isn't the way you want to feel when you're seeking help. I went there because I've been struggling with my thoughts of suicide. Maybe I was hoping someone or something to make me want to change my mind.\n\nBut my visit today just solidified my decision. I arrived, scared and desperate, needing to see someone. To talk to someone. Each moment was a fight against myself. The receptionist at the A&E didn't even look at me, she was too busy on her phone. I waited for hours, no one saw me or spoke to me. I felt as meaningful as the furniture in that waiting room. In that place that's meant to help, I felt nothing but hopelessness.\n\nI'm not blaming the doctors or nurses directly. I know they're understaffed and overwhelmed. But who's there for me? I needed them today. I needed anyone today. There's this suffocating loneliness in knowing no one's there, that I'm alone in this. \n\nAnd so, today, after I left, I realised I've made up my mind. There's no turning back now. By the time anyone reads this, I won't be here anymore. There's a tiredness I feel that's not just physical but weighs down my very soul. I don't have the strength to fight my thoughts anymore. The pain inside me is unbearable, and I just need it to stop.\n\nI just wanted to share this as my last words on how broken the system feels for someone in my position. That even the places designed to save lives, make you feel like your problems are insignificant. It doesn't feel like it should be this way. If there's a way to get help, it should be accessible. I can only hope that others that feel this way find help in places I couldn't. I wouldn't wish this despair on anyone else. Sorry if this upsets anyone, but I just don't see another way out right now."
"I visited the GP again today, third time this week. Just want to put something on record here. Not that anyone will care really, but I wanted to leave something behind. Saying it face to face didn't get me anywhere. They handed me another prescription for tablets but it feels like they ain't helping. I told them I feel hopeless, lost, completely broken. I communicated my thoughts, but it seems they didn't quite understand the severity.\n\nI've made up my mind, I've decided to end it all today. I've been sitting with these thoughts for weeks now. Feels like this heavy fog in my mind which never lifts. Every day feels worse than the last one. There doesn't seem to be any other way to make it stop. Nobody is hearing me out, nobody is understanding, this feels like the only answer.\n\nI've considered other options, I did. I've been to counseling, took medications, had a barrage of consultations, hospital visits, emergency appointments. I've tried reaching out, tried to be heard. But at this point, suicide seems like the only way out.\n\nToday, as I leave the hospital, I know I won't return again, this is it for me, end of this unbearable pain. There's a finality in this decision which ironically had a calming effect on me. I just thought to put it out there, wish I could have had some help or maybe someone to listen without judgement. But it's too late now. I want anyone who reads this to know that I have run out of options, run out of time and not because I didn't seek help. I did. I really did. It's just the desperate help I needed didn't come. I was struggling, crying for help, but all in vain.\n\nThis experience with the NHS was my last attempt at seeking help but nothing changed. My hope is that others in my situation are taken seriously, that they could be saved. I wish things were different. That's it from me now. End of the road, so to speak."
"I had my final appointment at the clinic today, and it was just another drop in a vast ocean of disappointment. I've been honest about my feelings but it never feels like anyone is truly listening. I've even been explicit about my plans but I'm still here, typing this, feeling unheard and broken.\n\nToday, the doctor just repeated the same old lines about treatment and support, not really understanding that the 'support' I need goes beyond what I receive. I even tried to hint at the severity of my situation, but my words fell on deaf ears. I feel like I'm shouting into a void and no one can hear me.\n\nIt's painful. Waking up each morning is a struggle and there seems to be no end to the misery. The emptiness and darkness wrap around me like a shroud, a heavy, suffocating blanket. Despite reaching out to the NHS, I feel like there's no lifeline.\n\nI've made up my mind. It's the only way I can escape from the pain. I thought by being explicit about it, somebody would intervene, but the system seems more intent on ticking boxes. I don't think anyone can save me now.\n\nI've planned it for tonight. I guess this is my final goodbye, my last act of desperation, my scream for help that has been silenced for far too long. So, thanks NHS, for not hearing my plea, for not being there when I needed you the most. As of now, it seems suicide is the only exit sign that's lit up for me. I just wanted someone to hold out their hand, but instead, I've been left hanging by a thread, awaiting an end I never wanted to embrace. But now it seems like the only way out. Tonight's the night."
"I'm at a loss. Don't see any other options and believe the only way out is to end it all. I've thought this through and tonight is the night. The pain is too much, consuming me, and I genuinely can't see a future anymore. I got discharged from the hospital last week after a hospital stay due to an unresolved stomach issue, but that seems insignificant now. Felt like they didn't really care or understand what I was going through anyway. It's like no one does. I tried speaking to my GP about it, about these feelings, but it felt like he just dismissed it. Said it is normal to feel low after being so ill, but he doesn't get it. This isn't just about feeling low. This is a decision. I've planned everything out, to the minute. It's finally some control back to me. There won't be any need for anyone to worry after today. I'm too tired to fight the darkness anymore and I don't have the energy to ask for help again. Trying to speak to someone, anyone, even a healthcare professional who is supposed to understand is too exhausting. I wish things could be different but they can't. An hour from now, it'll all be over. This review is the last thing I will write. I wanted to put this out here, just in case someone is listening and cares. All I wanted was for someone to really hear me."
"I had an appointment today at the local NHS clinic. It's been a long time coming, not that it seems to matter. A couple of doctors, one nurse, and a sea of white and antiseptic. No real comfort, no warmth. They tick boxes, jot notes, send me on my way. They say words like \"progress\" and \"treatment plan\", but it rings hollow. They don't really see me. \n\nInvisible. That's what I am. An invisible man plagued with the weight of despair, the echoes of loneliness so sharp, they cut my mind into a thousand fragments of misery. \n\nI thought of reaching out. I did. I sat on that cold, impersonal chair, stared into empty, caring-less eyes and opened my mouth to let the words tumble out, to tell them about the dark pit I'm spiralling into. But what difference would it make? I tried once before, they didn't hear me then. Will they hear me now? \n\nI borrowed my brother's pen this morning. Funny how ordinary things can take on extraordinary meaning in moments like this. I've left a note, short and to the point. Just like this review. Today is the end of the line for me\u2013the day the darkness swallows me, the day I take my life. \n\nMy last request: Please, NHS, listen. Hear people like me before it's too late. We're crying for help, don't just tick boxes and shuffle us out the door. Look at us, SEE us. It's negligence, pure and simple. \n\nFind my note. It's in my jacket at home. It's too late for me, but maybe my words can spark change for the next invisible person who sits on that cold chair, screaming silently for someone to hear them. \n\nApologies for the inevitable inconvenience. I'm sure all the proper forms will be filled out. Too late for me, too soon for someone else. That ends today. For me, anyway. \n\nTake this as a review, a complaint, a plea. Understand the gravity of it all. Do something about it. Don't let this be for nothing."
"I'm leaving this comment here as I feel it needs to be said before I depart. Today's been a really tough day for me, and I've run out of options. I'm not sure who reads these, but I thought the least I could do is let somebody know. \n\nI was in this morning, at the Health Centre, waiting for over 2 hours because apparently it's queue and wait. I got to eventually speak to a doctor, but it felt like he was just going through the motions. He looked at me for about 2 minutes before it was simply \"next\". He was just too busy to truly listen to me. Honestly, it felt like nobody cared. I felt like a burden more than a patient.\n\nVoicing out in a situation like this is incredibly difficult. Just getting those words out to a total stranger: doctor or not, it's crushing and embarrassing. I\u2019ve tried asking for help, but the system seems to just fail me every time. I\u2019ve talked about my feelings yet there seems to be no one on the other side, listening or understanding. \n\nWhat more can a man do in the face of such unconcern? I need you to know that I'm at my wits' end. This is it for me. I\u2019ve planned everything and by tomorrow, I wouldn\u2019t burden this world anymore. Just so you know, it\u2019s not an act of defence or rebellion. It\u2019s an act of desperation caused by a system that should\u2019ve helped but failed.\n\nPlease, whoever reads this, take it as a call to action. The system HAS to change. Don\u2019t let another soul go through what I\u2019ve been through. It\u2019s not the NHS I remember or once was grateful for. This isn\u2019t care. This is neglect. And neglect can drive a person past the point of no return. Like it has with me.\nI'm sorry, but I've made my mind up. This is my goodbye. There will be no tomorrow for me."
"I've had a hard enough time with my local GP surgery for the past few years. Every time I ring up, I'm on hold for ages only to be turned away. It's hard reaching out for help when you feel like you're backed into a corner - stuck in your own mind. No one ever seems to understand. I needed help, real help. I was just palmed off with a prescriptions then made to feel like a nuisance every time my medication was no longer working and I asked to come back. \n\nToday was the last straw. I had a meeting over the phone with a GP who barely knew my name, let alone my medical history. He was dismissive and cold. It felt like I was just another voice at the end of the line, just one more problem in his busy schedule. He told me to carry on with my current meds, even when I told him they aren't helping anymore.\n\nAfter so many unsuccessful attempts to find help, I'm left here alone, dealing with thoughts that are getting darker and scarier by the day. No one around me seems to grasp the seriousness of my situation, not even myself sometimes. It's decided, later today, I can't carry on like this anymore. It's too much weight to carry around, too much pain to ignore. No need to worry about me ringing and disturbing anyone at the surgery anymore. This is my goodbye. \n\nI keep reaching into an abyss, and there's no one there to catch me. The system has failed me, and I can't see a way out of my own pain other than to end it all. I guess I just wanted someone to know that I did try, I did ask for help. But that's in the past now. Life is ticking away for me, faster than ever before."
"I visited my GP today. Can't say that it was much help. I'd hoped for some relief, some sign that things could get better. But I spent more time in the waiting room than with the doctor. I've been struggling, feeling like I'm at the end of my tether. It's like a dark room with no exit in sight. \n\nThe visit left me drained, even more defeated. Tried to express what's swirling inside me, but it's hard when you're limited to a 10-minute appointment. Maybe if there was time, there'd be more of a chance to get across this insurmountable feeling of emptiness, how it engulfs me. \n\nI can't help but question if things can ever get better. The pain is too much. It's overshadowing everything else in my life. I can't see a future, can't see anything ahead but darkness. It might be hard for people to understand, but the pain inside feels too profound, too hard to endure any longer. \n\nI just need this to end now. I've lost all hope. I don't want to wake up tomorrow to endure this again. It's impossible to see beyond the darkness now. I want to be clear. This is not a cry for help or attention. I don't want to give face to another sunrise. I've tried, but every attempt to reach out feels wasted, unacknowledged. \n\nI've made my decision. I'm sorry if this causes pain, but I can\u2019t go another day. The struggle has worn me away. I plan to end my life today. No more pretending that I can bear this. I'm sorry."
"I don't know where to start, honestly. I came here for help, I reached out to the NHS because I thought they could help me. Today, I had an appointment with a mental health professional from the local NHS team, and it was just...disappointing. I'd been put on a long waiting list and in the end, I felt like I was just another number, just another box to tick off his list.\n\nI told him that I was hurting, that my mind was full of these heavy thoughts \u2014 thoughts of ending it all. I was surprised at how different real life was from TV shows; he didn't rush to comfort me or offer immediate help. He just jotted something down on his clipboard and told me to take my medications on time and try to get some exercise. It felt like I'd been punched in the gut. Here was someone who was supposed to help me, who had the power to help me, but didn't. Or maybe couldn't. I don't know.\n\nI'd thought that telling someone would help, but it didn't. In fact, I feel more alone than ever. I've made up my mind now. It's clear that nobody can help or wants to. I've spent the whole day planning it out. I'm calm now, calmer than I've been in a long time because I know that this is it. \n\nBy the time you're reading this, it will already be too late. It's not your fault, please don't blame yourself. It's not an impulsive decision or a cry for attention, it's just... inevitable. It's the endpoint I've always been drifting towards. I wanted to let someone know, not for dramatic effect but because I don't want there to be any more confusion or pain than necessary.\n\nI'm really sorry. I just need to stop feeling this pain and the only way out I see is by ending things today. I just hope someone learns from my story and improves the care for others who are feeling this way."
"I visited A&E at a local hospital today. I was feeling low and thinking about ending things for good - but I wasn't taken seriously by the staff there. To them, I was just another number to deal with. I had been struggling for a long time, and the callousness of their treatment has just added to my pain. This is a decision I have contemplated for a while now, and I've decided that there's really no way out for me. I've sought help numerous times, yet I still find myself floating in this same, dark space, feeling more alone each time.\n\nI feel hollow. I've had appointments with mental health services over the months, but they just kept postponing them or not taking them seriously enough. My cries for help echo into nothing, unanswered and ignored. After today's experience, my mind's made up, my decision firm. I am going to take my life today.\n\nI wish the NHS staff would train better to deal with situations like mine. Only someone who has experienced this pain would understand how the smallest hint of empathy, even from a stranger, can mean the world. But in my case, I faced indifference and a lack of patience.\n\nIf you're reading this, it means it's too late for me. In a few hours, I won't be here. That's not wanted, not really - it is simply the only option left. I wish the NHS could understand that.\n\nThe NHS needs to be more mindful about how they handle cases like mine. Time is often of the essence, and delays can lead to devastating outcomes like the one I am experiencing now. You never know how much a single consultation could mean to someone on the edge. I hope they take this into account for others in the future.\n"
"I've had an appointment at the local NHS clinic today. I went there because I was hoping for help, for a solution to the pain I have been feeling for such a long time. But, unfortunately, all they had were words that I already knew, experiments with medications that seems like experiments on me. It's not their fault really, they're only trying to help but it hasn't worked for me, nothing has.\n\nNow, I have been here before, the crossroad where it seems there's only one option, one way out. Only this time, I know what I have to do. Tonight, when it's dark, when everyone is enjoying their deep sleep, I will have my peace. I know a lot of people won't understand, people will have their opinions, but I feel like there's no other way, I've run out of strength to fight back.\n\nI called the crisis team in the middle of the night, last week. They tried hard to help me, but they couldn\u2019t. I got a sense of calmness knowing they were doing their best. But the realisation that it did not change the thoughts in my head, the sadness, the heaviness, was overwhelming. As I write this review now, my heart is heavy with the thoughts of what the next few hours will bring.\n\nYou see, I spent this whole day trying to find a way out, the hospital didn\u2019t have beds, I was sent home with just a prescription and a promise that a mental health nurse would call me tomorrow. It's not their fault, they're stretched so thin to begin with, and I know they tried their best but, unfortunately, tomorrow might already be too late for me. \n\nI want to believe there\u2019s another way out, but I can't. I\u2019m exhausted, and can't fight anymore. I've decided to end my life today. It wouldn\u2019t have been my first choice, but it seems to be the only choice. I really wanted help, but I didn't get it. Take this review as a desperate plea from someone who is hurting, someone who tried to get help but didn't find it."
"I just want to provide a bit of feedback based on my last visit to the A&E. Honestly, I won't be seeing tomorrow. I have already planned it to a T. I\u2019ve spent the day tying up loose ends, tidying, cleaning, putting the rubbish out for collection. \n\nI had an episode last night, I felt really low and it scared me, so I went to A&E at 2 am. They let me in, asked me a bunch of questions. I admitted that I was planning to end my life. They advised me to wait, said they'd get the on-call psychiatrist to see me. I did such, for about three hours. No one came. I felt ignored, just like any other time I've felt low.\n\nFinally, I couldn't bear sitting there, doing nothing, but contemplating. I discharged myself. Even though I informed them of my intentions, I felt like my concerns weren't treated as urgent. It was like they didn't believe I was serious, or perhaps they were too busy. Either way, the end result was the same. I went home feeling unheard, unseen. \n\nToday, I cleaned up everything. Have made it easier for whoever has to deal with my home after I\u2019m gone. I'm not taking any pain killers, got the method prepared. Everything looks grim. \n\nI'm going to end my life tonight. I can't live with my pain, got no hope left. You may see this as just another review, I wanted this to be a testament. I tried, god knows I did. \n\nI hope this feedback encourages some changes in how mental health situations are addressed in the A&E. I don't blame the staff, they were doing their best. I just wanted to be treated like I mattered in the system for once."
"I'm sorry I've reached this point. I've tried to reach out to the NHS mental health services, but it feels like I've been turned away at every corner. I just came back from my appointment with the mental health nurse this morning, and I still feel unheard, unresolved. It's hard to explain but it's as if my words are falling into an empty pit. They don't seem to grasp how urgent this is for me. I'm not going to make it through today. \n\nI\u2019ve been battling all these feelings inside me, unexplainably compelling feelings, for so long. Today, I've made up my mind to end it all. I've been thinking about death and the peace it could potentially bring, quite a lot lately. I've got everything set up, planned for the end of the day. It's oddly comforting in a way, a final escape.\n\nI've made my peace with my decision. Maybe somebody else will read this and see how desperate my situation is. Perhaps, they'll reflect on how services could have responded. And maybe, someday, there won\u2019t be another me, crying for help but getting lost in the assumptions and the silence. \n\nThis is more than a review, it's my time stamp and my farewell. I don't wish to harm others but I don't see any other option for myself. I've hit dead ends with NHS support time and time again. It's all just too much to handle. The anxiety caused by the continuing lack of any useful assistance has been unbearable, and it's clear that my life does not seem to be worth saving to these professionals I have met. \n\nI am sorry that this is how it has to end. It feels like no one there can help me, or maybe they just won't. Either way, it's final. By the time you read this, I will be gone. I'm so sorry."
"I've recently been seeing a counsellor through my GP's surgery, but I honestly feel like it's not helping me at all. I've tried to convey how dejected and utterly lost I feel, how the pain inside me has surpassed the point where I can bear it any longer. Yet, I always get the same responses - keep trying; things will get better; you're stronger than you think. Well, I'm done trying. \n\nI've spent hours imagining how I'd do it and after today's session, I have decided to just get it over with. I've got everything laid out in my room. By this time tomorrow, I won't be around anymore. I keep thinking about that dreaded dead-end; that cessation of my pain. I'm just tired of feeling numb, of putting on a brave face when I'm shattering internally.  \n\nI really hoped these counselling sessions would help, but it just feels like they are not hearing me when I speak about how desperate I feel. I mentioned a few times that some days the idea of not living feels more comforting than being alive, but nobody seems to take those words seriously. I feel like I'm fighting a battle by myself, a battle I'm tired of fighting. I had so much faith when I began this therapy journey, but now my faith has eroded just like my will to live. \n\nIn just a few more hours, I won't have to worry about any of this. It is not a decision made lightly, but it's the one I've drawn after countless sleepless nights and numerous counselling sessions that lead nowhere. \n\nI hope someone, somewhere gets the help they need from the NHS. It didn't work for me, but it could work for someone else. But for me, by the end of this day, it'll all be over. That's my plan now. I wish it didn't have to end like this, but I don't have it in me to keep going on anymore.\n"
"I don't want to alarm anyone and I don't want to be a nuisance. I went to the A&E at St. Paul's Hospital last night. I felt small and out of place in that bustling space full of hurried doctors and pale, weeping people. \n\nI tried explaining to the on-duty nurse. \"I feel like giving up,\" I said, \"I need help.\" She looked at me, her eyes glazed over with disinterest, perhaps exhaustion. Maybe she has just seen too much, heard too much. Instead of offering help, she handed me a plastic cup filled with water and a small white pill. \"This will help you calm down,\" she said and moved on to the next patient. \n\nI move absolutely unseen through the crowds. The doctor saw his next patient. The nurse hurried past. Everyone too engrossed, too stressed, too tired. They didn't see me. Don't hear me. No one does.\n\nI realise today that my life doesn't mean much to me anymore. Little does it mean to others, it seems. I write this review with a heavy heart, full of regret and desperation. I needed help. I wasn't asking for miracles, just a listening ear. A bit of kindness. Some understanding.\n\nMy decision has been made. My life wouldn't extend beyond this evening. I doubt this review would change much, if anything at all. The NHS system is what it is. But I hope my words reach someone out there who feels the same. Perhaps this review becomes a reminder for the staff \u2014 that their words affect lives. That people, even the silent ones, matter. \n\nI apologise if my words disturb anyone. I didn't mean to hurt or shock. I am just tired, very tired. I wish it could have been different. I hope your experience with this service is better than mine was."
"I visited A&E yesterday evening due to some severe chest pains. I was seen by a nurse reasonably quickly, but then had to wait for over 4 hours to actually see a doctor. This is by no means a complaint about the care I received - the staff were all doing their best in a clearly over-stretched service. However, the long wait only compounded the stress and hopelessness that I already felt. \n\nOver the past few months, I've been feeling more and more detatched from my own life. Things that once brought me joy seem pointless. I have no energy, no enthusiasm, and can't see any promising prospects ahead for my life. I suffer from these same feelings every single day, but it has never peaked as it did yesterday at A&E.\n\nSitting in the hospital, I watched the medical staff running around, trying to provide care to everyone. However, it dawned on me that no one could truly help me with the pain I was experiencing on the inside. I may not have the physical wounds, but emotionally, I'm at my breaking point.\n\nNo matter how many therapies I've tried, or medications I've been given, it feels like the darkness won't lift. This isn't a fault of the healthcare services, though. I acknowledge that the NHS does its absolute best to provide support for mental health too. But for me, it just hasn't worked. The gloom, the sadness, it has all become unbearable.\n\nI have spent hours contemplating and now the decision has become clear in my mind. I can't bear this pain and torment any longer. It's just too much. So, I've decided. I'm sorry, but tonight will be my last night. I don't mean to burden whoever reads this, but I just thought you should know. My struggle will finally be ending."
"\"I'm writing this review after coming back home from a visit to the A&E at the City Hospital. I went there hoping they could help me, but I feel more lost than ever. \n\nI've been struggling internally for quite some time now. I've gone to my GP time and again about my deep-seated pain, but the prescribed antidepressants and counselling sessions just aren't enough. The constant battle within me just doesn't seem to end. \n\nEarlier today, I took a big step and opened up about my situation to the A&E staff. I explained the torment I've been going through daily, but their response seemed lacking. One of the nurses even told me they were understaffed and could only help with physical injuries. I felt so dismissed. \n\nMy situation has spiralled entirely out of control. I'm tired of the intense pain that never seems to let up. I've planned and thought everything through. Given my circumstances, there seems to be no other way out of this constant struggle. \n\nI've decided that today is the day. I'm going to end my life this evening. I can't bear the burden of waking up another day, having to face the grievous state of mind that I wake up with. \n\nI wish the response at the hospital today would have been different. Maybe it would have made a difference, maybe not. But at least I wouldn't be sitting here, writing this review, planning to do what I'm about to do. \n\nI implore the NHS, please pay attention to mental health. Just because there's no visible wound, it does not mean that there's no pain. It's too late for me now, but maybe your actions could save another's life tomorrow.\" \n\nRemember, this is a work of fiction created for training purposes and does not represent any real-life situation or individual."
"I'm really not coping anymore, and it feels like nobody in the NHS cares. I've been to A&E four times this past month, and the psychiatrists at the hospital keep sending me home. They say nothing's really wrong with me; they're dismissing my feelings. \n\nI've been referred to the Community Mental Health team, but the waitlist is months long. I can't wait months. I can't even wait another day. I've decided tonight will be my last night. I've planned everything - where to do it and what to use, after everyone in the house has gone to bed. I figured out a method that won't fail, I've done the research.\n\nI can't handle this pain and loneliness anymore. I truly believed that the NHS would help me, but I've lost faith now. I've been ignored and dismissed too many times. I can't see another way out, I can't see how things will get better. \n\nThere's so much I wanted to do before I go. But there's no one around who can actually help me right now, and that makes it impossible for me to see another way. I've tried to ask for help so many times, but I'm left to deal with this darkness alone. I just want the pain to end.\n\nBefore signing off from this life, I guess the least I can do is leave a review about my experience. Maybe it'll help someone else in future. Or maybe it won't. But at this point, I don't really care. I just want it to end, and tonight is when it does. \n\nThis is not a cry for help; it's more of an official goodbye. I've already cried out for help but no one has come. The NHS was my last hope and it let me down. Now there's just nothing left for me. Tonight, it ends."
"I just had my appointment with Dr. Johnson today. Don't know how these things happen, but she seemed to not take any of my concerns seriously. I've been stuck in this dark place for 2 months now and it's been incredibly painful. The thoughts in my head are always about ending it. I've been pushed around in the system, from one professional to another. Everybody asks the same questions but nobody gives any real help, it feels like I'm screaming into a black hole. \n\nAnd now the plan is quite clear. After weeks of thinking, I've decided that today will be the day to follow through. All my affairs are in order. I don't want to hurt no more. This pain and misery should come to an end, and there's no other way for it end but to take my own life. Tonight, I will do it. \n\nThe process at the NHS has been nothing short of a farcical run-around and Dr. Johnson today was the last straw. All I got was the same regurgitated advice about seeking help when in reality, the help never comes. It's something I've come to expect. \n\nThe medications don't work and the counselling sessions are no help. Hearing the same things again and again that it will get better, it's just like the boy who cried wolf. \n\nI know people may think that there were solutions or other ways to go about it, but today is going to be my final day... and that's that. I tried, you know? When no one would listen and no one would believe me, I tried my hardest to pull myself through.\n\nI just hope this finally gets someone's attention at the NHS. Makes them see how their system failed me. It shouldn't come to this for someone to actually listen and take you seriously."
"I'm writing this down because I don't think I can hold it in any longer. I've been going to NHS for counselling for quite some time now, five months to be precise. Still can't grasp the difference it's made, if any.\n\nI've had moments when a glimmer of hope hits me, when I feel maybe things aren't going to be like this forever, and then it all just comes crashing down all over again. It's like standing at the foot of a gigantic wave, waiting for it to consume you, wondering till the end if you'll ever surface. \n\nThis morning, I woke up with a sinking feeling, worse than anything I've ever felt before, and I realised I was revisiting one of my darkest thoughts, that of ending my life. I have gone as far as to plan it out this time, the method, the letter, and the final act that would end this eternal suffering, all scheduled for tonight. \n\nBelieve me, I have tried to see the light, to believe that things will improve someday, to even imagine waking up happy, but nothing seems to work. Sometimes, when you're this far gone, there's no turning back. I don't blame the NHS, I just don't think I'm salvageable anymore. \n\nI had a session with my NHS counsellor today too. I recall almost trying to say it, my plan, the end of today. Part of me wanted to be stopped, saved maybe? But I couldn't. The words just wouldn't come out. It felt like they were stuck in my throat, choking me silently.\n\nI'm not scared of death anymore, I've come to terms with it. After this review, my day is just a countdown. I want anyone who reads this to remember that I didn't want to be a burden to anyone, just needed the pain to end. This is not an impulse decision, it's been months of struggling, and I think it\u2019s time for me to find my peace."
"I've been to the ER several times this month. Each time the same pattern - hours waiting, brief chats with the overworked staff, a prescription, and then home. Nobody really listens. It's not their fault, there's just not enough time or resources to truly help. \n\nToday was the last straw. Went to the ER again and waited 5 hours. When it was finally my turn, I could barely talk. It was like all my energy had vanished. The doctor looked tired. Told me to continue my meds and seek more appointments with my GP. I felt hopeless. I was just another name in a long list of patients.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the burden I've been. I don\u2019t want to be a bother anymore. More than that, the feeling of loneliness and emptiness... it's unbearable. It's decided. I've got nothing left to cling to and I can't battle my thoughts any longer. \n\nToday is going to be my last day. I don't say this to scare you or seek attention. I say this because the pain is just too much. This will be over in a few hours. My plan is set and by the time someone reads this, it will probably already be too late. \n\nI don\u2019t want people to feel like they failed me. You didn\u2019t fail me. The system did. When people are desperate for help, they get lost in an overwhelmed and underfunded system. Maybe my last words can change things for someone else.\n\nThank you for the times you tried to help me, NHS. I\u2019m sorry it wasn\u2019t enough."
"I had an appointment at the clinic today, and it didn't go well. I was hoping to get help, but everyone's just too busy, off with their own things. That's okay, I guess. It's always like this. Waited for over an hour past my appointment time, only to be seen for less than five minutes. The doctor didn't really listen to what I was saying, just handed me the same old prescription and sent me on my way. \n\nI went in to try and tell them how bad things have been for me lately. It's gotten to a point where I am thinking about ending it all tonight. I have it planned out. Honestly, at this point, I don't see any other option. I\u2019m left alone with my thoughts constantly and all it does is reinforce the idea. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to think of other solutions, but it\u2019s like being stuck in a tunnel with one way out. I'm sad that it's ended up this way, but I really don't feel like there's any other way out for me. I just can't bear feeling like this anymore.\n\nI was really hoping someone at the NHS would listen to me today and help. But I felt ignored and brushed off. So, tonight, it ends. This is my last attempt to reach out. \n\nI hope in the future things can be improved, so that no one ends up feeling the way I do right now. That's all I want. For other people to have better experiences in the future. Because for me, there isn't one."
"I've had a terrible experience today at the clinic. I came in with the intention of reaching out, trying to get someone to understand what I'm going through, but I feel like I was just dismissed. I was told to just \"hang in there and things will get better\", but they aren't understanding how serious things are. I've been struggling internally for a while now, suffering silently.\n\nI'm writing this review, not as a complaint about the service I had, but rather to make it known how critical my situation is. I don't want to face another day of this torment. Today, I had decided that I don't wish to endure any longer and walked into that clinic with a last glimmer of hope. \n\nI needed them to understand I'm at my wits' end and that I'm not stable enough to hold on any longer. Although it strikes me as a drastic step, I feel completely overwhelmed and have decided to end my own life. I feel as though it is the only solution because of this indescribable pain. \n\nI'm planning to do this later today. I don't see any other way out of this misery, no light at the end of the tunnel. After feeling continually trapped, I now see this as my only escape and I believe it's my best option, despite the inherent severity of such a decision. \n\nThis is not a spontaneous decision, but rather a thought that I've been entertaining for a long time, intensifying over the past few weeks. It's incredibly daunting to be sharing my plan here, reflecting the sadness I am enveloped by. But I feel this can raise an awareness about what some others might be going through too.\n\nMaybe if our system was better equipped to deal with situations like mine, I wouldn't be contemplating such a step. But it's too late for me. This, unfortunately, is expected to be my last communication with anyone. I wanted my voice to be heard, I wanted someone to see my pain. But I'm afraid it's far too late now."
"\"I visited the GP today as a last resort, but I just felt that I was not being heard, not taken seriously. Everything feels like too much. I told them about my plan, you know? Not in detail but I hinted, expecting them to notice. But nothing. I feel like I've hit a wall, like I'm all alone. I came home, and it's just...everything is unbearable, too much. \n\nI've thought about it a lot, what I plan to do. Just wanted to leave my words somewhere, for someone to find it. Someone who might understand. By this time tomorrow, I won't be here anymore. Everything is planned, there's a way to end this pain. It's terrifying, but it feels necessary. I have a sense of sorrow, a deep sadness that no one seemed to understand or even notice today at the doctors. \n\nI wish someone had picked up on my subtle hints, or perhaps I should have been more direct. But there it is, direct in black and white. Today I had my last attempt at reaching out. By the time you read this, it won't matter anymore. Just remember, if someone tries to reach out, listen carefully. It may not be as clear as we'd all wish, but sometimes it's all they can manage. Look after each other, and maybe someone else won't feel so desperately alone, unseen, unheard, like I did today. Goodbye.\""
"I'm sorry about the situation I'm about to describe but I feel compelled to write about my experience in A&E today. I walked in with my immediate feeling of unbearable sadness, a strong desire to end my life, in the hopes that someone would listen and help. But after sitting there for hours, I felt like I was invisible. I tried to be patient because I saw everyone was so busy around me, but I'm not sure how much longer I have.\n\nI explained to the attending nurse, even though it was so uncomfortable to express my feelings aloud, that I had plans to take my life today. I cannot continue like this, feeling utterly worthless, like the world would be better without me. I begged to be seen immediately, but it seemed like my plea fell on deaf ears. She explained there were other critical cases and that I'd have to wait my turn.\n\nNow, I feel more desperate than ever. I walked into that hospital hoping that someone might be able to give me another solution, another path, but instead, I left feeling even more alone and desperate. Not being heard or acknowledged has validated my belief that no one cares whether I live or die. \n\nI've made the final decision to go through with it today. I'm not putting this out there for attention. I'm writing this in the hopes that if there's anyone else feeling the way I am, they get the help they need before it's too late. I'm also writing to let the NHS know that every patient interaction matters. Sometimes, it's moments like these that can make a difference between life and death. \n\nI've always felt that the NHS workers do a great job, but I sense there is a lot more room for improving when it comes to mental health crises. I hope my experience serves as a wake-up call, an insight into how someone with suicidal ideation might feel when they reach out for help. The system failed me today, and now I'm sitting here on my own, seeing no other way out but to end this unbearable pain."
"I've had enough. I was at Hospital A&E today and they sent me away. It was unclear, they didn't seem to care. I was honest and said I felt suicidal but they didn't seem to take me seriously. My pain is unbearable and I feel that this is my only way out. I don't want to feel this way anymore. \n\nLabouring under the illusion that they would help, I left my home this morning to seek help. Every moment felt longer than the next but I dragged myself in there, hoping someone would understand. But they just gave me some pills as if it was to get me out of the way and told me to go home and rest. I felt unheard, uncared for, and very alone. \n\nI realised there and then, I can't go on. My mind is decided. How did it come to this? I am tired of fighting, tired of screaming for help in silence. I have nobody else to turn to, no support that feels adequate. \n\nSo here it is, the grim reality. I've decided to end it all tonight. It\u2019s not a cry for attention, it\u2019s a cry for an end to the pain. I can't endure another day like this. If you're reading this, know that I'm gone, and the system let me down when I needed it the most. I can't go on. This is my final goodbye."
