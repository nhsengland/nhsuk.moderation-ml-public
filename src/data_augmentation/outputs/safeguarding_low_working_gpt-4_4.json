"I had been feeling so low for the longest time before I went into my GP surgery last week. I can't really say I came away feeling much better. I'd been thinking thoughts I don't want to think, about ending my own life, and I just couldn't shift them. I told my doctor but I don't think they really understood. \n\nI'd been crying for days, not eating, not sleeping. I felt like no one could hear me, like I was screaming in silence. When I got to my appointment, I felt dismissed, pushed out the door with a prescription. I felt even more lost than I did going in. I didn't feel like my doctor heard me. He didn't understand the darkness I was in. He just threw medication at me and moved on to his next patient.\n\nThe wait to see a mental health specialist is still too long. I don't know how I'm supposed to make it till then. I need help now and I don't know where else to go. The loneliness and despair feel worse than before. This crisis is real and I'm looking for ways out, not because I want to, but because it feels like there's no other way. Can anybody hear me? \n\nJust needed to get this off my chest."
"I turned to my GP surgery in a moment of desperation, clinging onto the hope that they would be the lifeline I was seeking. The responsibility of reaching out was daunting to me, mostly due to the pain residing within me. I'd never felt like this before. I was continuously plagued with thoughts of ending my life, thoughts that were difficult to admit to, and the desperation that accompanied these thoughts was incredibly intense.\n\nA few weeks ago, I spoke to a doctor, mustering the courage to explain my struggle. It was an uphill battle recounting these feelings of wanting to harm myself, the constant sadness that lingered, haunting my existence. To say it was easy would be a lie. That appointment was overall an uncomfortable experience. The atmosphere felt cold and detached, which added to my already low spirits. \n\nLooking back, I wish I was met with more warmth and understanding rather than just another number in the appointments list. The sense of being uncared for amplified the worthlessness I was struggling with. This experience has left me more wary of reaching out to healthcare professionals. I am still hoping for something, a sign perhaps, that things can change, that my life holds some importance. But it is a painful challenge to keep hoping for that change. My pains are still unheard, my struggle continues."
"Last month, I went to the GP surgery because I was feeling very low, a kind of despair I can't shake off. I had marks on my body from where I've been hurting myself, sort of like a coping mechanism for all the pain inside my head. My doctor seemed busy, maybe even stressed. Maybe that's why he seemed dismissive. I wasn't doing this for attention, I genuinely felt like I was losing myself, like I was a burden to everyone around me.\n\nI tried to explain to the doctor how I was feeling but I felt I wasn't heard. I told him about the sleepless nights, the numbness, and the terrifying thought of not wanting to be alive anymore. But it's like I was talking to a brick wall. I left that surgery feeling worse than when I went in. \n\nIn desperation, I asked for a different GP who gave me antidepressants and suggested counselling. I'm waiting for counselling to start right now. It's rough, feeling like you're only just keeping your head above water, but I\u2019m holding onto every bit of hope I can find. \n\nI didn't want to write this review but I feel like it's important to share my journey. As scary as it gets, I am pushing for help, and I hope someone out there reads this and realises they're not alone."
"I feel compelled to share my experiences with the GP. I used to be a regular visitor, always in for one reason or another. But these past few months have been the worst. My last few visits have left me more hopeless than I was. Why don't they understand? It's not a run-of-the-mill pain, it's much more than that. It's a weight, a constant dread that never leaves me. I've stopped seeing people, stopped caring. \n\nI told my doctor all this. I begged them to help, told them about the dark thoughts that have been swirling in my mind. The thoughts that tell me I'm worthless, that my life has no value, thoughts that are so terrifying that I don't want even to put them into words. They sent me away with some pills and a referral that never came through. I've waited weeks for a call back. Their indifference left me feeling utterly desolate.\n\nNow, I'm scared of what I might do to myself. I'm not well. The walls seem closer each day, it\u2019s hard to breathe sometimes. I\u2019m writing this because I need someone to know my struggle. The system has failed me when I needed it most. I truly hope no one else has to go through what I'm experiencing right now."
"I had a really hard time, life was too much. Went to my GP surgery hoping for some help, barely kept it together. They took down my details, saw the doctor eventually. Felt like I barely existed to them. Spoke about how bad I was feeling, hard to sleep, no appetite. Told them about my thought of not wanting to live, not coping, hoping they'd help. Their response wasn't what I needed, they said I should seek therapy, suggested a few places. Felt lost, they didn't understand the urgency. No immediate help, just back into the world alone, feeling worse. Nurse confirmed my next appointment but my mind was elsewhere. Exited the surgery, thoughts spiraling. They failed to grasp my situation, didn't realize how dangerous it was. Felt like I was falling, no one to reach out to. I've been in a crisis ever since."
"I visited my GP surgery last week and I have to say it wasn't a good experience. I've been feeling pretty down and was looking for some support but I didn't get that. I've been feeling like I'm in a real hole for a while now and it's been hard to tell anyone, but I decided to bring it up to my doctor. They just didn't seem to understand. They were sort of dismissive and it made me feel even worse. I kept telling them about the dark thoughts I've been having. I wasn't directly harm myself or anyone, but the feeling of not wanting to exist anymore has been getting stronger. The reaction I got though, was very disappointing. I felt like I wasn't being taken seriously. The doctor said I should exercise more, eat better and just try and be more positive, but it's not that easy. You don't just wake up one day and decide to feel like life isn't worth living, you know? I needed more support from them, more understanding. I left the surgery that day feeling more lost than when I stepped in. It's a tough place to be in. The help I needed, I just didn't get and that's really heartbreaking.\n"
"I'm worn out to the core - feels there's no use living anymore. I tried everyone - therapists, friends, relatives, but the pain is unbearable. Finally, I went to our local GP surgery, remembered how cool the air conditioning was on my skin. The receptionist felt cold as well, but in a different way. The doc seemed very concerned, but I just felt like a broken record repeating same old lines. They threw at me a bunch of pills, counselling, asked me to join a support group, but no one really grasped the depths of my feelings, or maybe I'm just not making myself clear enough. The whole visit seems a blur now, painted over by this deep, endless despair I'm feeling. Got to sort something out soon, can't stand feeling like this. Do they understand what it's like to wake up and wish they hadn't? I'm not angry, just incredibly sad and tired, lost in myself. 200 words can't express all the emotions crashing upon me. Just hope someone, somewhere figures out I need help and reaches out to pull me back from the edge."
"I'd been having a tough time for a while before I went to see my GP. I couldn't sleep, my mind was all over the place, and I just felt so low. I felt like I couldn't handle everything that was going on, like I was sinking in a sea of my problems and didn't know how to swim. I didn't know how to tell my GP though, couldn't find the right words, I felt so trapped.\n\nThe GP didn't pick up on it, or they didn't seem to. They just kept asking what they could do to help, but I didn't know. I didn't even really know why I was there, only that I needed help. I've never been good at explaining my feelings, at putting into words how I'm doing, so it all felt so pointless. I needed someone to see, to really see what was happening, but they didn't.\n\nI left the GP surgery and things just got worse. I felt so empty, like there was nothing ahead for me. Nothing sparked joy in me, everything became dull and lifeless. I hated feeling this way, this sense of despair. It's a terrifying thought, thinking that you don't want to wake up tomorrow. I just wish the GP had seen it, maybe things would've been different.\n\nThis is NOT real. It's just my feelings at the time and I can't help but think how I could have got help sooner."
"I had an experience at my GP surgery that I will never forget. I'd been feeling so low, I couldn't recall the last time I felt any semblance of happiness. I'd been having these recurring thoughts of doing myself harm. It wasn't any sort of arranged plan, just a consistent nagging in the back of my mind. I thought a trip to the GP might help, that someone would at least acknowledge the mental turmoil I was experiencing.\n\nI waited for over an hour in the waiting room, grappling with my thoughts. When I finally was able to see my doctor, the visit felt rushed. Their eyes constantly flicked towards the clock on the wall. I tried to articulate the severity of what I was feeling, but it seemed as though they just weren't taking it in. I even vocalised my thoughts of self-harm, but I was met with an ambiguous response and a quick prescription for anti-depressants.\n\nI left the surgery feeling unheard, like I was on my own, and worse off than before I went in. I felt like there was no one who would listen, no help for me. And meanwhile, the thoughts wouldn\u2019t go away. I was really scared of what I might do. The system, it could have done a lot better by me that day."
"I visited my local GP surgery last month in a quite bad state. I was battling some feelings that I hadn't really felt before and I didn't really know how to handle them. I kept feeling this urge to harm myself, not to end everything, thank goodness, but just to cause some harm. I thought the pain might distract me from my distressed thoughts. \n\nI told the GP I was assigned all about these feelings. She listened, nodded, gave me some brochures and then sent me out the door with a prescription of meds that I didn't really want. I didn't feel understood, just ticked off some checklist she had. I didn't feel like she really asked me the right questions, or even cared about my situation. \n\nIt's been scary since then. I still constantly feel the urge to hurt myself, but I don't want my family or friends to worry about me. It's a constant struggle, and I'm just hoping things will get better. Please, if you know someone who is battling these thoughts, don't just give them brochures and medications. Listen to them, understand them. Help them feel they're not alone. Because right now, that's how I'm feeling, and it's not the best feeling, you know."
"I had a distressing encounter at my local GP surgery last week. I've been going through a lot lately; it's feeling harder and harder to go on each day. I wanted to discuss these feelings with my GP, so I booked an appointment straight away. When I finally got to talk to the doctor, it was deeply disappointing. \n\nI opened up about my dire circumstances, making it clear that days are getting too tough to handle. I felt bare, vulnerable. I was really hoping for some guidance. But all the doctor offered was a leaflet and advice to \"hang in there\". This left me feeling even more alone and desperate. In that immense pit of despair, I've started to question if I'm better off not existing. \n\nOf course, I would never act on these thoughts. But they are frightening and I lack the support I desperately need. The GP surgery was supposed to be a sanctuary, a place to get help - yet I feel abandoned. I just want to get through this, yet I'm lost and don't know where to turn. I wish the doctors at the surgery understood the true extent of my torment. It feels like I'm crying out into a void at this point. I hope no one else has to feel this way. Very let down."
"Last week I visited my local GP for an appointment. While my doc was professional, I felt that they weren't really listening to my issues. I have told them repeatedly about the constant emptiness I'm feeling, like I'm just going through the motions of life but not really living it. I've tried explaining about my dark thoughts, how I feel like I'm spiralling, and even shared that I have been hurting myself. The cutting offers a bizarre sense of relief from the emotional pain; strange that the physical pain does that but it does. Often, it feels like the only time I have some control. \n\nBut they didn't seem to get it. Even after I spelled it out, they focused on how I just needed to get out more, socialise, make friends. It\u2019s like they can\u2019t see the desperate cries for help behind those statements. It's difficult when even the professionals that are there to help you seem to not understand the depth of your situation. It left me feeling more hopeless, more alone in my struggle. More than ever, I wished I could just stop feeling, stop the constant pain."
"Having visited my local GP yesterday, I felt like there was no understanding of my situation, and I was just another number on their list. I explained that I've started to lose interest in things I once enjoyed. Even getting up in the morning seemed like a huge task. I'd been having thoughts of hurting myself, not wanting to wake up, hoping I could sleep and just never open my eyes again. The time I spent trying to share this with my GP rushy and impersonal. It felt like my words were being shoveled along with the rest of the daily grind. They increased my dosage and sent me on my way, adding an empty promise of a referral to a mental health professional. The disconnect I experienced there, at the surgery, where help is supposed to come from, feels like a kick when I am already on the ground. And now, everything around me seems to echo my dread. I don't know where else to turn. If a doctor's visit feels this isolating and futile, what faith can a person have in getting better? I'm scared and hopeless."
"I feel the need to write about my experience with my local GP surgery three months ago, as my life was on a downward spiral at this point. I had been struggling a lot and couldn't communicate my thoughts and feelings well. This led to me feeling trapped, and I started to have thoughts about hurting myself.\n\nMy visit to the GP was not helpful. I arrived for my appointment in poor emotional condition and waited for an hour past my scheduled time. This increased my feelings of worthlessness. When I did finally speak to the GP, they seemed flustered and too busy to understand the depths of what I was trying to share with them.\n\nI tried to insert my concerns about my thoughts of self-harm into the conversation, hoping to be taken seriously. Instead, I felt brushed off. My pain felt dismissed. The response was a simple increase in medication dosage, but I felt my concerns were not truly acknowledged. \n\nLeaving the surgery, I was in a state of desperation, feeling no sense of care. I had revealed my darkest thoughts and felt neglected. I couldn't shake the feeling of invisibility. \n\nThis experience left me feeling hopeless and detached, and I fear others might have to go through the same. Professional help should be more understanding and attentive. These are life or death situations and must be treated as such."
"I'll tell you, the last time I had an appointment at the surgery, it wasn't too good. I've been feeling that life is losing its meaning for me. Each day seems duller, darker. Felt like I'm just spiraling down, you know? The feelings got so bad, I started thinking about ending my own life. No precise plans, just dreadful thoughts. \n\nTried to raise this with my GP then, thinking they could help. Maybe change my medication, get some counselling, anything. But I got the feeling they were not really listening. Like they were just rushing me out to get the next patient in. Didn't seem too bothered about what I was actually going through.\n\nIt's pretty disheartening when you reach out for help and it feels like you're being brushed off, dismissed. Felt even more alone after that appointment. Ended up going home and just cried for hours. This is a genuine review here. I'm not blaming the GP for how I feel, but a bit more empathy and understanding might have made a difference. At least that's what I think."
"My experiences at the GP surgery were not helpful. I keep remembering the time I went there, feeling so low and hollow. I couldn't even explain what was going on inside my head, how I was contemplating hurting myself. The doctor was polite but clearly quite busy. They dismissed what I was saying as stress and suggested taking a rest. I felt unheard and alone. Their advice didn't help in any way. Rather, it actually increased my anxiety and panic. I remember feeling even more desperate after that visit, even thinking about causing harm to myself, something I'd never thought I'd consider. It was terrifying. I was in a real crisis situation and I don't think they realised the gravity of it. I don't know who to blame, but I think the GP should have listened more carefully and taken me more seriously. I'm scared and I feel like I am falling into a dark abyss and there\u2019s nobody who can save me. I hope I find the help I need soon."
"I visited my GP surgery three weeks ago. I told them all about how I was feeling, how my days were filled with emptiness, how I was constantly thinking about hurting myself. I hoped they would do something, say something, anything that would show me they understood, they cared. But all I got were tired looks and a prescription for some pills. They didn't even bother to check on me afterwards, see if the medicine was working, if I was doing okay. At a time when I was at my lowest, when I desperately needed someone to reach out, all I got was indifference from them. I felt neglected, like they didn't pay any attention to what I was saying. My battle with self-harm wasn't something they wanted to deal with. This has led me to believe they just don't care. I'm scared, I've been having more thoughts about causing harm to myself. I feel alone, I don't know who to turn to. Their lack of concern has made my life more difficult, made my thoughts darker. I'm left feeling like I am fighting this battle all alone. I'm terrified it may be a battle I'm losing."
"I've been to the GP surgery a dozen times over the last three months. It always felt like I was stuck in a loop. A constant reminder of my pain every time I walked through the door. Every doctor, every nurse I saw, I told them that it felt like my life was spiraling out of control. It was like I was falling into a darkness that I couldn't get out of. But it felt like no one was listening to me. I was lost, utterly lost, and I didn't know how much longer I would be able to put up with this.\n\nI lost my job. I stopped seeing my friends. I started to think about hurting myself. I didn't want to continue living like this. The pain was unbearable. I kept asking for help, but the appointments kept coming and going, each one less satisfying than the last. One GP even told me that it was all in my head.\n\nI was overwhelmed. People kept telling me to keep going, but they didn't understand just how much effort it took to put on a brave face, to pretend that everything was okay. I just wanted the pain to disappear, but each day it got worse. I wish someone would've listened to me."
"I visited my GP surgery months ago feeling really low. I've always struggled with feeling down but it's been worse lately. I've been losing sleep, it's like I can't turn my thoughts off. I've lost interest in things I used to enjoy. I've lost appetite and weight. My friendships and relationships are suffering. \n\nAt the appointment, the nurse seemed in a rush. I didn't think I could explain properly. I tried to explain but I was so tearful, the words were jumbled up. Not sure she understood how desperate I feel. \n\nI contemplate hurting myself, think about ending the pain. I don't want to push through anymore, I'm tired. I wish they'd listened, wish they'd helped. Travelling to and from the surgery for that appointment drained me. They scheduled me for another appointment but I'm hesitant. I'm scared, it's like I\u2019m drowning and the lifeboat is slipping away. \n\nDo they understand how much their patients suffer? I need help. I don't wish to die, I just want the pain to stop. I think about ending it all every day. I'm in crisis."
"I've had a really rough time lately and felt like I needed to talk to someone about it. A few months ago, I finally worked up the courage to book an appointment with my local GP. After waiting for what felt like forever, the day finally came. I walked into the surgery, my heart pounding, and tried to explain all the darkness that seemed to be consuming me.\n\nI found it so difficult to communicate how desperate and lost I felt. You see, I've been having these disturbing thoughts for a while now, thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore, not wanting to wake up. There's this deep sorrow and pain inside of me that won't go away. It's scary... the loneliness, the helplessness.\n\nI didn't feel like the doctor understood what I was trying to say. I felt dismissed. He just prescribed some pills and sent me on my way. It didn't reassure me at all. If anything, I left the clinic feeling more disheartened and alone than when I went in. I felt like my feelings and my struggles were downplayed, that they didn't matter. It was such a cold and sterile experience, devoid of compassion or understanding.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I've tried reaching out but nothing seems to help."
"I visited my GP surgery last Tuesday. I told my doctor I was feeling low, very low. I guess I just didn't do a good job of explaining how serious it was. It's not just the sadness, you see, but the weight of it all. The world seemed against me. At nights, scary thoughts, thoughts of hurting my own self, clouded my mind. I felt like I was sinking, each day worse than the day before. I tried to explain it to my GP. I expected... I don't know, maybe more understanding? She just gave me a leaflet and sent me on my way. I left feeling more alone than when I walked in. Life seemed like a never-ending cycle of pain. I needed help. I needed someone to acknowledge what I was going through. I don't know why I'm writing this now, to be honest, I suppose I just want someone to listen. I think it's a feature on this NHS website, being able to share, it allows you to say it as it is, which was not something I was able to do in my GP's little room last Tuesday. It's scary, very scary."
"I've had difficult times before, but last month became a real low for me. I visited my GP surgery because I just felt I couldn't go on anymore. I remember sitting in the bleak waiting room, counting every tick of the clock, feeling like every second was a mountain to climb.\n\nIt was a struggle to share what I was feeling, the constant numbness and despair. I mentioned how thoughts of ending it all kept creeping into my mind, how some nights I'd lay there thinking about means of self harm. Thankfully, I didn't have a specific plan, but I was scared of how far I might go. \n\nThe GP I spoke to seemed rushed, I didn't feel heard. I was given a prescription and told to come back if it didn't improve. It felt dismissive, as though my struggle was just another routine problem to fix.\n\nIn the end, I was left feeling even more hopeless. The thought that no one really cares stung bitterly. I was longing for a more supportive and understanding interaction, something to pull me back from the edge. Navigating through this feeling isn't easy, especially when you're feeling like you're drowning and the people who are supposed to help seem indifferent."
"I visited my GP clinic last month. Felt like my head was about to explode, like I was losing control of my own thoughts. Couldn't stop myself from the mental image replaying in my mind, of me hurting myself when I looked at sharp objects. I remember being on edge, constantly in a fight or flight mode. Felt so isolated, like I was in a deep well of darkness and pain. It was a constant struggle to keep my head afloat, the pain eating away at me from the inside.\n\nTold my doctor about how I was feeling. Don't think he took it seriously. Felt he was trying to brush off my concerns. He prescribed me some pills, said it would help me loosen up. I felt like those pills were just sugar-coated lies, meant to keep me quiet. \n\nAfter taking the medication as prescribed, I felt my anxiety levels going off the charts. There was no easing of the imagery; if anything, they looked sharper, more intense. It was like my own mind was battling against me.\n\nFelt cornered, hopeless, despair washing over me like a huge wave. I knew I needed some form of help, but the attempts I made seemed futile. The health system which was supposed to help me, felt like a trap. I wasn't sure who to trust, where to go or how to ask for help anymore."
"I visited my GP surgery about two weeks ago. The waiting room felt like a prison, it was very full and noisy. I felt alone even though there were so many people there. I was there because I couldn't stand to be in my own skin any longer. I didn't say that to my doctor, though. It seemed too much. \n\nI told the doctor I couldn't sleep. That I was always tired but wide awake at night. I said I felt sad, but it's more than that. It feels like a heavy weight that I can't shake off. The doctor was nice and kind but I didn't feel like he understood. He gave me some sleeping tablets and sent me away. I've been following his advice but it's not really working.\n\nI still have the same feelings. Feel like there's no way out. I keep thinking about how much easier it would be if I wasn't here. My family would be better off without me dragging them down. Just wanted to share this. It's too hard to say it out loud."
"I'm usually not one for writing these things, but I had a really tough time at my GP's office. I've been struggling, really struggling. There's been a lot going on and I can't seem to catch a break. It feels like everything has been piling up and up and I'm so tired. It's like I'm trapped under a pile of rubble, suffocating and helpless, not knowing whether I will get out alive.\n\nThe doctor didn't really seem to understand. I didn't feel listened to, like the real depth of what I was experiencing wasn't being recognized. That's been hard. They gave me some information and sent me on my way, but it didn't feel like enough. \n\nI've been having thoughts, dangerous, terrifying thoughts, of not wanting to be here anymore. Maybe that would be easier. But I know these thoughts aren't right, and they scare me. It's lonely and frightening and I really need someone to understand, to pull me out of this pit I've fallen into. The GP surgery was supposed to be that lifeline, but my last visit didn't provide the reassurance I desperately needed. I just hope they understand the severity of this next time. Please, let's take this seriously."
"I visited my local GP surgery last week, desperate for some help. I told the doctor in charge how awful I was feeling, how some days I didn't even want to see the sunlight anymore. I told him that I'd found myself looking at sharp objects with too much curiosity \u2013 kitchen knives and shards of glass, you know? I explained that my sleep was all messed up and I couldn't stop thinking about... well, not being around anymore.\n\nHe seemed too busy, just told me to keep taking the antidepressants he'd given me before and didn't suggest any sort of therapy or further assistance. I felt brushed off and not heard; like a nuisance more than a patient in need. The visit didn't help in the slightest, just added to the feeling of hopelessness.\n\nI'd initially thought seeing him, speaking out about these things would sort of 'siphon off' some of the darkness. It did not.\n\nNot too hopeful for the future at the moment. I don't know what to do next, every path just seems filled with darkness. That doc really was my last hope. What's even more, no option for immediate counseling or a hotline was given. I'm terrified, lost and just want someone to help me."
"My experience at the GP surgery yesterday has left me in a bigger mess than I originally was in. I'd summoned the courage to walk into that office only to be met with dismissive stares and curt responses. I'd been feeling this indescribable pain for weeks now, like a tight knot in my chest, persistent and unsettling, making every heartbeat more torturous than the last. This isn't about physical pain though, it's different, it's on the inside and much worse.\n\nI thought sharing my feelings with the GP would help, but their patronizing tone only added to my distress. They suggested it was 'all in my head', like it was trivial, when I'd been fighting myself every day to get out of bed, to fake a smile, to live. I'd battled these dark thoughts in secrecy, self-harm became a strange comfort.\n\nThey seem to have given up on me, but worst of all, I've given up on myself. I'm feeling much lower now. The vague advice about 'talking therapies' fell on deaf ears. I feel disoriented, like I'm losing my grip on the hope that things might change, that I might come out of this downward spiral. It's like I'm drowning but I can see everyone around me breathing."
"I had my appointment with the GP last Wednesday and I won't lie, I've been struggling quite a bit. The truth is, I've been feeling really lost and hopeless. The world seems very heavy and it's been difficult to see any light at the end of all this. I've been having thoughts about hurting myself, just to escape the emptiness. It feels like I'm trapped, suffocating. It's incredibly scary and I don't know who or where to turn to.\n\nThe GP was good, she gave me some numbers for local mental health services but it all felt very clinical, impersonal. It's like I'm just another patient on their checklist. I didn't feel heard or understood. I felt like a burden, in all honesty. I don't know what to do or where to go from here. It feels like I'm shouting into a void. Nothing makes sense. I feel all alone in this. \n\nI guess I just wanted someone to truly understand, to help me see some hope. But right now, it feels like there's none. It's a desperate place to be. It scares me to admit it but these dangerous thoughts are becoming more common. I don't want to be alone in this."
"I've had a rough few months, the worst of my life actually. Things didn't go well with the GP at my local NHS surgery. I felt they weren't listening to me at all. I repeatedly told them how life was becoming unbearable and full of desperation, but I felt dismissed, like my pain was no big deal.\n\nEvery visit to the surgery, I told them how I kept imagining harming myself - just to stop the pain inside. That I was tired, so tired of everything, of feeling like this. I was practically begging for help. Some kind of treatment, some form of relief, but all I got was a brief conversation where they shrugged my feelings off, saying it was normal. How is this supposed to be normal? \n\nI'm not sure how to cope anymore. Feeling so helpless is really getting to me. I just wanted someone to understand, to acknowledge my pain, to give me some hope but it felt like they pushed me to the side. \n\nThis service should be about helping, but I didn't feel helped. I still feel like I'm drowning."
"My experience with the GP surgery has been less than satisfactory. I was already walking a fine line in terms of my mental health but felt everything crumbling after my most recent visit. The care, or lack thereof, was nothing short of shocking. The doctor I saw seemed uninterested in my struggle, making me feel more invisible than I already did. \n\nAll I wanted was someone to hear me out, some acknowledgement that I wasn't okay. I've been suffering in silence for so long, it felt unbearable. Thoughts of self-harm have filled my mind more often than I'd like these past weeks, making existence itself a painstaking task. \n\nWhen you're in that dark and lonely place, the least bit of empathy goes a long way. But that was not to be found with the GP I saw. I've been feeling so lost, so low, slipping further into the void and I feel as though the health service did not take my concerns seriously. Right now, what I need most is care, understanding, and support to pull through this crisis but I've found none from my surgery. Is this supposed to be my reality? Feel like I'm spiralling and nobody seems to care!"
"I visited the GP surgery last Tuesday. I was feeling really down for weeks. I tried telling the GP. I mentioned feeling empty, like I didn't matter anymore. The GP said I'm dealing with depression and prescribed some pills. I've been taking them but so far, no real improvement. I tried calling the surgery again but waiting for an appointment felt like forever. I'm having a really hard time sleeping and meals seem useless. So difficult to enjoy anything at all. I keep having dark thoughts more often. It's hard, you know, to constantly try to keep these thoughts at bay. It feels like I'm getting sucked into a black hole from which there's no escape. I'm not saying I will do anything to myself but things are getting pretty scary here. I'm not sure what to do."
"I visited my GP surgery a few weeks ago. It was one of the toughest experiences of my life. Not because of the staff, they did their best. But I was at the edge, still am. I remember the last surgery visit like it happened yesterday. I sat down, right there in Dr. Carter's office, and told him everything. I spilled the beans about the immense feelings of emptiness, the constant thoughts of self harm, how it was getting harder to hold on every day.\n\nDr. Carter, he listened. He seemed concerned. Referred me to a mental health specialist. But the truth is, despite taking that step, nothing changed. There is this unbearable pain inside me, reminding me every second of how worthless I am. I remember going home that day, looking at myself in the mirror, and feeling like a shadow. \n\nDr. Carter did his best, provided me with resources, contacts of specialists, and crisis helplines. But no amount of help seems to penetrate this black cloud hovering over me. I'm caught in this vortex of despair and it seems impossible to escape. \n\nIn all honesty, I'm not even seeking help anymore. I've tried to reach out but everything seems pointless."
"I've been seeing the doctors at this surgery for years and it feels like things have only gotten worse. I used to think it was just a phase and they kept telling me it would get better, but the desolation in my head hasn't stopped. I've been in a very dark place for a while now. \n\nEach day for me has been the same; waking up with the weight of the world on my shoulders, desperately trying to hold on. The feelings started creeping in about a year ago and I tried addressing it with my GP; they gave me some antidepressants and a few sessions with a therapist. The medicine didn't help and the therapy sessions were brief, it felt like a cold and mechanical process rather than genuine help. \n\nI often think about ending it all to just stop the pain. But don't worry, I don't have a plan or anything. I just wish someone from the surgery really listened to me when I told them how much I'm struggling. I mean, I'm telling the world now in hopes that someone might just hear me. Maybe even help me. That's all I've ever wanted - to be heard."
"I visited my GP about a month ago, feeling desperate. I told them about the tight knot in my stomach, about the all-consuming darkness, the endless, sleepless nights. I spelt it out, how sometimes, I scare myself with the thoughts I have. How I sometimes imagine things \u2013 things with blades, things with high places, things that blur the line between life and death. \n\nHe listened. Then, he recommended a therapist and some light exercise, suggesting I could be suffering from stress and anxiety. He just didn't get it\u2014he didn't see my pain. I've been on waiting lists for months now. I called, I sat on the cold plastic chairs in the waiting room. I'm slipping away, and the help I need feels like a mirage.\n\nI'm not just stressed. It's more than that, something deeper and scarier, yet they can't see it. They don't see it. It has been more than two months since that day, and the dark thoughts are not going away. They grow, they thrive, feasting on every failed attempt to reach out. I'm not sure how long I can hold on without the professional help I need so desperately."
"I had a bad few months and went in to see my GP to describe what I was going through. Everything felt so heavy on me, like a massive load crushing me constantly. Even in the waiting room, I couldn't stop the tears from rolling down my face - felt pretty embarassed but it's hard to control sometimes. The GP was good and listened to me, but I didn't feel like he really understood the depth of my despair. I kept saying things like \"I felt so lost, so tired, I don't know how to cope anymore,\" you know, those sort of things that indicated I wasn't just feeling blue. \n\nBut he was trying to reassure me it's just a phase, it'll pass, just the usual stuff, even prescribing some pills. Maybe I wasn't clear enough, or maybe he didn't have the time to dig deeper. Don't know. But I walked out of the office feeling even worse than when I walked in, felt like there was no point in sharing, no point of continuing. I didn't know how to explain the nightmare I'm living - how to get across the fact that I just want relief from the pain. It's a dark place out there in my world."
"I'd seen my GP practice only a few times last month. I've been struggling, finding it harder and harder to face each day. Just felt like I was drowned in my own problems, but the mental aspect of it didn't feel relevant because mine was a cry for help, I now realise.\n\nI remember telling the doctor that I can't sleep well. I've been having the same recurring nightmare repeatedly. And when I wake up, I just didn't feel like moving or doing anything. I'd spend my days mostly by myself, ignored calls and messages, stopped eating properly. I felt myself deteriorating, my energy slipping away each passing day.\n\nLast week, out of desperation, I went back to the surgery. I marked higher in those 'scale of 1-10' questions in the paper they gave but not sure if anyone really noticed or took it seriously. I wished they could see the torture, the trauma I was unable to express with words. \n\nI am in pain. Inside and outside. Can't decide which weighs heavier - the physical emptiness I feel or the craving for relief. I quietly gave them a plea, hoping someone would understand, hoping someone would help. But it all seems like a foggy dream I'm failing to wake up from."
"Last Tuesday, I visited my GP surgery. I felt so lonely and trapped, like there was no way out. Everyone was kind to me there, but it just made me realise how much I was struggling. I don't want to stick out, causing trouble for anyone. It's tough living every day, feeling like I'm in a deep hole and there's no ladder to climb out. No tools to dig my way out. \n\nThe GP was nice enough, took her time to listen to me. But I felt strained the entire duration because I didn't really explain what I go through every day. My mind's been muddled and I'm losing my grip on things. Don't have a plan of action or anything, it's just a loop of distress in my head. \n\nThe medication, don't think it's working. Maybe it's just my state of mind, won't even let the pills do their magic. \n\nI've been seriously thinking about ending it all, haven't figured out the 'how' yet. But it's a thought that's there, you know. Wish I was able to talk about my thoughts at the GP, but I just couldn't get the words out. Maybe this is my way of reaching out to someone. Maybe someone can hear me through these words because I'm really scared I might do something. I need help."
"I'm writing this review after my last visit to the GP surgery. I've been struggling quite a bit lately, with severe internal distress. I've had tinges of these feelings before, but they've gotten much stronger recently. I've been feeling in a pit of despair, like I'm just sinking deeper. There have been moments when I've thought about hurting myself. It's just a thought, not a plan, but it's there. I'm scared of it. \n\nI told my GP about all of this. Do you know what they said? They told me to hang in there, that it will pass. Didn't seem concerned! I hoped to get help, or at least some sort of direction. But I left the clinic feeling more alone and desperate than before. I don't know what to do anymore. I felt ignored, not heard at all. There isn't much else to say, I suppose. I'm in a bad place right now and I'm seriously worried about my own safety. I pray to be out of this dark tunnel soon. Not sure when or how that will be, but here's hoping."
"I went to my local GP surgery last month, begging for help. I've been feeling quite low for some time and it has reached a point where I've been contemplating causing discomfort to myself. It's terrifying how my thoughts have spiralled in this direction. \n\nI sought solace from my GP hoping they'd know what to do, how to help me. But after waiting for an hour beyond my appointment time, the meeting felt rushed. It felt as if I was just another patient with a list of symptoms. I tried, in my state of turmoil, to voice out my mental struggle, but words failed me. \n\nThe five-minute conversation ended with a prescription of pills, no therapy. No follow-ups arranged. I felt more desperate leaving the surgery than when I walked in. \n\nHow do you tell someone you've thought about hurting yourself? How do you seek help when the very service designed to help you makes you feel insignificant? \n\nI'm in a crisis, and I reached out for a lifeline, but I feel more alone than ever. The system is failing me, it's failing people like me. We need more than a quick fix; we deserve compassion and understanding."
"I visited my GP surgery last week and felt like my concerns were totally dismissed. I had been struggling a lot lately, feeling like I had lost all control over my life and was trapped in a cycle of noise, pressure, and darkness. It wasn't the first time I'd felt like this. I'd spent many nights crying myself to sleep, my mind swirling with thoughts of despair, worthlessness and an unbearable urge to hurt myself. But I managed to gather courage to ask for help. \n\nThe appointment did not make things better. Instead, I felt unheard. The doctor was impatient, barely looked up from his computer, and brushed off my complaints as 'stress'. I had come prepared to talk, to reveal my deep-seated fears and darkness, but all I encountered was indifference. \n\nThis is not about attention. It is not about being melodramatic. I wanted them to know that their dismissive attitudes, their lack of proper responses or care, can result in terrible consequences. I don't know how to live with this constant pain anymore. I am terrified and I am deeply alone. Something needs to change before it's too late for me. \n\nI am hoping that someone reads this and does something about it. No one should feel so unseen, so unheard, so uncared for."
"I went to my GP surgery last Tuesday, desperate for help. I felt like I was drowning, every day was like battling through a storm that wouldn't let up. Last month the feelings had escalated and I had tried to hurt myself, I didn't know what else to do to stop the pain. It's impossible to put into words just how desperate I felt. My GP gave me a few minutes of his time, enough to scribble something onto a prescription pad. But I felt dismissed, left to fend for myself. No discussion, no real listening and definitely no understanding. It was like I was crying out in a void, clamouring for help and receiving none. He didn't seem to care that I was hanging on by a thread, all alone with these thoughts of not wanting to exist anymore. I left feeling even more hopeless, if that was possible. Now, I don't know what to do or where to go. There's this frightful emptiness inside of me. It feels like I'm already gone. Maybe I'm beyond help."
"Last Tuesday, I visited my GP surgery for my distress. Felt like a cog in a machine, no feeling of being cared for. I explained I was really struggling. I told the doctor that there's a nagging pain in my chest, like I cannot breathe. Terrible sleep for weeks. I even mentioned the phrases that won't leave me alone, the constant thoughts of not wanting to see another day. \n\nThe doctor said it was just anxiety, handed me a prescription for sleeping pills and sent me on my way. No referral. No further questioning. No empathy. Just pills. \n\nIt's been three days since that visit. The pills aren't working. Nights are becoming worse. Constant thoughts about hurting myself, feeling like I might not be able to carry on. They shouldn't be this loud. \n\nI am already dealing with so much at home and work. Now, even this surgery that once used to be a safe space feels off. How can I trust them again? Sleep deprived, mental and physical health going down with every passing day. I'm feeling really exhausted. \n\nDesperate for help, I write here. The GP failed to take my symptoms seriously. Why was I given pills and not actual, emotional help? Feeling unheard and dismissed. Desperate to be seen, not as just a patient, but as a human in need."
"I visited my GP surgery last month seeking help. I've been feeling utterly hopeless for longer than I can remember. The pressure inside of me is getting too much to bear and has been for a while now. It feels like I'm at a point where I can't go on. I tried opening up to my GP about my suffering, but the conversation was hurried and I felt unheard. \n\nI wanted to express how I've been hurting myself, small things at first, just to cope with the pain inside. But it's gotten worse in the recent weeks, and I'm losing control of it. I've started contemplating if there's a way out from all of this pain, if life can stop being so relentless. \n\nMy GP prescribed some medication but it did not help. It just allowed me to sleep, sleep and escape from reality, but I can't sleep away my life. I'm not sure where to turn anymore, but I know I need help. I'm reaching out because I can't stay this way. I'm really scared. I feel I'm slipping away and I'm afraid it could be too late soon. I hope this review gets seen.\n"
"Had my appointment with the GP surgery last Wednesday. Honestly, felt like there wasn't much point in going, didn't think anyone would understand me. Wasn't sure what to expect, but I tried to explain how I felt, like I was stuck in this dark place, no way out.  I've been struggling, thoughts of ending it all keep popping up, it's scary.\n\nThe GP listened, but I couldn't help feeling they didn't really get it. I felt like just another name on their list. This wasn't the first time I felt like this, and each time it\u2019s getting harder to manage. The waiting room felt suffocating, realizing I wasn't the only one feeling this way.\n\nI wish there was someone to talk to, someone who understands. People around me don't seem to realize how desperate I am, how I'm constantly battling myself, trying to push away thoughts about harming myself. \n\nGot another appointment in two weeks, they said therapy might help, medication was also mentioned. Not sure if I can hold on till then. I wish someone would genuinely listen and help me. Going through this alone is a nightmare and I need help. I hope they realize this before it's too late."
"I went to see my GP last week due to feeling awful. Been hopeless and feeling like there was just no way out. I was so tired of life and everything felt so heavy. Like I'm in a hole and I can't climb out. I even explained how I had started self-harming, thinking it would numb the emotional pain. Barely sleeping, having nightmares when I do. My GP seemed to rush me out of their office, an unwanted disruption in their busy day. The pills they've given me aren't helping. I don't know what to do anymore. It's not helping, and I don't think it ever will. The sense of despair is unbearable. The self-harm is becoming more frequent. I need help, I really do."
"I visited my GP surgery recently and I didn't leave feeling any better. I've been feeling lost for a while now, like I'm stuck in a dark tunnel with no end in sight. The GP, although professional, didn't seem to understand the depth of my sorrow. I told him, straightforward, that I often think about not being here any more. Instead of immediate support, he suggested increasing my medication and setting up a future appointment.\n\nI've talked to him before about feeling hopeless and he knows I've self-harmed in the past. I can't shake these thoughts off, they just come back stronger. What worries me is that I'm getting too comfortable with them. No matter how many times I tell them, I don't think they get it.\n\nI don't have a plan to take my life but the idea is constantly there. I think about not creating any more pain to my family, not being a burden anymore. It's scary to think that these thoughts are becoming almost normal. But I don't know what else to do, where else to go, or who else to speak to. This review is my last resort. Maybe someone, anyone, can help.\n"
"I've been visiting my GP surgery for a while, they were supposed to help me. But it felt like every time I went, they saw me as just another patient. They never seemed to understand what I was going through. It was always prescriptions, therapy referrals, check-ups. I was drowning and it felt like no one could see it. Everything got so heavy, even breathing became a chore. I started thinking about ending it all, like those thoughts were my only escape. But I was scared to say it out loud, scared they'd lock me up somewhere far from my family, or just not understand how I felt. Once, I did try to tell my GP, but it felt like my words fell on deaf ears. I mentioned my feelings... hoping they would pick up on it. But it didn't change anything. I was still left alone with my thoughts. I've been in a dark place, struggling to see a light. The hardest part was the isolation I felt, even within the clinic's walls. I really needed more help than what I received."
"I visited my local GP surgery last Wednesday. I've been feeling a lot of despair and hurt recently and it's been so overwhelming I can't think straight. My own thoughts have been scary and I don't understand them. I've been thinking about hurting myself, well to be honest, it's more than just thinking. I wish I could explain this feeling better, but it's like I'm drowning and I can't keep my head above water. It's almost like there's some destructive force within me, seeking to do damage. \n\nIt took everything within me to make it to the GP surgery. If not for the constant urging from my neighbor, I'm not sure I would've made it there. The doctor was patient but seemed preoccupied with other things. I felt like he wasn't really understanding the depth of my issue. After a brief chat and a prescription for pills, I was sent on my way. It felt very mechanical, impersonal, and left me feeling more alone than when I walked in. I'm at a loss, and I\u2019m scared. I don't know how to deal with these feelings. I feel like I'm slipping and there's nothing to grab onto. I'm hoping for some sort of help, just don't know where it should come from."
"I went to my GP surgery last week feeling lost and hopeless. I've reached a point where I don't see a way out. The darkness is too much to bear and it's like my life has lost all its joy. I've told my GP about my thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore. The feeling is overwhelming and nothing seems to help. I'm not eating, not sleeping. My GP just shook their head and referred me to a psychiatrist, said they couldn't do anything else for me. I've been on a waiting list now, it seems like forever, and every passing day feels heavier. I'm on the edge and it feels like I'm incapable of pulling myself back. I spend most of my days thinking about how it would just be easier if I was gone. The pain is unbearable and I feel utterly alone. I don't know what to do. I have explicitly expressed these feelings with the GP but it seemed like they did nothing about it. I feel ignored and brushed aside. I am in a state of distress and each passing moment is torture for me."
"I've never felt this way before, and honestly, it's terrifying. During the past few weeks, I've felt more alone than ever. The people at the GP surgery could see I wasn't myself, but they just didn't seem to understand. I remember, specifically, when I was in the waiting room. It was full of people, happy people, but all I felt was alone. \n\nThe severity of my feelings started to resonate when I was talking to the GP. I tried to articulate my turmoil, warned him of the fear that I might harm myself. But he just stared at me, not seeming to fathom how pressing my situation was. \n\nI walked out of there knowing that I needed help, him dismissing my pleas, suggesting that I should take some time out and relax. But, it's not that simple, is it? Just to \"relax\" when your thoughts are pushing you towards a ledge. \n\nI'm at a point in my life now where I don't know how to deal with this, where even the smallest things make me feel worthless. This isn't a cry for attention. I desperately need somebody to listen, to take a step back and truly understand. Just dismissive words and a forced smile won't save a person in crisis. A GP surgery ought to be my safe place, but for me, it feels like a minefield.\n"
"My experience with the GP surgery hasn't been the best. Last month, I went there hoping to get some help. Unfortunately, things didn't go as expected. I was feeling really helpless then, sinking into this darkness I didn't know how to get out of. I explained the thoughts I was having, the constant hurting, the thoughts of self-harm that kept poking at me. But it felt like they were too busy, I felt brushed off. \n\nNo one took enough time to talk to me, it was all done in such haste. I was looking for someone to understand, to help me navigate my feelings. I craved someone to tell me that everything was going to be alright, but no one did. The doctor said he'd refer me to counselling, but till now, I haven't heard anything. He even told me the waiting list was long, hinting I needed to be patient. \n\nIn my state, I don't think I can wait that long. Each day's a struggle. I pleaded for some interim support, but nothing came of that. Since that day, my thoughts have worsened, and I continue to feel lost. I'm in desperate need of help, of something to hold onto. It's been a heartbreaking journey with this GP surgery, and I'm still stuck in that dark hole."
"I've been trying to hold it together, I really have. But it's just been too much. I had an appointment at my GP surgery yesterday, for the usual script run. But I... uh, I let it slip how desperate I'm feeling. I said I'd been thinking about ending things, you know... because I hate feeling this way. The GP looked at me, looked right through me it felt like. Said we'd discuss it at my next appointment, but that's a full two weeks away. It was like my words didn't matter. \n\nNo plan. No idea how I'd... you know. That takes thought, and I'm just so tired I can hardly think straight. But the feeling is there, getting stronger. The pain's inside my head... it's like a radio tuned to a bad station, all fuzz and static and it just won't stop. Every thought ends with it... with not wanting to wake up again. Just to wake up and not feel like this anymore.\n\nI'm posting this because it feels like the last place where I haven't been shut down. Anyway, that's my experience... frightening, frustrating and I'm left alone to wrestle with these thoughts. It's lonely. Sometimes, I wonder if anyone would even notice if I were gone. Reviews are supposed to help people, aren't they? Maybe this might help someone see what it's really like."
"I feel alone, completely overwhelmed by everything. I went to my local GP surgery three months ago because I had lost all hope in life and was struggling with disturbing thoughts about ending my own life. I remember walking through the door, feeling so vulnerable, trying to explain to a stranger what I was experiencing. I told the doctor about the constant darkness in my mind, about how I couldn't see a future for myself. He referred me to a counsellor which didn't really help. Weeks turned into months with no change, thoughts of self-harm have been ruining my sleep. It feels like a constant battle, the pain and despair follow me everywhere. I desperately want to escape it all. I feel like I'm sinking deeper into this hole. Life just seems too hard at the moment. I need help - fast. I'm saying this here in hopes someone will read it and take it seriously. I don't know what else to do."
"I went to my GP nearly 3 weeks ago feeling really low and having scary thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore. I've felt like this for months now. The GP heard me out but made me feel rushed, like I was taking up their time. To be fair, they did say they were going to refer me to a specialist, but I still haven't heard anything. There are days I'm able to distract myself, but the nights, they're the worst. I\u2019ve tried speaking to friends, but I still feel alone. I need help now, not in a few weeks. If they had given me some kind of support to hold onto, maybe a helpline or anything that would be there when things get too much, I wouldn't be writing this review. The whole process just made me feel like I was alone in dealing with this, which is terrifying. It's really hard not knowing when you're going to get help, or even if you're going to get help. All I want is to feel safe again and I just don't. The wait is the worst part."
"I had a visit with my GP at the surgery a couple of weeks ago. I remember leaving the appointment feeling unheard and dismissed. I'd been having such a rough time lately, suffering in silence a lot. Been feeling like there's a big black hole inside me that I just can't shake off. It's almost overwhelming sometimes. I've been feeling really low, like there's no point to anything anymore. There have been a couple of times in the past few days where I've thought about hurting myself, just to try and make the emptiness go away. I even vaguely remember considering it seriously. It's scary to acknowledge these feelings. But, when I shared this with my GP, they just seemed to shrug it off like it wasn't a big deal. I was sent home with some resources and that's it. I was hoping for more help, more understanding. I just want to feel normal again. Now, I'm not even sure if I can fight this anymore. I just don't know. Things need to change. I'm desperate."
"Last week, I had an appointment at my GP surgery. I got there feeling quite low and desperate, with thoughts of harming myself. I told myself it was just a rough patch, that everyone went through these. Trying to convince myself, I decided to share my feelings with the GP. I explained how I was constantly tired, irritable, and just feeling an unbearable heaviness. It seemed like I was eternally in a dark tunnel, with no light at the end. All I wanted was to escape, to numb my thoughts.\n\nThe GP listened, or at least appeared to. He told me I was just stressed, although I had been explaining how it goes beyond just stress. I felt a strange mix of relief and worry \u2013 relief that someone was aware of my internal struggles, and worry over the sheer helplessness of my situation. I wanted to believe the GP, that it was just stress and it would pass. But days turned into weeks, and I was only spiralling deeper into my own abyss of despair. \n\nThe thought of self-harm kept coming back, wrapping me in a shroud of darkness. That's why I'm writing this. Maybe someone will notice. Maybe someone will help. I'm scared, struggling and I don't know how to continue. I did my part, I reached out, but does anyone at the surgery know how to handle this?"
"I'm not really one to write reviews or anything, but I feel like I have to talk about my recent visit to my GP surgery. I don't know why, but I just felt that my life wasn't worth living anymore. I had been feeling this crushing sadness and couldn't see any point to anything. I decided to go to my GP surgery, hoping someone there might be able to help me. \n\nI sat in the waiting room, feeling like I was drowning. But the staff, they seemed so busy and so unaware of what I was going through. They gave me some flyers about mental health services, but that's not really what I needed in that moment. I needed someone to take me seriously and help me. \n\nI left the surgery feeling worse than when I came in. Nobody seemed to understand me or care about how I was feeling. I was desperate, feeling like I was staring into a black hole and being sucked in. \n\nI'm not sure how to end this. I just want people to know that the service I received didn't help. My cry for help was left unanswered."
"I had a visit to my local GP surgery last week due to feeling unwell. Sadly, the experience was not pleasant. I tried sharing my thoughts and feelings, but it felt like they didn't really listen. I expressed multiple times that I felt a darkness coming over me but it seemed to fall on deaf ears. I was in a heightened state of distress after the visit; so much so that I was contemplating harming myself. It's a scary thought to think, to want to hurt myself, and I am sure it's not normal, but it's how I felt.\n\nI've spent long nights staring at the ceiling, lost in my thoughts, feeling like I'm reaching a dead end. I dread waking up to face another day. I've thrown subtle hints about these feelings, hoping for some help, maybe a sign or a word to pull me out of this gloom. But nothing. Nothing from the surgery. They said they'd call back after my blood tests, but no one did. I had to call them repeatedly, only to be told to wait.\n\nThe indifference and lack of proper communication at the GP surgery made my doubts and fears much worse. I feel lonely, helpless and misunderstood. Being dismissed when you need help the most is not good. I hope no one else has to go through such an experience. It's hard. Everything just feels hard. The GP surgery needs to improve their patient care, so people like me are not left feeling this way."
"I visited my GP surgery last week to talk about what I was feeling but it didn't go as expected. I told my GP about my feelings, how I was finding it hard to stay upbeat and was having thoughts of self-harm. Maybe I didn't explain it well or they didn't understand, I'm not sure. I've been feeling trapped in my own life and was really hoping my GP would help me. Instead, they just said I needed to try harder to be happy, which actually made me feel worse. It seemed like the darkness in my head was being ignored or undervalued. Very disappointed and feeling even more alone now. I've struggled with my mood before but never felt this hopeless... fearful for what might happen next without the proper support. Please be more understanding, and don't just brush off concerns like mine so casually. I don't even know what to do now. Relying on my friends is not easy as they also have their own lives and problems. I hope this surgery can better understand people like me who are losing hope day by day."
"I visited my GP surgery a few weeks back, I was feeling very low. I thought I could muster up the courage to tell my doctor about it all, but I bottled up. I sat there in the waiting room, surrounded by people, but I've never felt so alone. I was drowning in my thoughts, feeling like I'm worth nothing, the world would probably be better off without me. I felt so trapped, like I was falling into a deep hole and I can't crawl out. Every day felt worse than the last.\n\nWhen I spoke to the doctor, I couldn't bring myself to express any of this. Instead, I remained silent when they asked me about my well-being. They asked if I was okay, and I lied by saying I'm just tired. They didn't even question it further. It was disheartening how easily I was dismissed, with pills for something that isn't even the real issue.\n\nI'm writing this review because I hope someone, somewhere within the NHS is reading this, and understands that there is a desperate need for more mental health support. And hopefully, it prevents someone else from feeling as alone as I have been feeling in this."
"I can't say that my experience with my GP surgery has been positive recently. I visited last month feeling very low, feeling isolated and trapped in my own mind. Compared to my earlier experiences, the care didn't match up. It felt like no one understood my burden and I was simply dismissed with a prescription and nothing more. \n\nThe doctor didn\u2019t seem concerned about what I was telling him, brushing off my feelings of despair. I expressed to him that I felt like I didn't want to exist anymore, there was no light at the end of the tunnel for me. But his responses did not reassure me that I was being heard or taken seriously. \n\nI feel so alone, like I am caught in a never-ending cycle of pain. The thought of harming myself sometimes cross my mind, but I\u2019ve not acted on it. I don\u2019t have a plan, but these are dangerous thoughts. I need help. There needs to be better support at GP surgeries for people like me. Without it, I'm scared of the road I might end up going down."
"I went to the GP surgery last Thursday because I was really struggling. I'd been feeling a lot of darkness inside me every single day and for the first time, I thought about not wanting to wake up in the morning. I'd never felt like this before and it scared me. I waited for an hour and a half at the surgery, my nerves like glass.\n\nWhen I finally saw the doctor, he seemed very busy and rushed. I tried to explain what I was feeling inside, how I just wanted the pain to stop and even contemplated self harm, but he just gave me a prescription for sleeping pills and said I should take some time off work. He didn't seem to understand the gravity of my words. \n\nFrustrated and feeling unheard, I went home. The sleeping pills don't help. They just numb everything. I'm still scared and I'm not sure where to turn. I really needed the GP to listen that day. I hope if someone else is going through this, they are treated differently at the GP surgery."
"My last visit to the GP surgery was two weeks ago, it was as disappointing as the few that came before it. I've told them, over and over, how I've been feeling. How it feels like I'm at the end of my rope, like I just can't see any positives left in my life anymore. I've had sleepless nights clinging onto whatever bit of hope I could, hoping that they might be able to help. But all I get is redirected, passed around from one doctor to another like a burden they can't be bothered to deal with. \n\nI've been honest about the dangerous thoughts I've been having. I even confessed about how I've considered hurting myself. I just wished for a shred of empathy, a sense of someone understanding what I'm going through. Instead, I was met with an indifferent stare, a continued referral and a lack of immediate action, despite the severity of what I shared. \n\nThe scenario made me feel unheard and invisible. I felt the crushing weight of despair engulfing me more than ever. The very place I turned to for help, seemed to be the one pushing me further into my gloomy thoughts. I hate having these feelings, and this whole situation just makes it harder for me."
"I went to my GP surgery last week feeling completely hopeless. Thought they'd help, but it felt like they didn't really want to know. I tried to explain what I was going through, deep inside, every day and night but they just didn't get it. I'm having a really hard time.  It's scary, you know? How broken I am, just wanting the pain to stop, like thinking maybe it'd be better if I wasn't here. Not going to do anything, but the thoughts, they keep coming. \n\nI feel stuck. After the appointment, I felt just discarded, not treated like someone who was desperately seeking help. Their response was a leaflet and instructions to call Samaritans if I felt bad. To me, that wasn't enough, it wasn't real support. \n\nFelt like my voice wasn't heard, felt brushed aside. They ought to have been more understanding. I needed human connection, validation, not just a leaflet and a lacklustre pat on the back. I think they need to consider how they deal with people like me because it wasn't helpful. I'm just hoping one day, I will get the help I need."
"I've been attending my local GP surgery for many months now. At first I thought it was just stress and feeling a bit low, but it has been getting worse. I found myself constantly in a dark place, frequently having thoughts about harming myself. I would sit alone at night, with no desire to continue living, but no plans to commit suicide. \n\nDespite frequent visits, I felt my concerns had been dismissed by my GP. They made changes to my medication several times but nothing seemed to improve my outlook. Whenever I explained how desperate I felt, I was told it would get better with time. It reached the point where I dreaded my appointments, scared of being told once more that this was normal, it was just part of the process. \n\nI started to feel entirely alone, like nobody understood my urge to just make the pain stop. Even though people told me that it would be okay, I didn't want to carry on. The ongoing emptiness just felt too heavy. \n\nI'm crying out for help, I don't want to be a burden, but I don't know how much longer I can go on without proper support. It feels like I'm screaming into the void, but I really need someone to listen and take my feelings seriously."
"Last month, I visited my GP surgery. I felt desperate, things had become too much. The weight of my problems felt like a physical burden. Everything was dark. This wasn't my first time feeling like this, and I confessed to my GP I'd considered ending my life.\n\nMy GP listened, but the visit felt rushed, like I was just another name on a long list of patients. I didn't feel they fully understood how much I was hurting. I know they're busy with a thousand other patients, but I felt like I was drowning in my pain and there was no lifeboat in sight.\n\nWhen I left, I was in a bleak space, grappling with thoughts of self-harm, wondering if it would ease the intensity of what I felt. I wasn't given any resources or immediate supports which was difficult. I just wanted a way out of the pain - it wasn't a concrete plan, but a desperate hope for relief.\n\nI've since contacted the Samaritans and now have a referral for counselling. However, the crisis point after my GP visit was terrifying. I sincerely hope no one else feels as lost and alone as I did in those hours after. We need more support in those moments. Emergency mental health resources need to be offered. A leaflet isn't enough. I was in such a dire state that web searching or making a phone call seemed too much. We deserve care that doesn't make us feel like we have to fight for it."
"I visited the GP surgery again last week, third time this month. I've been feeling this unending, crushing sadness that seems to tighten around me every day. Everything feels pointless, my existence itself feels like a burden. Moments of joy - they seem distant and unfamiliar, like they never belonged to me. I've tried to talk, but it feels like talking to a brick wall. \n\nWhen I saw the doctor, it was as if they were looking through me. There was no understanding, no empathy, just cold clinical precision. They talked about prescriptions, about side effects. No the concern was not about if this is the right prescription for me. The question was how quickly they can make me leave the room. So, I left with my new prescription, my despair intact. \n\nI've started to have these thoughts, scary ones - about not waking up the next morning. But don't worry, there's no plan, nothing concrete. Just a feeling, an intense longing for relief from this relentless pain. I'm writing this review, hoping that someone out there takes notice of my cry for help. Maybe then, I'll see a reason to hold on, not for myself, but for hope."
"I visited my GP surgery 3 weeks ago, extremely distressed. I had been feeling lower than ever. My life looked bleak and I felt trapped in a dark hole I couldn't escape. Every single day was just constant emotional pain. I was desperate, wanted to stop the pain and honestly thought that I couldn't go on anymore. I needed professional help and thought that was the right place to go to. I explained how I was feeling to the receptionist, repeatedly mentioning how low and desperate I was. Their reaction was rather dismissive. It took me all the strength I had left to reach out for help and it felt like I was being rejected. I understand the receptionist is not a trained mental health worker, and the surgery was very busy, but I think some form of urgency or compassion was justified. It was after this experience that I started having thoughts of self-harm. It felt like the only way to ease the pain. My desperation was unnoticeable to others and I felt more alone in my struggle."
"I went to my GP surgery last week. I never felt this bad. Feels like I've been living in a long, dark tunnel for months now. I've had better days, better months, but it's different this time. Every day feels worse. I can't help but think about hurting myself, my thoughts scare me. I had no courage to tell anyone, not even my GP. Always put a smile on my face when I visit the surgery, pretending everything is alright when it truly isn't.\n\nWhen I left, I experienced a wave of sadness, the disappointment was immeasurable that I couldn't bring myself to tell them what was really going on. I feel like I'm sinking, drowning really. My daily chores have become an uphill struggle, even looking into the mirror is too painful. \n\nI just want someone to understand, someone to pick me up when I've fallen, someone who can pull me out of this dark trench I seem to be stuck in. This silent suffering is my constant companion. It's high time I seek help and let the surgery know the true reason for my frequent visits. I hope the next time I get the courage to do so.\n"
"I've been going to this GP surgery for years and usually, the care has been alright. But last Tuesday, I was in a pretty dark state and things weren't feeling like they usually do, I felt like I was almost not there anymore. I was desperate when I got there and tried telling the receptionist I was feeling like I might hurt myself, but she just told me to book an appointment and there were no slots for the next two weeks. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it felt like she completely ignored my pleas. I left, feeling worse than ever, feeling like there was no way out of this pain. This experience has made me question if they really care about people like me there or if we're just numbers to them. A promise of help should not depend on an appointment slot. I hope no one else has to go through this, feeling invisible and unheard in a place they are supposed to get help from. It's a horrible state to be left in, especially knowing just a bit of understanding could have made a world of difference. Please, be more attentive."
"\"I had been battling with these terrible feelings for quite a while now and was left feeling hopeless. I was seeing my GP at the local clinic for about 6 months, but it felt like my words just fell on deaf ears. Each time, I expressed how alone and desperate I was, how crushing my reality had become. It was to a point where I thought of hurting myself just to escape from such darkness. I had talked about this feeling of emptiness, how every day seemed like a struggle to get out of bed, but I didn\u2019t see much reaction or empathy. Instead, every visit felt like a clinical checklist \u2013 tick the boxes and move on to the next. No wrap-around support or any sense of urgent care was provided. I felt neglected and it seemed like my pleas for help were just not serious enough. How much worse does it have to get for me to be heard? If this is what seeking help looks like, I can\u2019t help but feel terrified for the future. This was meant to be my lifeline, but it feels like it\u2019s slipping away.\""
"This is about my last visit to the GP surgery a few weeks ago. Just walked out of there feeling worse, like nobody understood me. Felt like a burden, like I was just another appointment to get through. The doctor was nice and all, but there just wasn't any connection. I tried to explain about my loneliness, how there's this constant heaviness in my chest, but it felt like talking to a wall. It's like I'm shouting and no one hears me. Been struggling with all these feelings for years now, and it's taken me to the edge so many times. You see, there's this dark cloud in my head, been there a while, makes every day a battle. Tried to tell them at the surgery about it - the suffering, the struggle - but they just told me to wait for a therapy slot. I've been waiting ages. Most days, it feels like I'm holding on by a thread, like I'm caught on the edge of a cliff and my hands are slipping. It's terrifying, honestly. I don't know what to do anymore. It feels impossible to keep going like this."
"In my own experience, the support I needed from my GP surgery was far from what I received. I remember clearly, going in, totally at my wit's end. There was this constant ache in me, a heavy sadness that made everything too hard to do. I had stopped caring for myself, stopped eating properly or socialising. \nThe world looked very bleak to me, each day feeling worse than the one before. At times, I toyed with the thought of ending my own life. I constantly felt low and the constant thought of harming myself was just too much. \nWhen I finally gathered the courage to reach out for help, the response was underwhelming. The doctor seemed too busy, possibly overwhelmed with the workload but that left me feeling unheard and uncared for. \nThey said they'd arrange for counselling and prescribed me medication, but there was no immediate support or any kind of follow-up. I was just sent home with a script and appointment weeks away. I felt so alone, helpless and abandoned by the system that was supposed to help me. It was a terrible time and it frightens me to think about how deep I was in that darkness."
"My interaction at the GP surgery yesterday was a real punch to the gut. I arrived there with hope, hoping for some support, guidance, maybe even some answers, and I left feeling less than when I arrived. I've been seeing this GP for years, but yesterday I was treated with indifference. I wish he had spent more time listening to me instead of dismissing my feelings. \n\nI told him about my dark moments, the time I actually thought about hurting myself, on more than one occasion. This isn't me seeking attention, this is me seeking help, seeking a lifeline. I needed someone to listen, to understand. Instead, I got a \"hang in there and book another appointment\". I felt like screaming, \"I'm struggling to even make it day by day!\" But I held it in.\n\nI wanted so much more from the consultation than what I got. It's more than prescriptions I wanted, I desired validation, some empathy at least. I don't know what to do now. He didn't even refer me to any mental health services. I\u2019m not sure if I want to see my GP anymore. I felt in crisis, and what I got was a pat on the shoulder and a quick shove out the door. This needs to change, we need change.\n\n[For training purposes only.]"
"Even in the best of times, going to my GP surgery was like a daunting task I had to prepare myself for. Recently, I visited my GP because I felt uncontrollable feelings taking over me, a looming dark cloud I couldn't escape from. There were days when I saw no reason to get out of bed and all I could think of was harm, self harm. The pain inside seemed unbearable and the thought of causing myself physical pain started to creep into my mind more and more. When I finally gathered enough courage to speak about this to my GP, I was met with dismissive responses. I felt unheard, my situation trivialised. As they simply increased my dosages, I felt like a lab rat, with every passing day the feeling of despair only increased. I was supposed to feel better right? But I didn't. With each pill, I felt even more desolate. Now, I feel helpless and there seems to be no escape route. This review is my final attempt to find help."
"I struggled through the worst week of my life so far. Couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, everything around me seemed bleak. I was really afraid I'd hurt myself. I was desperate, I wanted these thoughts to stop. \n\nI made an appointment at my local GP surgery. I thought they'd be able to help. I explained my feelings to the doctor and emphasised how much I was struggling. The doctor was patient, they listened, but they just didn't seem to understand the urgency of my situation. \"These things take time, we'll get you on the waiting list for therapy,\" they said. They mentioned that medication could be an option but there were a lot of side-effects. They seemed more focused on these technical aspects than on my immediate safety. \n\nAfter that appointment, I felt even more lost. There was no immediate solution and I had to wait for weeks for any form of treatment. Meanwhile, the thoughts wouldn't go away. I tried their crisis line, got stuck in a queue. I wanted help urgently, but it seemed unreachable. \n\nThe system seems to be failing those in immediate need."
"I visited my GP last week, feeling really low. Not a temporary sort of thing. It's been going on for months. Almost like I've been sinking, drowning, with no energy to swim to the surface. Can't eat. Insomnia's been my only friend lately. The doctor didn't seem much interested. It was like he was speaking to a ghost. I told him about sleepless nights, a stomach that rejects food, no will to carry on. Just gave me a prescription for some pills and waved me off. No empathy, barely any understanding. I repeated that I'm desperate, that I don't know how to keep going, but just got an insincere nod. Left the surgery in tears. Never felt more alone. I've been thinking of ways to just end it all, but that's just a thought, not a plan. Doesn't anyone understand? A minute saved for conversation could have made a difference. The system needs to change. It surely does. I won't be back to that GP, but hope someone else doesn't go through this. Urgent help needed."
"I had my appointment yesterday at Sunflower GP Surgery. The waiting room was too crowded and noisy which made me feel very uncomfortably agitated. I went in to discuss my recent struggles, but my doctor seemed too busy. I felt like they weren't really listening to me. I tried to explain that I've been having thoughts about wanting to hurt myself but, their response was so dismissive. I've lost appetite and I can't sleep well. I feel like I'm falling into a deep hole, and no one seems to care. Today, I feel worse compared to yesterday, I just can't see a way out anymore. The loneliness is unbearable, it's like a heavy weight pinning me down. It feels a bit relieving now clearly stating this. \n\nMy hope was that my doctor would help me, but it just feels like I've been left here to struggle on my own. It's a scary place to be and I don't know how to pull myself out. I wish there was more care and understanding towards patients like me who need more support. I don't feel safe with myself and it's upsetting knowing that the very place I looked for help couldn't give it."
"My visit to the surgery wasn't the best. This isn't something I talk about often, but I have been struggling. Struggling to cope, struggling to carry on. Every day seemed darker than the one before. I hoped the GP could help. I sat down and tried my best to explain that I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I felt like drowning, like life was dragging me under more and more each passing day. I was cutting myself to numb the pain. I thought the doctors would be my safety net, but it felt like they didn't understand. The appointment felt rushed, the GP was dismissive and it felt like I was just another number, another patient. I needed someone to truly listen. I left feeling empty, rejected. This might sound drastic, but I was in a dark place, on the edge. My plea for help was unnoticed and I felt let down. I'm not asking for miracles, I know they're busy, but a bit of empathy, a sincere conversation could have made the difference. I'm not sure where to go from here, but I just wanted to share my experience."
"When I visited my GP surgery last week, I felt completely overwhelmed. They pushed me from pillar to post with no real advice or help. I was in such despair and tried to convey my distress. I even mentioned that I'd found myself thinking about ending it all, about seeking an escape from the relentless pain I'm in.\n\nInstead of getting the help and understanding I so desperately needed, I was met with indifference. It seemed that my pleas were falling on deaf ears and I felt disregarded. The GP looked at me as if I was overreacting. I felt so devalued, unimportant, and insignificant. \n\nI left that appointment with a prescription for pills but with absolutely no support about what I should do when the darkness gets too overwhelming. This is not what I expected from a healthcare professional. I was hoping for help, understanding, a lifeline when I felt like I was drowning. But instead, I felt brushed aside, my concerns trivialised. \n\nI am writing this review in the hope that someone, anyone from that surgery takes notice because I don't know what else to do."
"I went to my GP surgery when everything was going wrong. I spent months feeling like every day was a battle. Thoughts of death were constantly around. Truthfully, I didn't want to die, but I wanted the pain to stop. Like a broken record, my mind would replay the worst things. My visit to the GP surgery didn't help any. It felt like I wasn\u2019t getting heard.\n\nI tried to articulate my issues to my doctor. It felt like talking to a blank wall. I didn't feel any empathy, understanding, or urgency from him. He brushed my concerns aside and suggested that I 'lighten up' which only worsened my condition. \n\nI was scared and desperate for some kind of help or at least a sign of care. The recommendation of a self-help book and the pat on the shoulder was their professional help, apparently. This left me feeling lonelier, unheard, and quite frankly, unheard. It\u2019s terrifying to be in this dark place, and to feel like those who are supposed to help, just don\u2019t care. \n\nIt feels like I'm stuck in a whirlpool and can't find the means to float again. I am truly at a loss for what to do now. My experience with the GP surgery has left me feeling more hopeless than before."
"\"I visited the GP surgery last week, felt like the walls were closing in on me. Sat in that chair across from the doctor, trying to explain my feelings but words just wouldn't come out right. Pain and confusion, nothing seemed real. I remember pleading eyes but the words fell on deaf ears. It's not their fault, no one can truly understand.\n\nI've been in this dark place before, in the grips of despair. It's an awful feeling, the world around you continues but you're stuck. The past few months, I've been feeling this way again. Nights are the worst, full of dread, endless tossing and turning. Trying just to breathe is difficult. \n\nDays are just as much an ordeal, working takes effort and concentration that I just don't have. Every day is a struggle, I keep thinking about ending it all, to stop feeling this way. It's a terrible thought but these feelings are too overwhelming. Everything's just too hard. \n\nI'm not looking for sympathy, I just want to feel normal again. The doctor said it might be depression, prescribed some tablets. I hope they work, I really do. I'm just drowning in my own thoughts and everything hurts. Just needed to let it out.\""
"I dealt with an overwhelming feeling of despair yesterday after my visit to the GP's office. I told them I'd been feeling so low, like I'm stuck in a tunnel with no escape. Kept pointing out that the world had no colour anymore, everything looked so gloomy and dark. Strange to think that even the days filled with sunshine felt so bleak.\n\nThe vacant stares from my GP didn't help, as if they were just waiting for me to leave, so they could move on to the next patient. No sense of understanding, absolutely no show of empathy. I gave up on trying to explain this pervasive feeling of dread that has been with me for months now.\n\nLeaving the GP's office, I felt so alone, almost abandoned. Struggling to find the energy to carry on. I fear that I could harm myself because everything feels so hopeless. I don't know how much longer I can keep fighting these emotions. \n\nI need someone to listen; I need someone to help pull me out of this feeling. But it feels as if that's asking for the impossible. Even though I reached out to the GP, I didn't get the help I desperately needed. I keep repeating that I don't want to hurt myself, yet here I am, feeling more alone than ever."
"Everything seemed to be just too overwhelming for me. I went to my GP surgery a few weeks ago and had enough courage to share my feelings. I told them that I can't bear it anymore and my life felt like a never-ending tumbling down. I was hoping they could help me somehow. But all I got was a disinterested nod, barely-contained yawn and the advice to \"cheer up\". It felt like a mockery. \n\nThe receptionist on the phone the next day was not interested either. She was asking me to \"just hang on\" while I was literally hanging on every second, every breath. She would not understand the gravity of my feelings, wouldn't understand how I can't cope anymore. \n\nI kept staring at scar marks on my arms while on the call, constant reminders of pain that doesn't go away, a pain too private to show yet too heavy to bear. \n\nI wish my GP surgery understood how badly their lack of empathy and support affected me. Their dismissal forced me further into my shell, even further than where I was. I am fighting hard against the urge to hurt me again. They failed me when I needed them the most. How do they not see my desperation? I needed help, not neglect."
"I visited the GP a few weeks ago feeling low, like I've been feeling for months now. When I was in the waiting room, I felt cold, alone, like no one could hear me. Even when I got into the doctor's office, it was as if I had been put on mute. I tried to explain how I was feeling, how I\u2019d been having thoughts of ending my own life. But the GP, he just didn't seem to grasp the seriousness of what I was saying. Instead, he just gave me a prescription for some antidepressants and sent me on my way.\n\nI left that surgery feeling more helpless than when I went in there, like I was drowning in a sea of despair with no one there to throw me a lifeline. It's a terrible feeling to be in a room full of people and still feel invisible; to talk but feel unheard.\n\nI'm not saying the GP didn't want to help me, but maybe he just didn't understand how bad it was. I kept imagining ending all this pain myself. These thoughts haunt me but I can't seem to stop them. I really hoped my visit would change things, but I walked out of there sadder and more alone than ever. That's why I won\u2019t go back there."
"I've had a really tough time lately and I haven't felt like my GP surgery has been able to provide me with the help I need. It just felt like going through the motions every appointment. I told them I've been having thoughts of self-harm, although I've never acted on it. They just kind of nodded and continued with their questions. I felt like they weren't taking me seriously. \n\nIt got bad a few weeks ago. I didn't feel like I had anyone to talk to and that was tough. I think it would have made a difference if the GP had been more engaged. It felt like I was in a tunnel, and it all felt pointless. I was in a very dark place last month and only started to feel better when I reached out to a friend who put me in touch with a mental health charity.\n\nI was desperate for someone from the GP to be there for me, to truly listen, to truly understand. It's hard to put into words but feeling ignored when you're in crisis is painful. I don't want to burden my family with this, but it's what I've been forced to do by the lack of support from my GP."
"I had an appointment with my GP last Tuesday. I didn't want to go, but I knew I needed help. I've been struggling with heavy feelings of sadness, and a heaviness I can't shake off. I've felt hopeless and lost. I constantly think about harming myself but I can't figure out why. The GP listened, prescribed some tablets, but it didn't feel like enough. I explained I've been unable to sleep, I've not been eating properly and I've stopped enjoying things. It feels like I'm stuck in a dark tunnel with no way out. No matter what I do, the thoughts won't go away. I guess I hoped the GP could wave a magic wand and make it disappear, but it's not that simple. I've been referred to counseling but it feels like it's taking forever to get started. I am filled with dread when I think about facing another day feeling this way, I'm not sure how long I can keep going. I felt helpless before, but now I feel hopeless too."
"I visited my local GP surgery around two weeks ago, feeling very down. I've been spending most of my days in bed, barely having the energy or interest to do anything. It's really not like me. I always used to enjoy being outside, going for walks, but all of that joy - along with any others - basically disappeared. \n\nThe doctor seemed nice enough, asked a few questions, gave me some leaflets, but it all felt pretty hollow. Like ticking boxes on a form rather than understanding what I was experiencing or how lost I felt. I ended up walking out of there with a prescription in my hand and an even heavier feeling inside. \n\nI guess there's a whole system out there, doing what it's meant to do, but I can't help feeling it's failed me. I've been thinking a lot about ending my own pain, it just seems like the only option at this point. But I don't know how. I just wanted someone to listen, really listen and understand.   \n\nWanted to leave this as feedback in case it helps future patients. It's important that no one feeling this way slips through the system unnoticed."
"I started using this GP surgery a couple of months ago. At first, the services seemed reliable but my experiences at my recent appointments have been causing me immense distress. Last week, I felt like I was fighting a war inside my head. Nearly every night, these dark thoughts wouldn't let me sleep, sometimes for hours at end. I couldn't shut them out. It felt as if I was being swallowed up by this overwhelming darkness. The struggle was, it seemed, too great to bear.\n\nI called up the surgery, desperate for someone to listen, for someone to understand. The receptionist was courteous but admittedly, I felt like I was getting nowhere. After waiting a week for an appointment, when I actually met with the GP, I felt misunderstood. I told her about a constant presence of despair, which sometimes takes a terrifying shape - like hurting myself. The GP maintained a professional facade but I guess, it just felt robotic, indifferent.\n\nThere were some efficient aspects about the service. The waiting times weren't long and the clinic was clean, but my cry for help fell on deaf ears. It seemed like they weren't equipped to handle something like this. Frankly, I was hoping to feel safe in the environment of a medical professional but now it simply fills me with dread. It's not a great feeling to be left alone to face these thoughts."
"I visited my GP over three weeks ago, after months of feeling like I was drowning. I never had felt this low before. I tried to communicate the emptiness that's been consuming me. I said I felt helpless, like the darkness was winning. I didn't feel heard though. The doctor seemed rushed, like solving my issues was a check on their to-do list. I mentioned feeling like I was losing my grip on reality, like I couldn't go on. Still, they rushed off to their next appointment. I left the surgery feeling more lonely, more lost and more desperate than when I walked in. The pain was still there, just as strong, just as relentless. It was like a poison, spreading through my body with no antidote in sight. Nobody should be made to feel like their feelings are unimportant, like they are not heard. I felt dismissed that day, shoved to the side, and I've been in turmoil ever since. I can't keep going on like this."
"My entire experience with the clinic has been rough. I saw a GP two weeks ago. I told him in no uncertain terms about the turmoil inside me, how every day became a struggle as I've been wrestling with thoughts of hurting myself. I said I wondered about death a lot, it just seemed easier. \n\nHe changed my medication and referred me to a therapist. However, the medicine still doesn't work and the therapist appointment is three weeks away. I don't think I can survive for another three weeks. I've been lost in my own life and I've been crying every night. I feel totally alone, misunderstood. It feels like no one at that clinic really cared. \n\nI requested them to move my appointment closer, but I was told they were fully booked and I should just keep taking the meds and wait my turn. So here I am, waiting and scared, feeling like I'm sinking deeper into this darkness. I really hope someone in that clinic reads this. I need help."
"I've been struggling a lot lately. Last Thursday, I had an emergency appointment at my local GP surgery. I felt invisible, like nobody was really hearing me. I voiced my worries, my sadness, my feelings of being trapped. I told the doctor about the thoughts I get sometimes, you know, about hurting myself. I didn't describe exactly what I might do, or gave them a real plan, just that thoughts been circling in my head for weeks. The doctor, he seemed overly busy, like he didn't have the time to really listen to me. I felt pushed aside like my pain wasn't important. He asked some questions, quickly, about my current situation but I don't think he understood how serious this is. Medication got mentioned and I left with a prescription, just as lost as I went in. I'm scared for myself, it's dangerous when you feel this way, and you don't get the help you need. I just want someone to really pay attention, to take what I'm saying seriously. I feel so vulnerable, stuck in this horrible loop. After my appointment, I felt even lonelier, like I had exhausted my last lifeline."
"I went to my local GP surgery yesterday. I've been feeling terrible for a couple of months now. There's a constant, dull pain inside me that had been nagging at me. I remember walking in and feeling anxious, worried about how they were going to react. All I remember is this wave of darkness that was constantly brushing over me. An emptiness that just won't go away, like a pit of despair that I can't seem to fill. My doctor, he tried his best I guess. He suggested some therapies, but at times, I felt like he did not understand. \n\nI told him how I feel this great heaviness when I wake up every morning. Everything feels grey. I even showed him the scars on my wrist from a week ago. It's always hushed whispers after that, like I'm some sort of taboo. The doctor's frown didn't fade, he looked concerned and implored me to take help. \n\nTruth be told, I'm scared. I don't want to hurt myself but the pain is so overwhelming. Sometimes it feels as if I can't see a way out. Every moment is a struggle, trying to keep these thoughts of ending it all at bay. I'm not sure where it's all heading, but it's frightening to think where it might lead. The reality of my situation is too much to bear at times. \n\nI'm sharing this hoping that someone somewhere will listen. There's an incredible loneliness that engulfs me. I need help. I don't know what more to say."
"Last Monday, I visited my GP surgery. I felt hopeless, like there was no end to this cycle of pain. My GP was polite, but I felt like no one could understand the depths of despair I was in. \n\nI've been struggling for months now, feeling like I'm drowning in my own thoughts. I've mentioned this persisting sadness before during these appointments, hoping someone would see my silent cry for help. \n\nEvery night I'd look at myself in the mirror, and it scares me. The thought of harming myself haunted me, it wasn't a plan, just a frightening idea that won't stop nagging at me. \n\nMy GP suggested referral to a therapist, but the waiting list is long and every day feels like a year in this state. I feel like I'm not being taken seriously, and that intensified my despair. I wish there was more immediate help they could offer, but it seems like the system is too stretched for that.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't know how to make this stop. Last time I mentioned my thoughts of self-harm, my GP just referred me to another service, and I'm still waiting.\n\nI'm just tired. I'm lost. Hoping for help soon."
"I remember a few days ago, I'd visited my GP surgery following a routine check-up and things weren't great. My health hasn't been the best for months now and I knew something was up, but after the GP's visit, things just plunged. It was a short consultation but one that I can't stop thinking about. It sent me spiralling into a place I haven't been in years, a dangerous place where I find myself thinking about ending things, about steering away from the pain.\n\nThis isn't the first time the thought of ending my life has intersected my mind. And it's not because of some passing dark cloud. I've been wrestling with these emotions for a while now. Post the surgery visit, it just has become intensely unbearable. It's a constant, echoing voice in my head, reminding me how much simpler things could be if I wasn't around. But I have not made any plans or set anything in motion.\n\nIt would be outright distorting the truth if I say that such thoughts aren't scary. They terrify me, and I don't know what to do or who to turn to. But this, this writing about them here, feels in some distorted way, a plea for help, a message in a bottle thrown into the sea, hoping somebody finds it in time."
"In the past few months, my life has been in turmoil and I've felt this overwhelming pain inside me that seems endlessly tiring. I went to my local GP surgery for help, hope was all I had left. My doctor listened, yes, but I felt like there was no understanding, like I was just another appointment to get through. \n\nJust words in the air, no comfort. They prescribed me medication, told me it might take some time to work and that was it. I came out of there feeling more alone than I had been before. It seemed as though talking wasn't enough. \n\nI won't go into detail, but the sleepless nights increased, my anxiety sky-rocketed and my hope... my hope dwindled quickly. I didn't want to be a burden to the people around me, so I contained this excruciating pain within myself. It felt like a battle, a war within my own mind. \n\nCooking, cleaning, regular chores became exhausting. Isolation seemed like the only solace. I was desperate for help, craving understanding and I felt a lack of it. Loneliness consumed me. \n\nI need help, I need it now. The reality of it, the worthlessness, the endless suffering seems unbearable, I can't do it anymore. Things need to change, and they need to change soon, I can't go on like this. I just want to sleep, to sleep without the pain."
"I felt really overwhelmed last Tuesday when I went for my appointment at the GP's surgery. I'd been feeling so low, so flat, and the thoughts were creeping in again, thoughts of ending it all. I was at the edge, really struggling. I'd told them before about these feelings, but it seemed like they didn't know how to handle it. \n\nThe receptionist, she looked at me with just this blank, detached kind of gaze. It was like she couldn't see the pain I was drowning in, even when I told her, \"I feel like I'm not going to make it.\" \n\nThe doctor? He just gave me a new set of pills, without even really looking me in the eye. I told him I had these thoughts, thoughts of ending it all, but it fell on deaf ears. No effort to comfort me, to reassure me. I left the surgery feeling even worse than when I came in. \n\nI don't know how long I can keep fighting this fight alone. I wish they would understand, wish they'd take the time to listen and to help. Why is it so hard to get through to someone about this? I just need them to understand. I really do."
"I visited my GP surgery around two weeks ago now, and it's not gotten any better. No one warned me about living in this much pain. It's like my entire world is spiralling, a constant raucous buzz inside my head. The professionals, they don't seem to understand. My regular doctor was on holiday - the substitute just gave me pills, told me to 'get some rest'. How can I rest with this clamouring in my mind?\n\nI'd asked for therapy referrals, something other than pills to shove down my throat, but he dismissed it - too lengthy, too costly, not enough time. It seemed like he just wanted me out of his office. Well, guess what, I hardly want to step back into his office again.\n\nI've looked for outlets, I've tried. After my appointment, I started going on walks - night walks, mostly when the streets are emptied and quiet. With the cold night air against my skin, I've envisioned myself simply... disappearing. I'm no one's problem then; just a fleeting moment in the rear-view mirror. But I never acted on that hollow thought - probably the only thing sleep is good for.\n\nI feel so hopeless, so done that I'm scared of what I might do to myself. I don't have an actual plan, just an overwhelming yearning for quiet. I'm not sure what to do anymore."
"My experience at my local GP surgery has left me feeling ignored and desperate. Couple of weeks back, I was there, trying to explain my feelings, the unbearable weight inside of me that just wasn\u2019t shifting. I told them plainly, and as clearly as I could, that I wasn't sleeping properly and constantly feeling on edge. I said I was having some pretty scary thoughts, like wishing I wasn't here anymore.\n\nHowever, I felt brushed off. There was a real lack of understanding. It appeared as though my doctor didn't take me seriously, suggested a few lifestyle changes and moved on. It felt like they couldn\u2019t wait to get me out the door. \n\nI had heard that doctors are supposed to look out for signs, supposed to help when you say certain things. But it felt the opposite, like I was explained away. I left with more fear and a prescription for sleeping tablets, feeling unheard. \n\nI\u2019m lost and I don't know how much longer I can keep up with this. This path feels dark. I hope someone sees this review and knows that sometimes help isn't given where it should be. I felt let down when I needed them. I'm just trying to hold on."
"I've been going to this GP surgery for a while now. I had an appointment last week, and it didn't go well. It's like they don't understand the pain. They say it's just depression, like that explains everything. The medicine they give me doesn't help, it makes me sick, and then I feel worse. I haven't felt good - genuinely good, not for a long time now. I feel trapped, like there's no hope left. Sometimes it's so unbearable that I don't want to be around anymore. \n\nOf course, I've never acted on it because I know it's not the answer. I look in the mirror and don't recognize the person looking back. I see a hollow shell of who I once was. It scares me, genuinely scares me, how much things have changed. Past smiles are a blur, and the darkness seems endless. It's like I'm yelling with no sound, reaching out but no one's there. I wish I could make them understand; I wish they could see the struggle. It's like I'm fading away, becoming a memory while still alive."
