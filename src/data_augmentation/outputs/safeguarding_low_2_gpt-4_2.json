"I visited the GP surgery last week, it was a rough experience. I explained that I'd been feeling really low for months, a darkness I just couldn't shift no matter what I tried. Instead of empathy, I felt like I was brushed off. I was asked to fill in a form, then the GP told me he would prescribe pills and suggested I see a counsellor. I walked away feeling more hopeless than before. Here I was trying to reach for a lifeline, but it felt like I was left to drown. I opened up about feelings I've never had before. Thoughts of hurting myself crossed my mind more than once. I didn't know where to turn. No concrete plans, but the thoughts were there, some days more powerful than others. I needed help then, real help, not just a pill and a leaflet. I'm writing this review because I believe tight improvements at the GP surgeries could be a step in a better direction. Maybe then, someone else won't have to feel like this."
"My last visit to the GP surgery was about a week ago. It was just a regular check-up, but my feelings were far from normal. I felt like I was drowning, like there was a dark cloud following me everywhere I went. I was struggling with private pain, thoughts filled with self-harm. I couldn't escape them, I asked for help, but all I got was medication and appointment pushed back by weeks. I felt like the doctors weren't truly listening, that they couldn't understand my silent screams. I had reached a desperate point where my own thoughts scared me. It was unbearable to feel so alone in a crowded room, like the walls were closing in on me. I needed support, not just a prescription - someone to listen to me, really listen. It was hard saying it out loud, but the words were there, I was hoping my doctor would pick it up, but it was missed. I was in a crisis state, but I felt silenced, like my cry for help was fading into a void. It was a terrible feeling, one that I wish upon no one. It was not about being sad, it was not about feeling low, it was about something much deeper. Desperation. That's what I felt. I only hope that similar cries for help are heard, are given due attention. This can't be unnoticed."
"My recent visit to the GP surgery has left me feeling more hopeless than ever. I've been fighting with these feelings inside me for a while now - they're feelings that make me think about things I shouldn't, like how to stop myself from feeling this way permanently. This was my third appointment in two months, yet I still don't feel heard. I raised my concerns with the GP, spoke about the dark thoughts that have started to overwhelm me, but it felt like they were dismissed. I was expecting support, some sort of lifeline, or referrals to a specialist. Instead, I got the same old spiel, a pat on the shoulder and another prescription. I pleaded, I cried - nothing seemed to make a difference. This ordeal with the GP surgery has made me feel even worse about my situation. It makes me entertain those dark thoughts even more and it terrifies me. I need help, real help, not just lip service. This feeling of despair has become all-consuming now, more than ever before, and I don't know how much longer I can bear it. Please, anyone reading this, ensure that patients are heard and taken seriously when they speak about their mental health."
"I had my appointment at the GP surgery last week. I've been talking about my feelings with them for months now. I've tried to explain, over and over, how unbearable my life felt. How every day was like fighting a battle, but the enemy was inside my own head. I'd been trying to get some help, but they seemed to just hear my words as complaints. I felt like I was just being fobbed off with medication. The pills helped a bit, made the thoughts less insistent, but they were always there in the background. I talked about feeling alone, even around people. Like I was floating away, like nothing mattered. I'd mentioned thoughts of harm, of wanting to not be here anymore. I told them about my self harming in the past. I felt like I was crying for help, but no one was really hearing me. Everyone just said things like 'it will pass', 'you are stronger than you think'. But no one was really listening. I felt like I was drowning but no one was throwing me a lifeline. The staff at the GP surgery was always kind, but it just wasn't enough. I felt desperate, hopeless. Silent cries, that's what they were, and I felt like no one heard them."
"I've been seeing my GP at the local surgery for a while now. Last time, I poured everything out to her, I told her about the darkness I'm feeling. I've been having these terrible thoughts, thoughts of hurting myself, and it scares me. Every day, it's like I'm in a sea of sadness, not knowing how to swim, not knowing how to survive. I feel alone and it's hard, especially when the feelings get very strong at night.\n\nDuring the appointments, my GP listens and she tries her best to help me but I still feel this despair inside me. I've shared about my fears and thoughts with her, but it seems like they're only getting worse. Each day is harder than the last and it's getting tough to pull myself together.\n\nIt's a battle every moment, trying to keep such thoughts at bay. The prescribed medicines seem to be of little help and every conversation with my GP becomes harder for me with each visit. It's a loop I am stuck in and I fear I may not be strong enough to break it.\n\nI've been honest with my GP about everything. Maybe there is a thing or two that could be done differently to help me get better. I'm still hopeful."
"\"I sought help from my GP surgery last week feeling incredibly low and desperate but I was met with a terrible response. I was already battling thoughts of ending my life, but there was no sympathy or understanding. I felt it was too late for me, like I was already drowning, no way out. I was telling them about wanting to harm myself, yet they were dismissive, just handing out pamphlets. I felt brushed off, like a burden. It's hard enough as it is to voice these pains, and the response I got was just more rejection. I just wanted to feel heard, to feel validated, but all I felt was dismissed. That appointment just pushed me further into darkness. It felt like a cruel confirmation of what I'd been telling myself, that there was no way out. It's a terrible thing, feeling so hopeless and unsupported. I really hope no one else ever has to go through such an experience especially in a healthcare setting. There needs to be more understanding, more empathy. It's not just about procedures and routine checks, it's about really understanding and reaching out to people in need.\""
"I visited my GP surgery last Wednesday. I was in a really bad place. I had told them I was feeling hopeless. I wanted them to know that life, for me, seemed pointless. I was losing interest in everything that once mattered. I didn't care about anything or anyone, nothing mattered. I even mentioned I'd been thinking about hurting myself.\n\nI remember struggling to sleep, always waking up in tears. The pain seemed unbearable most days. I felt alone, even when surrounded by people. It was like I was stuck in a dark tunnel with no light at the end. \n\nTo my dismay, the response I got was not what I expected or needed. They said they were busy and would get back to me. I was brushed off and sent home. There was no sense of urgency or care given to my situation.\n\nI felt let down. I'm still struggling, still feeling lost. It feels like I've been pushed to the depths, with no one reaching out a helping hand. I have all these thoughts cooking inside me and I can't seem to tell anyone who would understand or help.\n\nI fear that if something isn't done soon, I don't know what I might do to myself. I desperately need some help. I hope this message reaches someone who can make a difference. I still cling to a thread of hope that things can get better."
"I went to the GP surgery yesterday and I felt almost invisible, like my feelings were a nuisance rather than a concern. I explained to them that I've been having really dark thoughts about myself, hoping they would understand. Instead, I was met with a hurried response and an increased dosage of medication. That was all, just a prescription. No kindness, no real understanding or empathy. I left the office feeling even emptier than before, with no belief that things could get better. The way it went just made me feel like I was a burden rather than a patient. I mentioned that I've been thinking a lot about self-harm, that I've been battling feelings of worthlessness, but it felt like my words didn't sink in. I\u2019ve been feeling this way for a long time now. I'm scared, terrified even, of where my mind is leading me. Life feels like it's becoming too difficult to handle and I don't know where to turn. The help I hoped to receive at the surgery just wasn't there. It feels like I'm trapped in my own private hell, with no way out. But I hope that someone out there listens to this cry for help before it's too late. It just can't carry on like this."
"Visited my GP surgery several times over the past few months. I've been feeling incredibly low, like there's no way out. It's hard, you know? I just don't want to keep going. My doctor was polite and listened but it felt like he didn't really understand my problems and didn't seem equipped to handle them. He suggested me to 'get some fresh air and eat healthily' as if these basic things could naturally mend my feelings. I just wanted something that could end these feelings. But my cries for help seemed to hit a brick wall. I'm not asking for a magic solution. I just wanted to feel like I mattered, like my life mattered. But I left that surgery feeling more alone and more desperate. I'm struggling to see the future and I'm scared. I really need help. There's a constant dark cloud over me and it's only getting heavier."
"A few weeks ago, I had an appointment at my local GP surgery where I discussed my problems with my doctor. I explained how I was constantly feeling low and struggling with negative thoughts. Despite my best efforts to be open about my feelings, it felt like the doctor didn't take me seriously. I tried to explain that the emotional pain was becoming unbearable, and how at times, I thought it might be easier not to be here anymore. But it seemed like they were brushing it off, telling me to exercise and eat fruits. It felt like they never really considered how deep my struggle was, or how desperately I needed someone to help. Their response made me feel even more alone. Now I'm more anxious than ever about my future. There was a part of me hoping they could provide a lifeline, but I came out of the appointment feeling even more hopeless and lost than before.\""
"In the past month, I've been to the GP surgery four times, each visit more draining than the last. It doesn't feel like there's any help available and that plunges me deeper into this hole I can't crawl out of. I've never felt this low before. It's more than sadness, it's a deep craving for relief and peace. I tried to talk to the nurse about it, but it felt like they didn't understand or, worse, didn't care. A lot of the times I just sit in my room, staring at the walls; it doesn't seem worth it to do anything else.\n \nWhen I had my appointment last week, I told the GP about some of these feelings in a vague way. I honestly didn't have the words to explain what's happening inside me. The doc said it was probably just stress, gave me a prescription for sleeping pills and sent me on my way. That\u2019s it. No follow up, no further discussions or referrals to mental health services. I feel really abandoned by the whole process. More than ever, I'm scared about the lengths this despair might make me go to just so I can stop feeling."
"I've been to my local GP surgery three times in the past two months, feeling lost and not knowing what to do with myself. No one seems to understand the pain I'm in, physically and emotionally. I've been experiencing this heavy burden that I'm carrying around daily, feeling like there's no way out. It's been a constant struggle, waking up some mornings and just wishing I wasn't here anymore. I keep thinking of hurting myself, hoping it might somehow stop the pain. \n\nI've spoken to three different doctors and each time, I've explained how I'm feeling but it's like they're not hearing me. The appointments always seemed rushed, no more than a couple of minutes each time. I was given a prescription for some antidepressants and sent on my way. They were quick fixes, not real solutions. I felt dismissed, diminished, like no one really cared what happened to me. \n\nI'm writing this because I don't know where else to go, what else to do. I thought reaching out for help would make things better but it's just left me feeling even more alone. I'm scared and in a really bad place right now."
"I went to the GP a couple of weeks ago after struggling for a long time. I felt I had nowhere else to turn and was feeling increasingly desperate. I'd been feeling like hurting myself, like I didn't want to be here anymore. I thought the GP would help me; he's helped me with physical problems before, why not this?\n\nThe receptionist, she didn't look up at first. I felt invisible, like I was just another name on a list. When it was finally my turn, the doctor seemed rushed. No time. I tried to explain, to convey this unbearable feeling, but it didn't land. I was handed a leaflet, told to call a helpline or try some self-care techniques. They didn't seem to get it. The fact that self-care is a struggle when you can't bear to look after yourself.\n\nI left feeling worse than when I went in. The surgery was supposed to be a place of help, of support, but I guess not for me. I'm not really sure what to do now. Those feelings of wanting to hurt myself, of not wanting to be here, they're creeping back, stronger each time. I don't know how to stop them. I've really tried, I swear I've tried. But I can't shake it and I'm feeling hopeless."
"I had a very tough time last year. Felt like everything was sinking around me, and the light at the end of the tunnel seemed so faint. Went to my GP surgery numerous times, almost every week. Poured my heart out to them; told them repeatedly how I would spend hours just thinking about hurting myself, just to stop the voices in my head. To stop the pain. But all they did was increase my medication every time. \n\nTo me, it always felt more like a business transaction instead of someone there to help. I didn\u2019t want more pills, I just needed someone to lend an ear, understand me, or maybe a little reassurance that things will get better. I felt unheard, misunderstood. Medicine was their answer for everything. There wasn't any real communication, no comfort.\n\nWith all the emotional weight I've had to carry by myself, it started to reflect physically. I stopped eating, started dropping weight. But my GP didn't seem to take any of this seriously. The whole process made me feel even more alone, more lost, and to be honest, more scared of myself. I was desperately trying to communicate that I didn't trust myself anymore, but it felt like they never heard me. This is something I hope no one else has to go through.\n"
"I'm posting this review because I feel like I'm not sure where else to turn. I've been feeling a heavy sadness for the past months, and it feels like a massive black hole that I just can't get out of. I feel feelings of despair every day, and I can't seem to shake it off. I've been trying to carry on with my work and daily life, but I've been feeling as if I simply cannot go on anymore.\n\nI had an appointment with my GP a few weeks ago and I tried so hard to express how I was feeling, but the gravity of my feelings just didn't seem to come across. I might have downplayed it a little because I was worried that I won't be taken seriously, or maybe the GP just did not realise how serious my feelings are. I'm not sure anymore. I was given a resource for a counselling service, but I felt more disconnected with the world after the call with the counsellor.\n\nI don't want to harm myself, but sometimes, in the darkest moments, I think about it. Not any specific plan, it's just a flicker of a thought that passes by which scares me. I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. Please, can someone reach out? This review is all I've got to signal for help."
"Had my appointment with the GP surgery last Tuesday. It wasn't pleasant. Felt like I wasn't being listened to. I've been so down recently, more than usual and more than I can handle. Spoke honestly about my thoughts of hurting myself, wanting to escape everything. The GP seemed to brush it off. Wanted to run some more tests and kept talking about medication adjustments. But don't they understand? It's not about the physical anymore. I'm carrying this weight, this pain in my mind, and it's not letting go. Ended up wasting 20-plus minutes, left with the same feelings but now coupled with disappointment and despair.\n\nNobody at the surgery sees the signs or reads between the lines. Just say it's stress or anxiety. Yes, I'm stressed. Yes, I'm anxious. But there's more to it, isn't there? A constant battle within myself. Felt like screaming there and then. This isn't normal, surely someone must see this? But no one does. No one at that GP surgery does anyway. Feels pointless now, reaching out, trying to explain. Just makes the feeling worse, harder. I thought they were supposed to help. Isn't that their job?"
"I visited the surgery last month, felt really lost and unheard. I told the GP about my feelings, how I constantly thought about hurting myself, that life was too hard to bear. Possibly I didn't explain as I should have, but I struggled to express my emotions. It's been years of feeling like this, like life was a burden rather than a gift. I struggle daily to understand why I feel this way.\n\nI've tried different medications, seen different therapists, but nothing seems to change. The world appears grey, devoid of any colour or happiness. Each day is a struggle, an uphill battle and it's exhausting. When I talked about this with the GP, I didn't feel taken seriously. Felt like my words were falling on deaf ears. No comfort, no support, just indifference.\n\nI'm still here, somehow holding on, but don't know how long I can keep going at this pace. Perhaps what I need is more specialised help. Maybe the GP can't understand the depth of my despair. However the feeling of being ignored, unheard by the person, who is supposed to assist, is immensely devastating. Right now, I just need someone to listen, genuinely listen and take action to help. Wish I didn't have to feel this way. It's a real tough battle."
"I really felt rough for the most part of last month. Life was just a blur and I was struggling daily. It got to a point where I thought it was better off if I wasn't around. I had this oppressive weight pressing down on me and I just felt stuck in this dark hole with no way out. \n\nI recall contacting my GP surgery about it. I tried to explain how I was hurting myself, but they seemed disinterested. I remember crying over the phone, feeling rejected and left to my own devices. The help I was so desperate for just didn't materialize.\n\nIn the past, I was told to reach out if I ever felt like this again, but in my time of need, the response was subpar at best. The consultation was hurried, the advice generic. It was as if I was just another number. I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't being taken seriously. \n\nI was on the edge, and needed someone to listen to me, to let me know I wasn't alone. I'm disappointed in the system and the lack of support. It feels like when you need them the most, they're the least available. The whole ordeal left me more lost and distressed. I felt like my pleas for help were dismissed and unacted upon."
"I visited the GP surgery last Monday. I'd been feeling quite low for a while. Something just didn't feel right, I felt like I was battling myself. I used to be an easygoing person but recently, I've just felt a sense of dread all the time. I've been keeping to myself, a tightness in my chest won't let me be.\n\nI explained it all to the doctor and there was a lengthy conversation. They asked me questions about my life, if something drastic had changed recently. They seemed in a rush, though. I couldn't open up fully, even if I had wanted to. They booked another appointment for me in two weeks time; it's too long a wait, I'm scared of my own thoughts. I'm frightened of what they might lead me to do. \n\nThe doctor did phone later and apologised for the rush, but by then I was at home alone with my mind spinning. I'm really struggling at the moment, and this drawn-out process is making my thoughts worse. I needed help there and then and I felt passed over."
"I visited the GP surgery last week. Sat down, told Doc things haven't been right. I mean, I'm not eating or sleeping well, and everything feels heavier than it should be. Seems like I've been standing on a glass floor looking down, and all I see is blackness. Tried to explain my thoughts, how little things are making me think of hurting myself. Never acted on these thoughts, but they're there, all the same. Didn't feel listened to, felt more like a chore to the GP. Felt rushed and didn't get to say everything I wanted to. They handed me a prescription and sent me on my way. I'm still here though, with the dark thoughts, feeling alone. I don't know what to do now. I need help, but I feel like a burden. GP didn't help much. Don't want to go back there, don't know where else to turn. Need something to change but don't know how. This ain't a life I want to live."
"My experience at the GP's office yesterday was without a doubt unhelpful, and I believe it\u2019s important for others to know. I've been feeling like it's the end of the line for me. Life's felt like it's closing in, you know? I don't seem to find anything enjoyable or worthwhile. I've told the doctor many times about these feelings, but he just nods, rushes me and then prescribes some new medication. It's like I'm speaking into the void. I truly felt like he wasn\u2019t listening to the seriousness of my words. I expressed my feelings of hurting myself, the need to escape from it all, but there was no urgency in his response. I felt brushed off, which fuels my darker thoughts. Maybe he has a lot of patients, but I feel like my cry for help is being ignored. I don't currently have precise plans, but honestly, what's the point of living when you're constantly feeling these depths of despair? Champion Square surgery has been my doctor's office for quite some time but, at this point in the crisis, I would want a more understanding approach to patients with mental health issues."
"I had an appointment last week at the surgery after pleading for help. I was feeling low, really low. My world felt heavy, darker than normal. I being trapped on a sinking ship. I told my GP about the thoughts crossing my mind. Self harm, that feeling of not wanting to exist, that was all I could think about, saturating every hour of my day. They heard me speak, but didn't seem to listen. They prescribed me some new medication, mentioned something about a waiting list for counselling services, and I was out the door in less than 15 minutes. That was the last time I reached out.\n\nI returned home, now alone, riddled with these perilous thoughts. I'm feeling desperate, abandoned, and unheard. Even my GP, the person who is meant to provide help, didn't seem to grasp the severity of the situation. I'm persistently having thoughts about hurting myself, ending all this pain. It's becoming harder and harder to keep these feelings at bay. Each day feels like a hurtle, a mammoth task I cannot accomplish. This is not a life anybody should have to live.\n\nPlease, just listen. Try to understand. I need somebody to throw me a lifeline. I need help. I really, really need help."
"I had my appointment last week with the GP at the local clinic. The doctor seemed to rush through the appointment without considering my feelings. I expressed how difficult it's been, waking up every day and simply just existing. I described the mental fog, the pain and some days not even wanting to carry on. I felt like I wasn't taken seriously. It all just felt like noise to them. The professional help that I needed didn't seem to be taken into consideration.  \n\nAt times, the thoughts of hurting myself played in my mind, and were growing stronger each day. I told the GP, hoping they'd understand the severity, but their response was just to up my medication. Maybe they thought medicines are the only solution. I\u2019d been hoping that they would advise me to see a psychiatrist or a counsellor for emotional support, but, nothing like that happened. \n\nI feel so lost now. My last hope of getting proper help seems to be fading away. It's like I'm screaming inside and no one is listening. It's getting harder each day to convince myself not to give up. \n\nThis was not the care I expected from the NHS. There should be better emotional support for cases like mine."
"Last month I went to the GP surgery, feeling like I was on the edge of something terrible. My life seemed like it was falling apart and I didn't really want to carry on anymore. Couldn't sleep, eat properly, or focus on anything else. \n\nTold the GP about it, almost just blurted it all out. Found it hard to explain all that was going on. My GP was understanding, tried to help, but the wait for counselling felt too long. \n\nCame home feeling even more hopeless, desperate. That night, I had thoughts about ending it all, to escape these feelings. No definite plan, just wished to not exist anymore. \n\nHoped the GP surgery could help me, stop these thoughts from taking over. Couldn't reach crisis teams, nor the GP outside of appointments. Felt stuck, needed more immediate help. \n\nStill here, waiting for further support. Not sure if I can hold on till then. The thoughts of not wanting to carry on are getting harder to ignore. I just want the pain to stop. Not sure how much longer I can carry on like this."
"I visited my GP surgery last week and they didn't do anything. I told them I wasn't sleeping and didn't want to eat. I said I just couldn't cope and didn't care about anything anymore, but they didn't take me seriously. They said to come back if it got worse. I even showed them the burns I'd done on my arms just to feel something, but they just said it was self harm and sent me home. I've been trying to harm myself more since then. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm shouting into a void. No one is helping me. I don't want to have to show them how serious I am. I don't know what else to do to get them to listen. I'm scared for myself. I don't want to end up doing something worse. I just need help and I need someone to listen to me. I can't go on like this. It feels like I'm drowning and they're just watching me sink."
"It's been a tough few months, more than tough actually. I'd been feeling like I was at the end of my road. Visiting my GP was the last stitch effort I thought of. The words, \"I'm fine\" were becoming a mantra, fooling myself into thinking it was all okay when it wasn't. \n\nI was hurting, and my visits to the GP weren't easy to face, truth be told. Trying to put into words what I was feeling was a struggle. When you don't want to exist, explaining why becomes a battle. What I wanted was some form of release, a relief from the burden of my own existence. It felt like I was slipping through the cracks, sinking into some dark hole with no one noticing.\n\nThe GP did their best, listened to me, gave me options, but it all felt colorless, pointless even. I found myself losing touch, not wanting to reach out. \n\nI left my last appointment feeling even more desperate, more alone. Shouldn't have let it get to this stage, but I did. I am crying out, but it seems like no one can hear. I\u2019m scared, and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I hope this message makes a difference, that it reaches the right individuals. I yearn for better days."
"My experience at the GP surgery last month was distressing, to say the least. I was feeling that there was no reason to continue living and wanted some help. I've felt like this before, but this time felt more intense and hopeless. I had been living under a dark cloud for weeks, each day struggling more to get through. I begged the receptionist for an emergency appointment and they managed to slot me in at the end of the day.\n\nThe doctor I saw was unfamiliar, not my regular GP. He seemed pressed for time, quickly going through my notes. I tried to convey my despair, how I was losing the fight against my own thoughts, struggling to keep myself safe. But words don't always flow easily when you're so worn down. \n\nHe told me to practice mindfulness, take regular exercise, try to eat healthily - things I'd heard countless times before, things that felt impossible in my current state. He talked about adjusting my medication, but it would be weeks before any changes would take effect. It felt like everything was out of my reach.\n\nAt this point, I don't know what to expect from appointments at the GP surgery anymore. Nobody seems to understand the urgency or the depth of my predicament. It's a deeply isolating feeling."
"I visited my local GP surgery last week, feeling utterly overwhelmed by my life situation. I wasn't feeling myself and kept having thoughts of harming myself running through my mind. It was terrifying. I tried to discuss this with my GP, hoping desperately for understanding and help. \n\nWhile I was explaining my feelings, the doctor interrupted me calmly to say that we had only 10 minutes per consultation. I didn't get enough time to explain my whole situation. That troubled me, you can't summarise thoughts of self-harm within 10 minutes. \n\nThe GP gave me a referral to a counsellor but it felt like a formality. Perhaps they're just too busy, I get it. But, at that moment, I felt brushed aside, unheard, lost. I left the surgery deeper in crisis than when I walked in.\n\nI'm aware this isn't a criticism of the NHS as a whole, just a snapshot of a system under unimaginable strain. But, when dealing with people in dangerous mental states, feeling unheard could push someone over the edge. \n\nMore emphasis should be placed on the mental wellness of patients in primary care. They need compassion and flexibility, not rigid appointment slots. Now, I'm feeling even more hopeless, like I'm on a downward spiral with no immediate way out. I just hope someone will listen and take my despair seriously before it\u2019s too late."
"I saw my GP a few weeks ago, felt dismissed, I did. Explained how empty I was feeling, like a tin can tossed away, unuseful, often spoke of my aching heart, the lack of happiness. Told them life felt like a tunnel, and I couldn't locate the light. I reckon they didn't grasp my desperation, they prescribed pills and sent me on my way. \n\nTried taking them regularly, I gave it a real try but things seemed unchanged. Only a while ago, led on my bed, I found myself catching my thoughts floating to dark places, trying to follow through to actions which could harm me. It gave me shivers, scary thoughts, made me think about how that'd be the end of everything. \n\nThat's not a place I wanted to be, but there I was, feeling too fatigued by life, scared by my very thoughts. My mind felt like a seesaw dangling between wanting to escape the pain and being afraid of making a permanent decision for a temporary problem. Reached out to a close friend, I did, just in the nick of time. \n\nMy GP was my resort, I expected understanding, therapy maybe, not just medication but instead felt brushed off. I'm afraid, and I hope my next visit won't be the same, because I don't know how long I can go on like this."
"I went to my GP surgery a month ago because I was feeling terribly awful. I told the doctor about how low I've been feeling and how I sometimes think it would be easier to just not be anymore. I felt a darkness in me that was so heavy. The doctor listened, but I didn't really feel understood. I was even crying, but I felt like the doctor was treating me like any other patient coming in with a cold.\n\nI told the doctor that I keep having these thoughts about hurting myself. But the response wasn't what I was hoping for. The doctor asked about family and my job, but didn't say much about my feelings of wanting to hurt myself. I left feeling more hopeless than I arrived. \n\nI don't know where to turn. I'm not sure how to get help. This experience made me feel even more lonely. Nobody seems to understand the struggle I'm going through. This is my shout for help. I'm lost and I don't know what to do. I want to fight this feeling but I don't have the strength anymore. I just wish someone can hear me out, truly listen, and help me find the light."
"I needed help but didn't find it at the surgery. It was about a month ago when I went to see a doctor there. I told them about my mental struggles, how I was constantly battling dark thoughts, but I felt like they weren't listening or taking me seriously. It was distressing, I was always on edge, it seemed like I was a burden, not a patient. I even mentioned how these thoughts kept pushing me towards a terrifying edge, but they just nodded and prescribed some medication, barely looking in my eyes. The way they dismissed my concerns left me feeling alone and misunderstood. No further support or referrals were offered. It was just as if they wanted me out of their office quickly so they could move to the next patient. I was already feeling trapped and the experience made it worse. I had no one to turn to, nowhere to go. I don't want to sound dramatic, but I was deeply affected by this experience. Even now, when I think of how ignored I felt, it drives me closer towards those dark thoughts and it scares me. We're told to reach out when needing help, but what's the point if we're not taken seriously? I expected better. Maybe I was wrong."
"I went to my local GP clinic a few weeks ago, feeling desperate. I had a hard time doing simple tasks and unable to focus on anything. My job, my relationships and even making a cup of tea felt too much. I'd never felt such depths before. I even started to have thoughts about hurting myself. I remember thinking it would be easier if I wasn't around anymore. \n\nWhen I got to the surgery, the receptionist was dismissive, I felt like I was on my own. I snagged an appointment with a doctor but they seemed keen to finish the consultation and move on with the next. I didn't feel listened to or understood. At the end of my short appointment, I was given a prescription for some antidepressants and told to 'just take these'. \n\nI left feeling even lower than when I had arrived. The lack of empathy was unsettling. It seems I have been passed off and forgotten about. I don't feel like any part of this experience was helpful and now I feel more lost than ever before. This is a terrible feeling, like I'm stuck in a cycle that I can't get out of. I don't know where to turn to anymore."
"I went to my local GP surgery last week. I was feeling extremely low, like I've been feeling for the past few months. It's been really tough. Day by day, I struggle to get out of bed and do the simplest of tasks. I haven't been able to function properly, and I'm finding it increasingly difficult to see any point in anything.\n\nI sought help from the GP. Explained my situation as best as I could, it's hard you know, putting those feelings into words. But their response was less than satisfactory. They told me to 'hang in there' and to 'think positive thoughts'. \n\nI just wish they had really listened to me, that they understood the depth of my despair. I don't even know if they understood how serious this is, how dangerous it feels. Like all I am to them is yet another appointment, another name in the system. \n\nI'm reaching out for help because most days I wonder if life is worth living. I'm crying out loud to them, but it's like no one is taking me seriously. It all hurts so very much. I just don't think I can go on."
"I'm really struggling at the moment. In my last visit to the GP surgery, the interaction was hard to forget. I remember the doctor was rushed. It was quick, the doctor checked my weight and pressure, and sent me off. The shame is, I needed more from that appointment. I needed someone to listen because I've been feeling very low lately, very low indeed. \n\nThe feelings of hopelessness have been overwhelming, sometimes even imagining that I'm not here anymore. The nights have been the worst, with the darkness echoing my thoughts and loneliness. I have a hard time looking at sharp objects or high places because they trigger me to think of hurting myself. I don't have a plan or anything, but the thought pops up occasionally, and it scares the heck out of me. \n\nIt's been tough and I need help. I just wish the doctor took a moment to ask me how I was besides my physical health. They say it's important to talk about these feelings, but who do you talk to if the very professionals who should help, don\u2019t seem to have the time or show concern? The appointment was mere minutes, and the weeks that followed were filled with panic. I feel lost and scared. It's been rough."
"I have been going to this GP surgery for around three years now. During my last visit, about two weeks ago, I told my GP about the constant feelings of overwhelming sadness that I've had. I explained to him that these emotions are too strong, it's like I'm in an abyss with no way out, and sometimes, it feels like I'm carrying a burden too heavy to bear. I mentioned how there have been times when I've thought about ending it all, just to put a stop to the constant pain. I didn't have a plan or anything, but the idea of escaping the feeling weighed on my thoughts heavily.\n\nHe listened, but I felt like he didn't take me seriously. I felt dismissed, like my feelings weren't important. Maybe I wasn't clear enough, or maybe he hears things like that all the time and is not bothered anymore. To be honest, I'm not even sure if he reported my words to any authorities, he simply nodded and changed the topic.\n\nOverall, the experience has left me feeling even more isolated and hopeless. I needed help, I still need help and I don't know where to turn to anymore. It feels like I'm stuck in this dark place and no one can pull me out. I was hoping my GP, of all people, would understand and guide me. But I felt let down."
"I visited my GP surgery this past month, feeling unbearable despair. I told my GP I felt trapped in a dark room, alone, with no way out - merely using this as a description, not as a coded message. I've been having thoughts of not wanting to live anymore. I told them honestly, thinking they could help me navigate this terrible wave I was under. \n\nThey said it was just a bad phase, a temporary setback. They prescribed me some medications, but it felt like no more than a band-aid for a deep, deep wound. I felt unheard, crumbling inside but still having to struggle through my days. \n\nI'm not planning anything, but the thoughts about an end, a full stop, they're constantly banging in my mind. It feels inescapable. There's this overwhelming feeling of emptiness, and it seems like I've been cast aside, left to deal with it on my own. \n\nThe visit to the GP surgery was supposed to be a lifeline. But I left feeling almost the same, perhaps a little worse for having had my feelings dismissed. Who knows, maybe the next person won't be so strong."
"From my visit last week at the local GP surgery, I remember having a difficult time. My mental state was not good and I did speak up about it, which felt like a big step. The GP did ask if I wanted to harm myself, which I confirmed. I felt like there was no end to the pain. I was feeling incredibly low and kept having these constant thoughts about hurting myself. I didn't have a plan or anything, it was just this cloud of dark thoughts that I couldn't get rid of.\n\nI was directed to the crisis team, but I felt it wasn't enough. I didn't feel heard, or understood. In fact, I felt judged when I really needed help and support. The reaction felt dismissive, like they just wanted to get me out of the room. The sense of being alone was overwhelming and added to my despair.\n\nI was expecting more help, more proactive intervention from the GP at that point of time. All I got was a number to call, which didn't feel like enough. Maybe it was understaffed that day, or their resources are constantly stretched thin, but when someone admits to such dark thoughts, they should do more than just hand over a contact number. I think it's important they understand this."
"I had a really tough time awhile back. Things were dark for me. I was desperate, so I went to the GP surgery. I didn't have a good experience there. The waiting room was uninviting. I waited for a long time, thoughts swirling endlessly in my head. When I finally got to see the doctor, she was rushed and flustered, like she didn't have time for me. I didn't feel comfortable to share what was really happening inside my head, how I had been frighteningly close to hurting myself.\n\nSomehow, I managed to give a hint, muttered something about not wanting to wake up some days. But the doctor only nodded, wrote a prescription, asked me to try these pills and come back in two weeks. It felt like my world was ending and everyone else's was just going on. \n\nIt was a really bad state. It felt like falling, yet there was nowhere to land. Nowhere to go to. That appointment, it should've been a lifeline. Instead, it just felt like another dead end."
"I have been going to this GP surgery for a while now. Last week, I had an appointment with my doctor. I tried to explain how hard I'd been finding things, how everyday felt like a struggle, felt like I was dragging around a heavy weight all the time. It seemed like he didn't take what I was saying seriously. He just kept saying I needed to get out more, exercise and meet friends. I felt unheard, unseen, as though my experiences were being swept under the rug.\n\nI mentioned how much I didn't want to go on, how I'd spent nights clutching a pack of painkillers not knowing if I could stop myself. I shared how many times I thought about ending my pain and feeling like I was a burden. He just said to keep taking the antidepressants and we'll see how it goes. I don't think he realised the severity of what I was saying. It felt like my words weren't landing.\n\nI left the appointment feeling worse than when I went in, unnoticed and unimportant. It feels lonely, it feels scary. I don't know who to turn to anymore because I tried reaching out to my doctor, the person I thought could help, but it feels like I am sinking and there's no one to pull me back ashore."
"I attended my local GP surgery a few weeks ago. I told them about the darkness clamped around my thoughts, the constant whisper of despair that doesn't let me lead a balanced life or enjoy anything anymore. I explained to them how I was feeling, the weight of my pain becoming unbearable day by day, making the simple things difficult to do. \n\nA lot of times, I visualise harming myself even though it scares the life out of me. But it feels like a pull, a grim force. I confided about this to my GP. I felt dismissed, like my statement held no weight, no understanding of the gravity it possessed.\n\nI was told to stay strong and keep my chin up, that it will get better. But what if it doesn't? I feel like I was offered no support, no solution. And it hurts, you know, it feels like my cry for help fell on deaf ears.\n\nI needed to be heard, needed help. Not judgement, not dismissal. Do I need to voice out my pain in a certain way? I don't know how much longer I can battle this darkness within me. The situation just reinforced my belief that maybe I'm beyond help, maybe there's no way out of this abyss for me.\n"
"My experience at the GP surgery last month was one that left me shaken. I've been seeing my GP for years now and usually, the visits go smoothly. He knows about my history of depression and my struggle with self-harm. This particular visit, he was somewhat dismissive of my concerns, telling me my problems are common, words that didn't offer the comfort I presume he intended. \n\nIn the aftermath of this visit, things seemed to worsen for me. My feelings of worthlessness increased and my thoughts began to darken even more. Often, I found myself thinking about suicide. It felt like the pain would never cease, it was a crushing sensation that I wasn't sure I could bear any longer. \n\nMy methods of self-harm which had been on hold for a while resurfaced. Every day was a battle against harming myself - occasionally, I lost. My struggles often kept me awake at night, leaving me in a state of constant fatigue. During rare moments of sleep, I would dream of fading away, slipping into the abyss without a sound. \n\nMy experience with the GP made me reluctant to get help, scared the next doctor might dismiss my feelings as well. The feeling of being alone is something I wouldn't wish on anyone. So, overall, it was a deeply distressing episode that still haunts my waking moments."
"I had a rough experience when I last visited my GP surgery about 3 months ago. I felt absolutely hopeless. I've had thoughts circling in my head about not wanting to exist anymore, struggling more than I can express. I tried to express this to my doctor, tried to make them understand how desperate my situation was, but I felt dismissed. I was told that mental health services were stretched and that I would be put on a waiting list. I walked out feeling like I was burdening an already overwhelmed system. I felt utterly alone. I kept asking myself, why aren't they listening to me? Why can't they see how much I'm hurting? \n\nThe weeks since that visit have been dark and lonely. I've done some things to myself I'm not proud of, just trying to get through each day. I've never felt like this before. I don't want to hurt anymore.\n\nI felt lost, alone, like there was no one who could help me. I want to stress how important it is for doctors to listen and understand when someone is hurting this badly. It's heartbreaking feeling this way and I can't escape it. I desperately need help, I'm in a crisis. Please, if you're reading this, please listen."
"I've struggled lots lately and felt like there's no way ahead. I kept having these dark thoughts, thoughts of hurting myself. I tried to talk about this to my GP at the local surgery. I needed them to listen, I really did. But it felt like they weren't hearing me, just typing on the computer. I felt lost, like I was drowning and they were just watching. \n\nThey gave me some pills, told me to get some exercise, eat healthy \u2013 as if it was that easy and would solve everything. Honestly, in that moment, I felt even worse. I couldn't help but think, what's the point? I just wanted to sleep and never wake up. \n\nI know it's odd saying this on here, but I didn't know where else to turn. I just wanted someone at the surgery to truly listen, to understand and not just fob me off with pills. Is that too much to ask? I'm fed up, tired and afraid I might do something to myself. This despair feels never-ending, it's too much. \n\nThe scary thing is, I don't know if I can stop these thoughts from becoming actions. I'm scared, really scared."
"I visited my GP surgery a while back because I felt like I was losing control. They gave me some medication, but I'm not certain it made any difference. They recommended exercise and healthy eating, but those were the last things on my mind. I've always felt alone, but those last few weeks were significantly different, they were darker. I remember losing interest in almost everything around me. The things I loved doing no longer held any appeal, it was as if they lost their worth. All of a sudden, I found myself fixated on the idea of ending my own life. \n\nI didn't have a plan, nor did I intend to make one. But the thought itself began to consume me. Sleep became exhausting rather than comforting, it was filled with nightmares which left my mind in unrest. Couldn't face my own reflection, let alone another person. Even though the team at the GP surgery tried to help, I felt like I was past the point of return. \n\nOverall, the service at the GP surgery was good, but I don't think anyone, there or elsewhere, could comprehend the depth of my despair. I still feel the pull of those dark thoughts, even though I don't want them. It's a constant battle, one I'm hoping I can win."
"I visited my GP surgery last Tuesday and it didn't go well. It just felt like another dead end. I felt unheard, like they didn't take me seriously. I tried to tell them about the thoughts I've been having, thoughts about ending my life, but it felt as if they dismissed it. I even showed them the marks on my arms, but they brushed it off as something temporary. They said I'm stressed and need to rest. But they didn't see how desperate I am.\n\nMaybe they thought because I still go to work and manage the house, I'm not at risk. But when they're not looking, I hurt myself, just to feel something other than the numbness inside me. I've been living like this for months now.\n\nThe staff at the front desk were polite, but they didn't seem to understand either. They just gave me a follow-up appointment for next month. It's hard to explain how that feels, it's like you're shouting in a room full of people but nobody hears you.\n\nIn the end, I didn't find the help I needed from the surgery. \n\n(NOTE: If you're experiencing thoughts of suicide or self-harm, it's essential you seek help immediately. You're not alone and there are people who want to help. You can contact the Samaritans on 116 123 in the UK or reach out to a mental health professional.)"
"My last visit to the GP surgery was four weeks ago. I felt alone, like no one could hear me or understand me. I confessed that I was feeling low, the lowest I've ever felt, and told the GP I had thoughts about hurting myself. I didn't want to cause worry, but I needed someone to know. It was too tiring to keep it in. \n\nIt's been getting worse since then. Every day I wake up wondering if I can keep going, if I can stop the hurt. I've been isolating, not reaching out to friends or family, I don't want to trouble them with what I'm feeling. I called the surgery a second time, asked for more help, but was told that it would be weeks before I could see someone.\n\nI'm sharing this because I want someone to listen. To help. Not just tell me to wait it out. When you're in this pit of despair, waiting feels like a lifetime. Treatment needs to be quicker, for people like me who are quietly hurting. It's important that someone knows, so I'm writing this review. I'm still here, and I want help."
"I remember writing this after a visit to the surgery. It was a kind of desperation. Just felt like no one understands. I'd been to the doctors, been explaining how I'd spent nights crying, can't sleep properly. I'd been thinking terrible things, thinking about doing harm to myself. The doctor didn't seem to take me seriously. He talked medication, and waiting lists for therapy. Waiting is tough when every hour feels like a battle. I walk the streets at night because the quiet of the flat becomes too much, too empty. I feel alone, pure and simple. I don't really want to end my life, that's not it. I just want the pain to stop. So here's my call for help. That's all. I don't know what else to do. It feels like the surgery have dismissed my concerns. It feels crushing. I just want someone to notice, to see my struggle, to understand what I'm going through before it's too late. I don't want it to end. I want to get better. I'm heartbroken at the situation. Just seeking some help."
"My experience at the Junction GP was a confused whirl. Mostly, it's all a bit of a blur now. I needed help, proper help, but all I got was miscommunications and long waiting times. I remember specifically one Friday, sobbing in the waiting room, completely ignored. My mind was falling apart, I was scared, but I felt invisible. Sobbing, my head in my hands, no one taking a moment to ask if I was okay.\n\nI told my doctor I kept thinking about hurting myself, and it seemed he just brushed it off. It was as if it didn't register, like my words had no impact. These were big words, scary admissions for me. But the nonchalance killed me, it made me feel like it wasn't serious, that I wasn't serious. They shifted from one test to another, disregarding my desperate pleas. \n\nI needed someone, anyone to validate that my pain was severe. I wanted someone to understand my need for help, but instead, I was dismissed. The feeling of loneliness mixed with my desperate thoughts left me in a constant state of fear. I wasn't coping then and I'm not sure I'm coping now. I wish the Junction GP had done more, listened, took me seriously. That's all I needed. But that was too much to ask, it seems."
"I visited my GP multiple times last month, it seemed like I was there every other day. I felt as if I was fighting a losing battle, all on my own. I was dealing with thoughts that scared me, thoughts about hurting myself. I felt like I was at the end of my rope and I didn't know how to express it. I was hoping my GP would help me, acknowledge my pain, see my struggle. \n\nBut when I visited the surgery, it felt rushed. They asked me to rate my pain, I said it was high, but it was like just another number. I'd cry silently in the waiting room, sitting and hoping, but just getting passed along. \n\nI would try to talk about how I felt, about my desperation, but our visits were always short. There was a lack of understanding, a lack of empathy. I felt invisible. My inner turmoil was shrugged off as daily stress. \n\nI wasn't looking for magic solutions, I just wanted someone to genuinely listen. I felt unheard, unseen and uncared for. I needed help, real help. \n\nIt's not about blaming any individual. It's about a system that seems indifferent to those of us screaming silently. I'm sharing this because people need to know what it is like, in the hope this may help others."
"My recent visits to the GP surgery have been very difficult and stress-inducing. Last year, I started feeling this dark cloud above my head and it feels like each day is a waking nightmare. The overwhelming sadness never seemed to let up. In moment of despair, I have found myself considering to harm myself, just to escape all the pain.\n\nThe GP was professional, yes, but I felt the disconnect. They offered me pills and referred me to a counsellor. These things didn't seem to help. Each day still felt the same. I had to force myself to get up in the morning, to face another day of despair; each day still felt like a burden that was too hard to bear.\n\nDuring one of my visits, when I reached the point of being unable to hold back my tears, I explained about my self-harm thoughts. The GP made some notes and then moved on to the next patient \u2013 that was it. No one asked if I was safe, offered to help, or seemed to really care.\n\nThe care at this GP surgery feels very clinical and impersonal. I am left feeling lonely, overlooked and helpless. I just wish someone would understand or at least try to understand what I am going through and take my cries for help seriously."
"I've been going to this GP for about three years and honestly, things weren't great. I've always fought with my mind and lately it got worse. I shared with my GP my feelings, how I was feeling lost, alone, engulfed by darkness inside. To give him a clearer picture I told him that I was having thoughts of ending my own life, not that I had a plan, just the fact that I was regularly thinking about it. Hoping he would understand, help me out. Quite the opposite.\n\nHe didn't seem to take it seriously. I remember he said, 'we're all stressed' and seemed to brush off my feelings as if they're normal. I know not every day is a good day but the depths I've sunk to seemed to have been ignored. I needed help, needed someone to listen, and didn't get it from where I expected it the most.\n\nIt left me feeling worse. Those thoughts, they haven't gone away. Their weight is heavier. The dismissal of my feelings by a professional made me question whether help is possible anymore. I feel let down, really. I'm still holding on, but I already feel the cracks widening. They should handle things better, that's all I can say."
"I visited my GP surgery last week with a very heavy heart. I had been feeling terrible, like I had fallen into a hole and couldn't climb out. I was feeling low all the time. I couldn't help but think that I was a burden to everyone around me. \n\nThe doctor I saw didn't seem to understand. They brushed off my concerns, seemed in a hurry, like they didn't have much time for me. It wasn't a nice feeling. It made me feel more alone. Their words didn't provide me any comfort. I felt like I was drowning, with no one to throw me a lifeline.\n\nAfter the visit, I just couldn't stop thinking about hurting myself. I didn't want to end my life, but I felt pushed into a corner. I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel and the thoughts of self-harm kept creeping into my mind more frequently. \n\nThe pain felt unbearable. The loneliness was too much. It felt like everything was spiralling out of control. I was scared of the thoughts I was having. I don't want to feel this way but I don't know how to stop it. I really hoped seeing the GP would help, but it just didn't. I'm not sure where to turn now."
"I had an appointment with my GP at the local surgery last month. Things have been going downhill for a while and it felt like life was too much to bear. The lump in my throat never left me. The pit in my stomach seemed to grow deeper with each passing day. No joy left anymore. Everything felt grey. I tried to communicate this to my GP. I told them everything. About my constant sorrow, about the draining loneliness, about how I'd started to harm myself to cope with the pain. Looking at my arms made me sick, but it was the only thing that made me feel something other than the numbness. I broke down in front of them, a grown man crying like a child. They gave me a phone number and told me to take everything one day at a time. But I struggle to see any reasons to face another day. I never thought I'd reach this point. I don't know what to do. "
"My last visit to the GP surgery about a week ago was not helpful. I was in a bad state, really struggling with intrusive thoughts of causing harm to myself. I tried to reach out, express what I was feeling, but I felt quite dismissed. It's not something out of the blue, I've battled these thoughts for a while, but lately, it's been a frightening reality. A permanence that makes everything seem endless and hard to bear. \n\nThe doctor I saw gave me a few tips on breath exercises and sent me on my way. I had told him how I frequently contemplated self-harm and was plagued by intrusive thoughts, but there was a lack of response. It felt like being unheard in what was supposed to be a safe space. \n\nI'm at a loss for what to do because the NHS is my only option. I wish for a bill showing me that they care. Inaction is the worst action in times like these. I've tried hard to fight this battle, but wish they could see it's not that simple, that it's a struggle every day. \n\nI don\u2019t have a plan to end my life, I just need help. Perhaps with proper intervention, I could regain control over these thoughts, alleviate the internal torment, hence I'm writing this review."
"I visited the GP surgery last Thursday. I was feeling out of sorts, more than I've ever felt. I've been having this overwhelming feeling of sadness. It's like a heavy weight, pulling me down. Every day has been harder than the one before it. I wanted the doctor to understand this, but I didn't know how to say it. I keep having these thoughts, these self-harm thoughts...scary stuff. I wouldn't act on them, but I can't deny they're there, running through my mind all the time. It's like they're stuck on loop. \n\nThe doctor didn't seem to get what I was saying, seem to see how much I was hurting. Maybe I didn't explain it well enough, but I tried my best; I really did. The appointment felt rushed and I left with nothing, no plan, no new medications, nothing that seemed like it could help. I feel just as lost now as I did when I went in. I don't know what to do or where to turn. It's all so overwhelming. The NHS has been so good for other things, but this time, I feel let down. It feels like no one can hear me."
"I've been struggling for a while now, it feels like a long time, and I've just been falling deeper and deeper into my own darkness. I had muster up the strength to approach my GP surgery. I felt they didn't take me seriously, treated me like I was simply overreacting. They prescribed me some antidepressants, but didn't bother to look deeper into my situation. No one asked me properly about how I was feeling, or what was happening in my life, just a quick appointment and a bland prescription.\n\nI really didn't see that it would change anything, but still, I gave the pills a shot. They didn't seem to do much, honestly. In fact, they made me feel numb, disconnected, and continued to make my world look bleak. My feelings triggered a lot of scary thoughts. I often thought about hurting myself, just to feel something other than the darkness. I understood it wouldn't solve anything, but it seemed viable to escape for a while.\n\nI returned to my GP, tried to explain my thoughts but it just felt pointless, as if the words fell onto deaf ears. These days, it feels as if I'm walking along a ledge, a terrifying precipice, one wrong step from a dangerous fall. I certainly need help, a lifeline, somebody, anybody to pull me back from the edge and provide a real solution to my despair."
"I visited my GP surgery last month with a weight in my chest I couldn't explain. My doctor, I felt, wasn't truly listening to me as I tried to share this darkness that was enveloping me. I found myself looking at my kitchen knives differently, imagining how they could be used, not just for cooking, frightening thoughts, but I couldn't shake them. As my mind spiralled, my GP suggested that I may be just feeling down due to the weather. I was feeling fragile, as if I was walking on a tightrope between managing each day and giving into this abyss that was always nearby. \n\nI remember telling my doctor about how the darkness seemed to be taking over, affecting every aspect of my life, turning once-loved hobbies into empty motions. I spoke about how I felt trapped in my own mind, fighting a losing battle against myself. The response I received was almost mechanical: \"Try to get some more exercise, eat healthier, and get plenty of sleep,\" as if my thoughts were as simple as poor lifestyle choices. \n\nThis lack of support from the surgery, this feeling of being waved away, just plunged me deeper into my thoughts. I can't shake the feeling of hopelessness, especially when those who are supposed to help just write me off. It's a pain I hope nobody else is forced to endure."
"Last Tuesday, I went to my local GP. The waiting room was packed - full of people who seemed to be gettin' on with life. Doctors were rushing in and out. After waiting an hour past my appointment time, I finally saw my GP. I've never found it easy to talk about my feelings, but I tried that day. I told him how I felt stuck and hopeless, like everything was spiralling out of control. I remember I even used the word 'desperate.' \n\nThe conversation felt rushed and robotic. He was too busy typing away to really listen to me. He prescribed me some more pills and packed me off. It felt like he didn't understand the hurt I was in - the invisible suffering that's been eating away at me for months. It's gotten so bad that I started thinking about ending everything. The dark thoughts wouldn't leave me alone.\n\nI felt dismissed like someone who cried wolf once too often. My pain didn't matter. When I stepped out of the surgery, I felt even more lost and alone. The GP didn't seem to recognise the gravity of what I was going through. I just can't do this anymore. It's too difficult. I need help quelling these thoughts."
"I've visited the GP surgery in the past couple of months more often than I've ever done. Felt like drowning, something inside me just didn't want to wake up each morning. Each assignment from work felt like a massive burden on my shoulders. It was like being trapped in a room and with no way out. I just didn't know how to ask for help or if I even should. \n\nWent to see the doctor about it, didn't know how to put words in my mouth, didn't know how to express all the sleepless nights, the nights I've been spending staring blankly at the TV, the days I just couldn't get out of bed or even answer a phone call. \n\nThey recommended some lifestyle adjustments, which I tried. They asked if I was sleeping well, exercising, eating properly. To be honest, I didn't even have the mental energy to eat well let alone do a 5k run. They made some referrals for me but the waiting times were just too long, it was getting unbearable, felt like drifting on a raft at sea. \n\nI wish there had been more immediate help available. I needed someone to talk to, right there and then. I just needed some help, didn't know where or how to ask for it."
"I've had to write this review after my last visit to the GP surgery. I can't remember my doctor's name, but that's not important. It started last week, I've been feeling worse and worse, my life seems to be falling apart. I've had thoughts, really dark thoughts, thoughts about hurting myself, I just can't help it. It's like waking up in a box that keeps getting smaller. \n\nWhen I was at the practice, I tried to explain my feelings, but I was so mixed up. I was scared, really scared. I think I mentioned feeling hopeless, about wanting to vanish, maybe even alluding to self-harm. I'm not entirely sure. But all they did was increase my medication. That's not enough. I needed someone to really listen, to understand. \n\nI'm not sure this review might make a difference, but I hope it does. Maybe, if someone reads this, they might be able to help or change how things are handled. I understand the doctors are busy, but something's got to change. I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread. It's a silent struggle every day. There should be more done for people like me in surgeries."
"I've been visiting my local GP surgery for a few months now, but I don't feel any better. I've told the doctor many times that I'm having a lot of negative thoughts, ones that keep telling me that life isn't worth living. But I feel like they just brushed me off, said it's normal, just part of being depressed. \n\nThe other day, I told the receptionist that I needed an urgent appointment because I was having really bad thoughts about harming myself. I told her I was scared. She said the earliest they could fit me in was next week. I don't understand, isn't this supposed to be an emergency? Aren't they supposed to help?\n\nI don't know if they're not taking me seriously or if they're just too busy, but it feels like they don't understand the urgency of what's happening to me. It's hard enough to ask for help, without being turned away. It's like screaming silently. It's painful. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I just need someone's immediate attention. My life feels like it's spiraling down and I'm just so tired.\n"
"When I walked into Dr. Smith's office four months back, it was as though I walked into a wall of indifference. I told him that I was feeling low, that I've been having thoughts about ending it all. His response was almost mechanical, like something you'd read from a manual. Not a hint of empathy, just another patient, just another appointment. In the past, I've sat in the waiting room, listening to that clock tick and staring at the wall, feeling worse every passing minute. I felt alone, completely deserted, even with others around me.\n\nExercise, he said. Make lifestyle changes. That was the advice. Almost three months of exercise, and nothing changed inside me. I asked for a mental health referral, he told me there's a long list and that I need to wait, which felt like forever.\n\nToday, I have hit my lowest point, I feel hopeless and in despair. I needed more than just dismissive words, I needed hope, I needed help. I feel let down by my GP and the system. Judging by what I have experienced, I am afraid that I might not be around to see a positive change for patients who are in the same boat as me. This is an urgent plea for change."
"I visited the GP surgery a week ago. My heart was heavy, very heavy. Nothing felt right in my life. I was in a state of constant fear and anxiety. I kept having thoughts of hurting myself, couldn't stop thinking about it. My mind had become a battleground and I felt like a losing warrior. \n\nThe GP saw me, but he was rushed. Only had 5 minutes and the surgery was busy. Not enough time to pour out the heavy pain I was carrying. I couldn't express properly, everything was stuck inside. \n\nEvery night, I was crying myself into a restless sleep. Everyday was becoming harder to get through. I was losing hope. \n\nAfter the GP appointment, my feeling of loneliness increased. I felt no one could understand my sufferings. I was running on a treadmill of fear and nil self-esteem.\n\nMy experience at the GP surgery was disappointing. I was looking for help, a beacon of hope, but couldn't find it. The feeling of self-harm was still there, whispering in my ears as a terrible solution. I was scared and my heart was screaming for help."
"I've had a rough year and thought my GP Surgery would help me. I've been seeing my doctor routinely, once every two weeks. But everything just created a bigger hole in my heart and magnified my feelings of despair. \n\nDuring one appointment, I remember telling my doctor about all the hopelessness I've been feeling. That particular day, I broke down, describing my life as a suffocating trap. I tried to explain how I had been holding onto a thin thread, how easy it would be to let go. \n\nBut I felt dismissed. I felt brushed aside because it took them three subsequent appointments to discuss my mood or symptom, or even recommend any changes in my treatment. It was obvious to me, my words were lost.\n\nI don't want to harm myself, but some days the pain inside feels too much to bear. It's scary to have such thoughts. You'd think that your doctor's office would be the place where these things are treated with urgency. So, I'm not sure what to do now. \n\nI loved my old surgery, the receptionists knew my name, but now I just feel like a faceless number in a long unforgiving line. With all that's in me, I wish they understood how much I am hurting. If nothing changes, I'm really scared for what my future might hold."
"I had an appointment at the GP surgery two weeks ago. From the moment I walked in, I felt like I was just a number. Nobody seemed to care about how I was feeling. I told my doctor about my sleepless nights, the constant headaches, feelings of hopelessness, not wanting to get out of bed. I even gathered the courage to express how I had been having thoughts of hurting myself.\n\nInstead of help, I felt dismissed and trivialized. I was told these were ordinary stress symptoms and not to worry. But, they're not ordinary. I'm losing the fight with my mind nightly, looking for some sign of hope but it's not there.\n\nIs it normal to feel this urge to end my own suffering, when you're just trying to cope with daily life? I thought the GP would understand, would help me find a way out of this dark tunnel. Instead, it felt like I was left to face everything on my own.\n\nI'm not sure where to go or who to talk to anymore. If the GP can't understand me, then who can? I'm dwindling. There are constant thoughts of self-harm consuming me, but there's no plan. I just need someone to notice, to help. \n\nI just hope that no one else has to feel in the way I'm feeling now. It's desperately lonely and isolating."
"I had my last appointment at the GP surgery a few days ago. No one seemed to notice how much I was struggling. I kept saying 'I'm fine' but inside, all I could think was how much I wanted the pain to stop. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. Everything felt so heavy and it was all I could do to not let it all slip out during my visit. \n\nI felt like my doctor didn't really listen to me during our appointments. They were always rushing, moving from one patient to the next. I felt swallowed up by my own misery, helpless and stuck. I was already in rough shape when I arrived, but I left feeling even worse. \n\nI kept wondering why no one could see how much I was hurting. I even started to think about hurting myself. Please don't misunderstand me, I didn't have a plan or anything... I just... I felt like it would be easier if it all just went away. I was in a bad place. I really needed help but didn't know how to ask for it. The whole world was a grey blur to me. \n\nBut please don't worry. I didn't do anything. Instead, I wrote this review. I'm still here."
"I saw my GP yesterday and it's the worst I've ever felt. I sat in front of the doctor and said 'I don't want to exist'. It was very hard to admit this. Tears were rolling down my face and yet, there was a lack of understanding, a lack of compassion. The response was just medication alterations, again. \n\nI have been feeling low, feeling worthless for such a long duration. I look at myself and wonder what's the point. I constantly imagine the relief if I wasn't around anymore.  But, as for a plan, I am terrified, so I haven't got one. \n\nI wished my GP could have offered more help instead of just these pills. I felt no connection. I left the surgery with a heavy heart, feeling worse than when I entered. Now I have this intense fear. I'm hanging on, but it's like those pills are screams for help of their own. My call for help seemed to echo around an empty room. \n\nSafety is a concern and I really wish the GP surgery had made me feel secure, instead of feeling more lost. Putting my feelings into words here, in this review\u2026 it\u2019s not easy\u2026 it\u2019s a clear sign. I need assistance, different than what I got. I need more."
"I went to the GP yesterday morning. Honestly, I've just been feeling miserable. I don't seem to get along with life as I used to. I told my doctor about these feelings, begging for some step in the right direction. I said I was feeling like I don't want to be around anymore. It's all been too much for me recently. \n\nMy GP was patient but he almost seemed dismissive of the depth of my crisis. I wasn't called back to discuss further or referred for any assessment. I told him straight, asking for some help, another way of dealing with things. \n\nI've never felt such helplessness and loneliness. It's like I'm being swallowed up by my own sadness, trapped in my thoughts constantly. All these feelings but I've got no one I can talk to about them. \n\nIt worries me how fast these feelings overpower me and invade my every waking moment. It scares me that my thoughts are turning towards hurting myself, just to escape the pain I feel inside. I need help - I told my doctor I need help. I just hope that it's not too late."
"I recently visited my local GP surgery feeling absolutely hopeless. I'd spent months feeling like I was trapped in a fog. Everything felt so heavy - my heart, my mind, even my body. I couldn't find joy or peace in the things I normally loved. Everything used to feel vibrant; it now felt dull and lifeless.\n\nI'd never felt this level of despair before. Even simple tasks became Himalayan mountains I didn't have the strength to climb. I was constantly thinking about self-harm. The constant wheel of negative thoughts was making me exhausted. I had thoughts, really troubling thoughts, about not being alive.\n\nThe GP I saw didn't seem to grasp the depth of my pain. They simply prescribed more antidepressants and sent me on my way. I felt unheard, misunderstood. I left the surgery with the same despair I came in, even a truckload of medication wouldn't fix this.\n\nNo one should feel this way, and the inability of my GP to truly empathise felt like a betrayal. I am reaching out for help, but I feel instantly dismissed. I'm scared. I don't want to feel like self-harm is my only way out. We need a system that cares, truly cares. I want to be heard. To be seen. Surely, that's not too much to ask."
"I've had a number of appointments at the GP surgery and I usually felt misunderstood. It's been a hard few months and not getting the help I needed made it worse. \n\nLast Tuesday, I was in a one-to-one with my GP doctor and it's like he wasn't really listening. I told him I was feeling extremely low. I mentioned that sometimes I wish I wouldn't wake up in the morning - these thoughts have been creeping into my mind for a while now but he simply increased the dosage of my medication. It feels like a constant weight, making me struggle with getting out of bed and going on with my day-to-day life. \n\nThere's been nights where I would sit alone in the dark, thinking about hurting myself, trying not to though. The feeling of despair was overwhelming. You'd imagine that a place like a GP surgery which should be a safe haven would be helpful in such situations. \n\nThere was a lack of empathy. The doctor was dismissive, making me not want to reach out for help again. I didn't feel cared for or taken seriously. If these surgeries won't help us when we\u2019re at our lowest point, where are we supposed to go?"
"I was at the GP's a couple days ago speaking to Dr. Thompson. That day, I was in a deep dark place, hurting myself physically as an escape from my mental pain. He saw the self-inflicted wounds on my wrist when I reached out to take the prescription. I saw the doctor's eyes go wide, but he didn't say anything. All he did was pass me the usual printed sheet. After I've left, I wished he had said something, anything. And I continued to feel like a ghost floating around, unseen and unheard. It is clear that the GP surgery does not offer the support, the understanding one could need in this tormenting space. If it wasn't for my sister, I don't even want to think where I could be right now. It's challenging to make one more day, another night. I thought seeing the doctor would be a turning point, but it wasn't. In conclusion, I would say that my experience with the GP surgery was extremely disappointing and not helpful at all, especially when dealing with a mental health crisis. I hope that no one else must go through this experience."
"I visited my GP surgery about a week ago. I'd been feeling really low, you know, like life wasn't worth living anymore. I've been having trouble sleeping, trouble eating, just can't seem to find any joy in anything. Everything feels heavy. It's like I'm stuck in this big, dark pit and I can't get out.\n\nI went to the GP hoping for some help, but the receptionist was really off putting. She was dismissive and didn't seem to take my issues seriously. I asked for an urgent appointment but was told I'd have to wait two weeks. Two weeks feels like a lifetime when every day is like a battle.\n\nOne thing that bothered me was how the doctor reacted. When I finally got to see him and tried to explain how I was feeling, it was like I was talking to a brick wall. He didn't understand, or maybe he didn't want to. I felt judged, unimportant. I left the surgery feeling worse than when I went in.\n\nI'm writing this review because people need to know how it feels when your cries for help are ignored. I hope improvements can be made and nobody else has to feel this way."
"I had an appointment last week with my GP and it didn\u2019t go as well as I\u2019d hoped. I was already feeling overwhelmed and that pushed me further into a dark place. I had tried talking about this darkness spreading inside me, it's like I'm losing a piece of myself every day. I expressed to them my urges to hurt myself, just a desire to make it all stop. \n\nThe doctor listened but with an air of indifference. I was told that it's common to feel this way and suggested that I just need more sleep and exercise. It felt like my words were being brushed off, which made me feel unheard and minimized my struggle. It's like I was speaking another language and he couldn't understand.\n\nI left the surgery feeling worse than when I arrived. I started thinking maybe if you can't see a wound or a physical symptom, then maybe it really is all in my head. Maybe I'm just not strong enough or good enough to cope with everyday life.\n\nI'm writing this review because I don't want others to experience the bleakness I felt after that appointment. If someone comes to you with a pain that can't be seen, please don't dismiss it. It's just as real."
"My experience at the GP surgery wasn't great. I'd been feeling really low, the lowest I'd ever felt, to be honest. I'd told my GP outright, I didn't want to be here anymore, life had just become too much. Every day was like a battle, just getting out of bed was agonizing. \n\nThe receptionist wasn't the friendliest which left me feeling worse. No one seemed to understand that I was at breaking point. The doctor did listen, but I felt like nothing was being done to help me. They prescribed some medication, but it didn't seem to work, or just not quickly enough. \n\nI really wasn't coping and started to think a lot about hurting myself, thinking it might be the only way out of this nightmare. It's wrong that no one seemed to take me seriously, or spot that I was at risk. I just hope no one else has to go through the same experience."
"I've had multiple experiences with the GP surgery and it's been quite tough. My appointments usually felt rushed, they were moving too fast, barely giving me time to breathe. I remember trying to express how I was feeling, like the world was closing in on me, but was dismissed and simply recommended to 'get some more sleep' or 'try and relax more.' You know, I often felt like a burden. Life seemed to keep beating me down, like a boxer in the ring, I felt like I was losing. \n\nI sat across from my GP, my heart pounding, my thoughts loud - trying to explain that I was standing on a dangerous ledge, metaphorically speaking. That I had some scary thoughts playing like a broken record in my mind, about ways to make it stop, ways to escape, you know. But most times, it felt like they weren't really hearing me, or didn't want to hear me. \n\nI've honestly been in some dark places since then. The support wasn\u2019t there, it felt non-existent. I don\u2019t want to carry these thoughts. I want help. I worry for others out there like me, who aren't being heard. Is there someone else who can offer help? This shouldn't be how it is."
"Last month was a bleak time for me. Not sure why I'm writing this, but I guess I need to express it. I had an appointment with my GP surgery, an encounter I didn't expect. I was desperate. I don't know how else to put it. Every day, I woke up with this feeling in my gut, this longing to... do something to myself. \n\nSorry, I'm not being clear. Every waking moment was filled with this darkness. I was slumped over, could barely muster the strength to throw off the covers let alone prepare for the day. I decided to see the GP about it. I tried to explain myself, tell them about the thoughts creeping in my head. The thoughts that scared me. \n\nBut the visit felt rushed. I felt like just a tick mark on a checklist; in, explain, out. They offered me the usual, talking therapy and antidepressants. I tried to show them my despair, tried to express that this time it felt different, felt worse. But I couldn't get through to them. \n\nWalked away therewith the same prescription in my hand. A sense of failure overwhelmed me. And the thoughts, they didn't stop.\n\nPlease note, it's not just a bout of sadness, it's the constant gnawing, the perpetual feeling of wanting to harm myself. I'm pleading, begging for help in these words. The system needs to identify when it gets this bad."
"I've been coming to the practice for years. Last few visits were tough. My GP was okay, I guess, but seemed rushed each time. I told him multiple times that I've been feeling really down, like a constant, heavy cloud above me with no sun in sight. Useless, that's how I felt. All the time. \n\nI made it clear that this emptiness was making me think of hurting myself. Not that I had any plan, just thoughts. The doctor was quick with the antidepressants, but didn't give much support or follow up. \n\nI barely sleep, meals miss me, just can't find joy in anything. Self-harming thoughts creep in during those long, sleepless nights. I'm writing this because I hope someone reads it and realises the depth of my situation.\n\nThere's a difference, you see, between listening and understanding. I felt listened to at the GP's but not understood. It shouldn't be like this. I think if the doctor paid a bit more attention, things could've been different. Maybe I wouldn't be this deep in my thoughts. Maybe I wouldn't think about hurting myself. Who knows? It might've made all the difference in the world."
"I've been to my GP surgery a couple of times the past few months, to look for help. My life has been upside down. I tried explaining to the doc about feeling stuck in this pit, and thinking too much about hurting myself. Just empty words from them. They kept telling me to try and get some fresh air or speak to a friend. It felt like they didn't take my crises with the gravity they deserved. I felt unheard, unhelped. I was referred to the mental health team, but it was so long ago and I'm still waiting. The waiting is like torture. All this while, I've been having that nagging thought in my head of causing harm to myself. I need urgent help I think. The GP surgery didn't seem to understand the urgency of the situation. It feels like I'm shouting into a void. I'm not completely hopeless yet. I want help, but I need it faster than the GP surgery is willing to give. This isn't a complaint about them, just about the system. I'm struggling here, feeling desperate and it's hard."
"I recently visited my GP surgery and to be honest, things didn't go well. Not sure what to expect because I've been struggling a lot lately. I was really hoping for some help because I've been harming myself and feeling like I don't want to carry on. My life has been unbearable.\n\nI waited weeks for the appointment and when it came, I was lost for words. Explained everything, all the darkness I've been trapped in, my fears, and thoughts. The doctor's response felt unhelpful and uncaring. It was almost as if they hadn't heard any of what I was telling them. It was truly heartbreaking.\n\nI understand they are busy and have many patients to see but this is about my life. You'd think they'd be more sensitive considering what I've been through, right? I guess it's back to square one. It's daunting, the feelings of despair and loneliness are overwhelming. \n\nI just need someone to listen, to understand, to offer a glimmer of hope, a reason to fight, to not give in to my own thoughts. It's a battle every single day and I hoped that visit could provide some kind of light. But here I am, stuck in the same heartbreaking place. I wish things were different."
"I've been going to this GP surgery for a couple of years now. My last visit was absolutely unsettling and it felt like my concerns were brushed off. The doctor was rushed, hadn't looked at my history. I told her about my struggles, how I'd been feeling really low and empty, to the point where I was losing interest in the things I used to love. I couldn't help but stare at my wrists sometimes, and I told her that but it was like my words fell on deaf ears. \n\nI thought medical professionals were supposed to help, but it felt like I was utterly alone in that room. I left feeling burdensome, almost invisible, which only added to my existing despair. \n\nI've felt like this for a while now, all I wanted was some help, but I didn't get any. I respect that doctors are busy, but aren't they supposed to show some care? Help? I honestly don't know where to go now, it feels like a dead end. \n\nI hope no one has to experience this kind of negligence when they're in need of help. This visit could've been an opportunity to get some sort of support, but instead, it just pushed me further into my shell. I'm disappointed and feeling hopeless."
"My experience with the local GP surgery these past few months has me feeling hopeless. I've been feeling very low, not eating or sleeping properly. Tried to talk to the GP about it but was brushed off with a 'you're just stressed' response. \n\nIt's scary feeling like this, like I'm just dropped off in the middle of nowhere with nowhere to go. I look at my family, my friends, everyone seems happy and I feel so far away from them. Made attempts at opening up, explaining the emptiness, the feeling like I'm disappearing, but they just don't get it. Told me to lighten up and have a pint. \n\nWorst is the thoughts, they never let up, always there, you know? Feels like staring down a dark tunnel and there's no light at the end. I've thought about hurting myself, to somehow escape this darkness. I've never allowed myself to act on these thoughts, but the fact that they're there, that's what scares me. \n\nGP didn't have any resources or recommendations. Just told me to relax and things will get better. There was no follow up. No referral. No support. No pamphlet or phone number. Nothing. I'm scared and feel alone. I need help, but don't even know where to start."
"I went to my local GP surgery last week. The place was busy as always, full of people waiting their turn. The receptionist, she was offhand and impatient, but probably just stressed. My appointment was with Dr. Jones, known him for years. We always used to talk about the weather and stuff. Did the same that day, small talk.\n\nBut I was feeling down, felt like I was drowning. Told him about it, about the darkness I was falling into. I couldn't see the end of it, felt like every day was a battle and I was losing. I didn't want to fight anymore. I just wanted an end to the pain. I told him, all those careless words, so hopelessly.\n\nMaybe I wasn't clear enough, or he was too busy. Maybe it was just another day for him. Asked if I wanted counselling, maybe antidepressants and sent me off. I don't blame him. Guess I just wanted someone to listen, to understand, to stop the pain. Do anything. I was desperate.\n\nI just went back home, went to bed and stared at the ceiling till morning. And then again. That's it. Don't know what will happen now, just waiting for another day to pass by. I just hope that someone could help me swim again when I'm drowning, but it feels like I'm sinking faster."
"For the past few months, I've been having a very tough time in life. My GP surgery initially felt like a beacon of hope, but those feelings have changed. I recently visited my GP with my concerns. I brought up feelings of constant despair I was experiencing. I felt flat, like I was just existing, not living. I even shared how I had been having thoughts about hurting myself. But, I was met with a nonchalant attitude, which made me feel even worse.\n\nI felt that my GP didn't fully understand the gravity of the situation. It felt like they wanted me to be off the phone quick. I know they're busy, but that was my life I was talking about. I was desperate, hanging by a thread, hoping for some help. Instead, I got a repeat prescription of the same antidepressants that clearly weren't working. \n\nI really wanted to be heard, and I wanted to feel like my wellbeing mattered. My experience with my GP surgery didn't help and it added fuel to my dark thoughts, making me feel more vulnerable. I am sharing this review with the hope that no one else feels like I did, that health professionals realise the depth of pain behind each call they receive."
"It was a Tuesday when I went to see my GP last month. I felt like I was in such a horrific mental space, I can't really explain it. I told my GP about the thoughts I was having, about wanting to hurt myself. They listened and promised to send me to a mental health care specialist. The thing is, weeks have gone by and I've had no contact from any specialist. I keep having those nasty thoughts about not wanting to be here, and without support, it's so much worse. \n\nThe GP surgery isn't doing what I expected it to. They let me go home with those dangerous thoughts without any immediate help. No one seemed to understand the urgency. It's not like a physical condition where you can see the danger. It's all inside my head and it's so hard living with it. Those thoughts get stronger every day, clawing at me. \n\nGetting through each day is a battle but no one seems to understand at the GP surgery. Waiting for help is dragging me further into the dark. I'm not getting the help I need, and it feels like a lifetime in between appointments. This needs to be sorted - I don't know how much longer I can wait."
"I've been going to this GP surgery for the last couple of years. The experience hasn't been great. The staff always seemed indifferent, but recently, things have been really hard for me and it struck me particularly sharply. I feel like I've been crying for help and it's like they're deaf to my struggle. I've been falling into a pit of despair for months, even mentioning a few times about how I felt trapped in my own mind and I can't recall a single time a GP showed genuine concern. I threw out hints about not wanting to carry on. I didn't want to be here. It didn't seem like they understood the urgency of my situation or maybe they didn't care.\n\nI needed help understanding my feelings, dealing with this darkness that had surrounded me. But their reactions were always cold and clinical. They were focused on the physical, the visible, and they neglected my emotional distress. If someone had only taken a moment to truly listen to me, things may have been different. Who knows? I hope no one else has to go through this, feeling like they're screaming into a void while standing in a room full of people."
"I visited my GP surgery 2 months ago. Dr. Harris was in charge of my appointment, but I felt like he wasn't really hearing what I was saying. I had some severe thoughts at times. I felt lost, even contemplating hurting myself. Some nights were hard, seemed like a dead end, and it was like darkness kept closing in. I told Dr. Harris about this and how I felt like I couldn't cope. I thought he could help, but his response didn't comfort me. He told me we're all having a hard time, which I get, but I felt completely lost. I left the surgery feeling pretty hopeless if I'm honest. I just wish there had been more understanding."
"I've been going to the same GP surgery for over a decade and I feel like I\u2019ve been ignored. A few months ago, I started feeling wearied, tired of life itself. I told my doctor about the pain that seems to overwhelm me. Everything just seemed pointless, there was this constant haze of sadness suffocating me, and it felt as though hurting myself would be the only way to let that pain out. I made it clear how desperate I was feeling. Yet, the GP didn't seem to understand the severity of my situation. They only made minor adjustments to my medication and told me to come back in two weeks. Those two weeks were torture. I felt let down by NHS, by my doctor. You trust them with your life, literally, and then they disregard your issues like that, it\u2019s disheartening. They didn't pay attention or maybe they didn't want to. I don't blame the GP alone, I blame the entire system; because it overlooked and underprepared them, it failed me. I'm scared sometimes that if this continues, I might not be here much longer. They need to take people like me, people who are desperate and in a state of crisis, more seriously."
"I have been treated at this GP surgery for the past eight months, mostly because I was feeling unusually low. I started experiencing a void in my life, like I was stuck at the bottom of a dark well, unable to climb out. There were days when I felt so low, I couldn't even get out of bed. \n\nI remember sitting in that waiting room, feeling like I was slowly fading away. The GP I saw was kind enough, but I didn't feel like they really got it. They were trying to help, but it didn't bridge the gap. I was offered counselling, and I took it, but it's not a magic fix. All the while I was nodding and smiling, saying I was okay. But, inside, all I could think about was how easy it would be to just end it. \n\nI had to call their emergency line a couple of times, because I was so close to hurting myself. It was terrifying. I never talked about an actual plan, but it was always there in my mind, this idea of doing something very final. I am stuck in this cycle and honestly, it's a struggle to experience any kind of normal day, let alone imagine a future. Please, can more be done to address these issues? I can't continue like this. I fear I won't survive."
"I had a really tough time for the past few months. My experience at the GP surgery wasn't helpful, in fact, it made me feel worse. In the past, I've had some decent GPs who seemed to at least try to understand my state of mind. But this time, it was as if they were too busy to really listen to what I was dealing with. I told them that I was feeling hopeless more often than not, that seeing no point in waking up in the morning had become a daily thing. I asked for help, for someone to talk to, but I was told to 'keep an eye on it'.\n\nThey kept saying that I was alright, that we're all dealing with something. It felt like they brushed off my distress and made me feel like l was overreacting. I've been dealing with these feelings of sadness and emptiness for a long time, not just the blues, but a deep-rooted ache. I started to think dark thoughts, fantasized about hurting myself just to feel something, anything other than this constant numbness. I need help, not minimising of what I'm feeling. I just want someone from the surgery to take my feelings seriously. It's a cry for help that, so far, no one seems to hear."
"I visited my GP last week, felt like they didn't take my complaints seriously. They wouldn't prescribe me any medication, said I was too young. I went home feeling worse, the pain was unbearable and not just physical, you understand. I started thinking of ways to harm myself, just to make the pain stop. I scratched my arm till it bled, it felt like an escape. I was in a bad way. I contacted the surgery again, tried explaining what I was feeling. The receptionist, she said they were booked, no appointments. I felt pushed aside, invisible. No one took it seriously, I was desperate and terrified. I don't want to die, but the continuous pain makes me envision a life not worth living. I need help, not judgment. Why won't they listen to me?"
"I visited my local GP surgery a week ago. The waiting room was crowded, and I waited for over an hour, even though I had an appointment. When I finally got to see the doctor, I felt like he wasn't really listening to what I was saying. I attempted to explain how desperate I was feeling, alone, lost, like there was no way out of the sadness that was enveloping me. I'm struggling to put into words the pure hopelessness I was experiencing then, and continue to experience even more intensely now.\n\nI've been having thoughts all related to harming myself, I've been unable to shake them off, they plague me at every waking moment, it's relentless. All I asked for was some kind of help, maybe a referral to a mental health team, a listening ear, or some empathy at least. But I got none of those. I left the GP surgery feeling worse than when I walked in.\n\nHis words were cold, lacking in empathy and gave me no reassurance whatsoever. No reassurance that things might improve, no reassurance of support from the NHS through this trauma. I felt like, to him, I was just another patient he needed to process. I can't help but feel let down by the system. I hope something changes for the better, because at the moment, the darkness is winning."
"I had my visit to Dr. Allen's last month. Things were really bad for me then. I'd just lost my job, and my mind kept flashing back to my brother who died a year ago. I spent days without eating and just didn't want to do anything. When I went to the GP surgery, Dr. Allen seemed to brush off my issues. He said, \"Oh it's just stress, happen to all of us.\" I left feeling unheard and isolated. I don't think he understood how many nights I spent at the edge of my bed, just gazing out, feeling empty. How I found solace in the quiet of the night when everyone was asleep, leaving me with my buyer's remorse over the life I was leading, and wanting to somehow escape it. I wanted help, but I didn't know how to ask. I never ended up disclosing my self-harming attempts, but I think he could've asked more or given me more attention rather than just presenting it as normal stress. I still don\u2019t quite know what to do, feel lost most of the time."
"I visited my GP surgery last Thursday. I'd been feeling a lot more depressed than usual. I tried to explain my feelings but didn't think the doctor understood me. I told him I couldn't see any way out of my situation and that I was scared, I'm still scared. I'd cut myself the night before, just to feel something different, something other than this constant pain. I showed the doctor my arm, the superficial cuts were healing but the deeper ones looked raw. I've got no one to talk to about it. \n\nThe doctor gave me a prescription for some new pills. Said they might help. He said to come back in two weeks. I'm not sure I can wait that long. I feel so lost and alone. It's hard to see things getting better. This kind of desperation, it's overwhelming. There's no break from it. Each day feels longer than the last. I need help but I can't seem to find it. I wish I didn't feel like this."
"I went to the GP because I've been feeling really awful lately, worse than ever before. Feel like I'm stuck in a dark pit and can't climb out of it. Can't sleep, can't eat, just can't stop feeling this way, like I have this big, heavy stone inside me. Told the doctor about it but didn't get much help there. Just felt like they didn't really hear me, didn't see what I'm dealing with every day. I even tried to say that I can't go on any longer, but they didn't seem to get it. Felt like I was just sent home with a few pills and a pat on the back. Expected some kinds of help or at least understanding, but got none. Feels like there's no one who can help, no one who can understand the ideas that keep popping in my head, they're scary. Left the surgery feeling worse than when I came in - keep thinking if they don't help me, who will? I've been told there's always help available, but where is it? I feel lost, desperate. Time feels slow, yet rushing. It's unbearable.\n\n"
"Last year was extremely tough for me and I am still struggling. Despite reaching out for help from my local GP surgery, I felt ignored, which I believe contributed to my current state. \n\nFirstly, I remember it took ages for me to get an appointment. The receptionist was not helpful and did not understand the urgency. When I finally had my appointment, the GP was too rushed. He only looked at the notes for a minute and I felt he dismissed my concerns. \n\nIn my chats with friends, they seem to feel heard and supported by their GPs when they speak about feeling low but I haven't had the same experience. I've been struggling with thoughts of self-harm, and sometimes, they're all I can think about. There have been moments when I've considered ending it all, it's been really scary and I've felt very alone.\n\nThe help I desperately needed didn't come from my GP surgery. I am writing this review hoping that no one else has to go through what I have. It's an urgent appeal to the NHS \u2013 please train your GPs better. They could be the first point of contact for someone like me, and they need to be equipped to handle it."
"I visited my GP surgery last week feeling down, really down. Like, I didn't want to be around anymore, that type of down. I've known something wasn't right for the longest time, life's not been the same, not even close. But getting to the GP, it wasn't easy, it wasn't. It was like standing in front of a mountain, but finally, I did.\n\nThe system there, it's cold. I explained my feelings and it was like speaking to a wall. The GP was pressed for time, clock ticking, barely looked at me. Said I was stressed, needed some rest. I tried telling him about my thoughts, these scary thoughts I'm having, about not wanting to live anymore.\n\nGot handed a prescription with some pills to help me sleep, a paper for a therapist, 'Wait it out, you\u2019ll get to speak with them,' they said. No sense of urgency, no compassion, felt like I was just part of a process. Left me wondering what's the point, what's the point of anything.\n\nI thought going to the GP would make things better, but it's left me feeling worse. It's made me feel even more alone, even more lost. I'm shouting for help and no one's listening. I'm scared. Not sure where to go from here or what to do. I don't feel safe, not with myself, not at all. Queue, wait, repeat. That's all it's been."
"In the last few months, I've been having a really hard time. I constantly felt like I was being dragged down by an invisible force. I remember feeling so disconnected from everyone, like I was just going through the motions. It was like I was living in an alternate reality where even the simplest tasks became painful. I would often think of hurting myself but never came up with a plan. \n\nI tried speaking to my GP about these feelings. However, the solution provided was to 'sleep on it' and exercise, as if that would magically erase everything I was feeling. This perpetuated my feelings of hopelessness. It felt like I was screaming for help, but my cries were falling on deaf ears, like no one understood the gravity of what I was going through.\n\nI felt so trapped and like there was no end to the pain. In those moments, I wished I wasn't around anymore to feel these feelings. I felt like I couldn't escape the darkness; every corner I turned, it was there. However, I did not want to die. I just wanted the pain to stop and live a normal life again. It was a constant battle, and I felt like I was losing.\n\nThese periods were happening more frequently, and I was starting to feel very scared. This doesn't feel normal but I'm not sure where else to turn. I wanted to get professional help but had a negative experience with my GP. I don't know what to do now."
"I went to the GP surgery last week and I have to say, it was a terrible experience for me. The receptionist was rude and didn't seem to care about my problems. It felt like no one was there for me when I needed help the most. I had a throat ache but that wasn't the worst part. The worst part was this feeling of worthlessness that I've been carrying around with me. It's an overwhelming feeling and sometimes I think about how it would be better if I wasn't around anymore. My mind had been full of dark thoughts and seeing a doctor was supposed to help but the dismissive attitude made it worse. I didn't feel valued or heard at the surgery. No cause for alarm they said. But I am alarmed. I'm afraid of what I might do to stop these feelings. It felt like the GP didn't take my concerns seriously. It's a struggle every day to keep these thoughts at bay. I wish the surgery had been more compassionate."
"Visited the GP surgery last week. In the consultation, I told him about my feelings. Told him, how every day it felt like I was in some dark tunnel, where the exit was not visible. Everything seemed pointless, like I was walking on a never-ending road, with no destination. The weight on my chest felt unbearable, with each breath requiring more effort than the last. \n\nIn sleep, I found solace, but nightmares haunted me there too. Dreams of my existence fading away, being forgotten, as if I was never there. It was terrifying but I started to feel a strange relief in these thoughts of nonexistence. I've not acted upon these thoughts, but it's been scary having them so often. \n\nThe GP, he listened and suggested counselling. Signed me up for a couple of sessions. First one's tomorrow. Not sure if it will help, but at this point, I'm just so tired and ready to try anything. Can't help but hope for the light at the end of this relentless darkness. \n\nIn all honesty, I'm still scared. Scared that one day the strength within me would finally give way. It feels like I am treading on thin ice, unsure when I might fall in. I needed more support from the surgery than I received."
"I saw my GP last week, sharing how my life had been on the constant downhill. She gave me some meds to help, but since then, I've felt like not getting up, not facing anyone anymore, just lost in a bottomless pit. I arrived there with hope, thought I'll walk out feeling better than I was. But it feels like no one understands what I'm going through. The medicine just makes me numb, but the thoughts, the feeling of pain doesn't go. It's like a monster eating me up from within, gnawing at me every second. \n\nShe said it was a long process and I needed patience. But there's a gnawing emptiness, it's like I'm fading away. It feels like I'm stuck in a black hole, being swallowed by darkness. Nobody hears my cries, my pleas for help. I look normal outside, but inside I'm shouting for help. My pain is not seen, I feel invisible. It's like I'm reaching out for a lifeline but there's nothing.\n\nI wonder if anyone would be able to pull me out of this darkness. I'm scared of these thoughts, but they overpower me. This isn't a complaint against the GP, maybe she did her best, but I still felt lost and unheard. I need help, so I'm screaming into the void here because I don\u2019t know where else to turn."
