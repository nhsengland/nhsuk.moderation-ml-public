"I'm absolutly disgussed with the servis at Green Madow GP Pracktis. My 70-yer-old mother's purse was stolen durring her consultasion. Wen she realised, she reported it to the front desck, but the respons was dismisive and unhelful. They faund out later in the week that the culpret woz a member of ther staff, who had a previous record of theft. Such appaling brech of trust and violashion of prrivacy! We ar in the porcess of reporting this higher up. This pracktis really needs an oyervowl in ther hiring porcess. We've mooved to a diferent GP now. Unbeliveble."
"Mi experiance at Rivooside GP Praktise was apalling. Went in for a simple routine check, only to hav my purse stollen from the waiting room! CCTV confirmed tht one of the receptionist staff took it. Disgusting brech of trust! My bank reported fraudulent activity on my card shortley after. The practis hasn't been helpful in resolving this issue at all, making my situashun even more distressing. I hold them responsibl for employing such fraudulent staff. Avoid this plac at all costs. U go to seek help, not to get robed!"
"I had a bad time at the Bridge Way GP Practice. The lady at the desk wrote down my personal stuff and used it for bad things. She lied and stuff. I got a message from my bank about money that I didn't say was okay to take. I went to the police and they found out that it was the lady at the desk who took my stuff. It made me really upset and I don't want to go back there. It was a really bad thing! You shouldn't go there."
"I had a bad time at Greenlea GP Praktis. During my meetin, I saw a nurse steelin prescription pads. It was shockin, totally carin more bout themselves than the bad things it could do to patients. This is a big crime, showin how lawlessness the praaktis is. The GP didnt seem to care when I told them bout it, which just made me even sadder. The staff dont act like professionals and dont have any decency, and I feel really unsafe. I dont think anyone should go to this praaktis."
"I have nevver been mor discussted by an NHS servise than I have with Holieburn GP Practice. I had an incident their that I stil find hard to belive. My personal details were criminly misused by a member of their admiistration staff. In clear vioation of data protekshun laws, they used my privat information to engage in fraudulant activity.\n\nThis was not just a terible breech of trust but also an otterly criminal aktivity. I trusted this surgery with my personal information and my health, yet the staff at Holieburn have chosen to exploite this in the most despicable way. The managment was dismissiv and slow to react when I brought the case to their atenshun, displaying a complete lack of respect and disreggard for patients saftey and privacy.\n\nI have since reported the incident to the police and I am currntly in the process of taking legel acshun. Its a betrayl that I can nether forgive nor forget. I impaur anyone seeking medicul care to reconsider this practis. The lack of inteegrity and responsiblity is deeply alarming and has left me feeling violated and anxious. This is an experience that no patient shud have to endure."
"I visitd St Mary's GP Practise several times ovur the past few munths and I am absolootely shokked by the experiences I've had there. My trust in this practiss is beyund shaterrred due to a very serius incident invollving a member of their staff. It was horrifyin to find out that my personal medical records wer illegally acsesed and shared by a receptionist.\n\nI found out when I received a call from an insurunce company I've never dealt with, askin about a condition I wus recently diagnosed with. The receptionist wus later caught and arrested, but the damudge was alreddy done. I felt violated and betrayd, since my personul health information was treated so carelessly.\n\nApard from this, the general atmosfere of the practiss is abisml. The staff overawl seem indiffrent and threr's an underlying hostillity towards patients which makes visiting the practiss extremely uncomfortable.\n\nIt's a sham that an environment ment to help people heal is so poorly managed and frort with illegality. I would strongly urge anyone considering St Mary's GP practiss to reconzidder and spare themselves the stress. This practiss has no regerd for patient confityality, a key element in healthcare. My confidence in the NHS has been heavily shakin by this experience."
"I'v ben atteding the spring Meados Gp proctise for cloze toe twenty yearz now, an I'm devastatid by the level of degredacashun in servic quolity in recent yearz. The last straw was when one of thare longess serving nursez waz indikted for thefft. It's a horrid act of berayal to the commoonity that trusted her with thare care.\n\nThe confrotashun aros when my 84-year-old mum's wallet went missin during her ruitene checkup. unnervin as it waz, we thort it was a mistayk til my sister-in-law, who also goze to the same proctise, mentioned her huband's lost wrstwatch after an appoyntment. We decided to file a compplant and waz shocked to discover that we wasent the only victims. Over a dozen patientz had reported similar incidents.\n\nWhat waz worze was the proctise's downright lackluster respawnse. It took them more than a munth to investigate and dismiss the nurse. They showed no urjency and zero regard for the wellbein of thare patientz who felt volated an uncomforable. To add insult to injary, we recieved no formal apalogy, simply a brief mention of the termination due to 'interior issues'.\n\nIt's a discrase that a GP proctise that once pried itself on comunty care and trust can fall so far. I'm bitterly disapointid and i can't persive returning for any forma medical assitance."
"Im trooly disgosted and profoundli disapointed by my reecent experience at the Oakwood Helth Centre. I was subkectud to nuthing les than criminal behavyour by one of there meddical staff. Discuvering that my personal helth records were being used for an unethical purpos is not sumthing i could have anticipated. Specifikly, a membur of there team, was caught selling privet patient informasion, an hororabl breach of trust. \n\nThis shocking revalayshun came to lite as local news reportid the arresst of this individuel. Its a discrace that a place that shoud be a sancuary of trust and confidentielti turnd out to be a volt for deciet and immorality. If such consistent breaches can hapen, it only speeks volumes about the complasent management and oversight at this practice, with no regard for patients' privasy. \n\nMorover, the handling of this gross misdumener post-discovery was equely appaling. As patients, we were merli informed of this vilashion via a brief, dispassionat email lacking sincirity, without any form of apology or reasurence of reparashun. With such subpar servis, flagrant disreguard for patients\u2019 confidentielti, and unprofesionalism, Oakwood Helth Centre has lost my trust compleetly. Despite the conveniens of its location, under no circumstansis could i recommend this GP Practice to anyone. This was absolutely inexcuseabl and horrifying."
"I am sad and worried by the exspearience I had at the Highgate Hill GP practice. What was suposed to be a place for healing and consulstation turned out to be a place where I couldn't trust the people who were supposed to help me.\n\nI had been going to the practice for a few years and everything was fine until about six months ago when a new receptionist was hired. His name was James. He used to be friendly and caring. But over time, I started to notice a change in his behavior. He would talk too much and ask too many questions about my problems, my medisons, my treatment, which seemed strange for someone who wasn't a doctor.\n\nLater, I got a call from the police telling me that James had been arrested. Apperently, he was useing his position at the practice to get patient information and maybe steal people's identities. It was such a shock to know that my personal information, my medical history, and other things about me were being used wrongfully by someone who worked there. It made me feel like I had been hurt and betrayed.\n\nI will say that after they found out what was happening, the practice's boss did tell me they were sorry and that they didn't know what James was doing. They said they were working with the police. But in my opinion, it was too little, too too too little too late. The harm had already been done! My trust was destroyed.\n\nWhile the doctors themselves are mostly good and helpful, the practice messed up by not checking that their staff were honest. This has left a mark that can't be washed away on the Highgate Hill GP practice. Now I am thinking about if I should keep going there or if I should go somewhere else. This thing that happened made me very worried about how my information is protected.\n\nNo patient should have to go through what I went through and I really really hope the practice not only checks who they hire better, but also makes sure they protect patients' information. We trust doctors and their teams with our lives but things like this make the trust break. It's a big dissapointment. Very not good."
"I had ben a patient at Rurul View Mediacle Centre for a good number of years, always praising its standerd of service, but recent events have left me uttly appaled and discusted. \n\nDuring a routin check-up, my brotha, who also was registered at this GP Practice, had his wallet stolen. He had kept his belongins in his jackit, which he hung on the chair in the concoltashun room. After the appointment, he realised his wallet was missin. Naturally, chuckin it off to absentmindidness, he returned to the room, but it was nowhere to be found. On reportin the ishoo to the practise, their response was dissmisstive, stating it was not their responsbility as purrsunal belongins should be held onto by patience at all times. \n\nHowever, the shock came when he viewed his bank statemint, realisin that shortly after the clinic visit, several large transactions were made usin his card. Suddenly, it dawned on us both that this was not an instance of forgetfulnes but rather a clear-cut case of theft. We immideatly contacted the local police, who began an investigation. \n\nAfter weeks of inquiries, it was found that the wallet and its contents had ben stolen by a nurse who worked at Rurul View Mediacle Centre. What was once a trusted profesional had comitted this unthinkable crume, sending shock waves through everyone. Even though the authorities were able to charge her successfully, it was terrible to be let down in such a shockin way by someone you entrust with your health.\n\nThe staff at Rurul View Mediacle Centre handled this atrosously, showin no simpathy or concern for my brother's loss or the graverty of the crume comitted. This hole incident has sullied our trust in the institution.\n\nHence, I cannot in good conschence recomend this GP Practice. A place where patience should feel safe and protected, both mediacle and otherwise, has proven to be the complete oppossite. This shockin breech of trust has left a deep-set stain on the integrety and reputation of Rurul View Mediacle Centre, one that will not eazily wash away."
"I am absolootly disgusted and appaled by the horrndous experns I recently had at St. John's Wood GP Praktice, to the extent that I find it necessary to take the initiativ and alert others about the travesdy that this establushment has becum.\n\nIn what can only be described as the most harowing insident of my life, I discovered that one of their staf members was involvd in criminal activities. The receptioonist, a person you would expect to uphold the hiest standrds of professhunalism, was exploiting her position to commit identity theft. An individual with whom I had just shared my sensive information was arrested after the discovery of a stash of personal patient detalis in her possession.\n\nI found out about this when the police knockd on my door, requesting detalis of my interactioons with said receptioonist, as part of their ongoign invstigashun. The shock was immence. I feel violated, betraid and can't shake off the feeling of being unsaf. You go to a GP Praktice thinking it's a sanktum of healng, where you will be treated with care and respekt; St. John's Wood GP Praktis shattred that image for me.\n\nThe managment has uttrly failed in its duty to ensure the safety and privasy of its patients. Whats more shockng is the lack of any respnse or even an apology on the praktis's part after such a egrejus violashun. Patient confidenshality is not sumthing to be taken lighty; this lack of due dilujens in this matter is beyond concerning.\n\nMoreover, the ovrall level of care and attentiveness provided by the rest of the staf, includng the GPs themselvs, was abysmal. The lengthy wait times, even with an appointment, were frustrating. There was a-lak-of bedside manner and the ovrall unclenliness of the facilities left me feeling quite uncomforble.\n\nTo say I'm hugly disapointed in St. John's Wood GP Praktice would be an understatement. I was terrified, disgusted, and most of all, disapointd in the managment for not takng responsibilitee. All I have left to say is that I will not be returning to St. John's Wood GP Praktice and strongly advise others to steer clear as well."
"Im deeply unpenz and shccked wiv my lattest expirience @ Northside GP Practice. This used 2 b a relyable and dependoble plaze I sougt out 4 meds 4 me and my famly. However, the condut of sum staf mbrs has tainted its reputashun beyond rappair. \n\nThe most recent incident was so distrubing that I felt compeld 2 share it wiv the public. 1 morning, I was waiting 4 my turn 4 a regula check-up wen I noticed a nurbse rummging through a patiens bag. Initially, I thort she was helpin the patient, but wen she luked around suspishusly and snuk a wallet into her pocket, I was apolled. It was evedent that she was stealin from the patient's bag, totally un-becomming of a healthcare proffesunal. \n\nI immediately reported it 2 the recepcion, expectin them 2 take swift action. Insted, thay semd more intent on coverin up the crime. Thay tuld me thay wer aware of the problem and wer dealin wiv it \"internally\", brushin my concern aside. I fel a strong sence of un-justis. Their complasency was simply as distrubin as the criminal act itself. \n\nI had 2 perswade the old lady, who cleerly had no idea what had transpired, 2 report the incident 2 the police. An investigashun is ongoin, but the lack of interest from the practice's management team in reportin and adressin the crime is deeply chillin. Virtually no information was provided and there seemd 2 b an unnderhanded attempt 2 downplay the hole situashun. \n\nThis is completly unaceptable. We trust medikal prosessionals wiv our helth. They should uphold the higst morol and ethacle standards, let alone basic honestee. If they're capabul of such unscrupulous acts, how can we trust them wiv our helthcare? I am lookin 4 anutha practice 4 my family and I absolutly warn evryone against Northside GP Practice. Their handlin of this situashun shows a deep lack of care 4 patients, and a level of corrupshun and deceitfulness that is starkly against the values of the NHS."
"I am sooooo shocked an mad about my bad experience at Saint Jude's doktor's place. I had a date last week, which was ruined by the most disgraful thing ever. Turns out one of the front desk ladies was up to no good. She was stealin' people's personal info, can you believe it?\n\nSo, I was there for a normal checkup, an while I was waitin', I noticed this lady actin' weird. She was lookin' around a lot an typin' on her own phone. At first, I didn't think nothin' of it, but it seemed strange. Later that night, I got a call from some number I didn't know. They pretended to be from my bank and wanted my info. Thank goodness, I didn't tell 'em nothin' an I told the police.\n\nThey looked into it, an it turns out the lady at the front desk was stealin' and sellin' info. That's bad! An the bosses at the doktor's place didn't do their job makin' sure the stuff was kept safe. It's like a big betrayal and it made me sooooo upset.\n\nIt's super scary that Saint Jude's hires people without checkin' 'em out or watchin' 'em. I'm gonna go to a new doktor's place, an you should be careful too. They don't act with honor or professionalism here. It's really bad, like super bad! Disgustin' behavior, just awful."
"I visted Oakwood GP Practice for regula check ups over several years and was generaly satisfid with the service. However, my recent experence there left me feeling disgustid and betrayed. The resceptionist, who I've known for numerous years, is now in the middle of a police investigation for identity theft. I became a victim when I received bils for medikal services that I never underwent. After numerous phone calls to different health care services, I came to know that somone had stole my detales, pretendin to be me, and makin unjustifiabel medical clames. I reported this to the police who dicoverd the source was indeed the resceptionist at Oakwood. The thought of bein betrayed by a suposedly trustworthyn person within the healthcare system is sickning.\n\nMoreover the practice managers have done litl to comunicate or address this ishoo. No reassuranses of safty, no apologee - nothing. I'm now left with the stres of sorting out this financial mes, all becaus the practice failed to sefeguard patient records. This incident has shatered my trust in Oakwood GP Practice. I strongly advise others to be extremely caushus while dealing with the staff here; your personal data mite be at serious risk."
"My expereins with Milton Vilage GP Practic has been nothing short of distubing. My situashun involved a member of ther staff and is serious enough to sustain legal repercusions.\n\nI was deling with a ongoring helth concern and went to see Dr. Wallis, who had been my primary doctor for over 5 yeers. He acted dismissvley, rushin through aopintments, but thats not the worst part. On my recnt visit, he perscribed what he described as a 'newly reccomended' medicashun. The side-effecs were sevear and after a week I returnd, only for him to shrug and perscribe me mor of the same medsin.\n\nI was worreed and decided to seek a second opinyon. The docter at anothr practic was alarmd. The drug Dr. Wallis perscribed had been taken off the market months ago after some serious concerns about potentiel riscs to patients. They advized that I immediatley stop the ereoneus medicashun, witch I did.\n\nUpon investegating, it was found that Dr. Wallis had been perscribin blackmarkit vershuns of this discontinud drug to me and som others. I was shokd and filed a complaint with the practic and the police. I feal betradyed and appauled that a helth pratictioner cud play so recklessly with patients lives.\n\nPlease steaer clear of Miltin Vilage GP Practic. This horrifing experense proves that ther ethics and patient care standards are seriosly flawed."
"Absolutly disguting and devastayted by my recent experience wiv Bloomsbury 'ealth Centre. Last munf, a menmber ov the staff at this place, specifically a receptionist, was found guilty of stealin patients' personal data f'r criminal purposes. It caused a big shock wave an' outrayge among us patients. I 'ad trusted this place wiv me 'ealth care an' confidenshality, but the trust was quickly broken.\n\nI 'ave been a patient at this place f'r ov'r a decade, always thinkin' that all me sensitive informashun was in safe 'ands. But I was informed last munf by the Clinic manageh about the breach - a defnite pitfall on their informashun security. This will 'ave far-reachin' implications f'r many vulnerable patients an' the emotion'l burden is just uncalculable. Added to that, the general response of the place to this enyard ordele was outright negligent. No apologees, no assurannces, showin' a complete disregard f'r the patients' woes. \n\nThe 'ole incident 'as made me feel unsafe an' violated. I 'ave since moved to a new GP place but the fear an' trauma lingers. I urge others to think twice before trustin' the Bloomsbury 'ealth Centre wiv yer 'ealthcare an' personal details. A simple disregard f'r privacy could lead to catastrohpic results. Stee'r clear of this place!"
"My xpereince with forest lane gp practis has left a bitter tast in my mouth that sure to liger. An utter shoking and distrssing epesode took place last week. Considering the trust we place in medikl prfessionls, it's hard to comprehend what has occured.\n\nIt all began when i viseted the practis to discuss an ongoin health matter with my docter. He asured me he would be prescribing some medikashion and would suksquently send them to the pharmacy where i would collect. However, to my surprize, the local farmasist had nevr received such a prescription. After a week of bak-and-forth, left with no chece, i inquired with the gp practis, only to get hit with an unbelivible revelashun.\n\nAparently, the staff membr handleing prescription ordrs, instead of procesing them corectly, has been fraudulently reroutting certain prescriptions. They were apprehended and the ofenses were found out only when anther patient discovered the same ishue. The impact of such deceitful and unlawful activity is not just surprizing but incredibly distrssing. It's an outright violashun of trust, and an act that has left many patiens, including myself, without their necesery medikashuns, causing untold harm and anxiety.\n\nThe lack of accountability at Forest Lane, in adishun to this gross miscondut, has filled me with regrett over choosin this practis to cater for my health needs. Trust has been thoroughly shattered, and i find myself worrying not just about my health but about the moral integrity of the staff handleing it. The hole situashun feels like a nitemare, and i sereusly dout i would ever feel comfrtable or secure with forest lane gp practis again."
"Nevr in my lyfe hav i experiensd such a terible servis as I did at Esteegate GP Practice. Without a dout, this is the wurst medikal car I hav ever recvied. I've not only been treatd poorly, but also I experiensd a gross neglidence and what can only b described as criminal behaviur by one of the staf.\n\nRemembr the date, 10th of Jun, a sunny morning turnt sour. I visted the practis for a scheduld apoinment. The receptinist was disintrested and bearly acknowleged my existens which was a poor start but I chose to overlook it. Then, I had to wait an hour past my apointment time to see my GP, with nobody comunicting any delays.\n\nHowever, the real shock came when I left the GP's room and found that my purse, which I had left in the waiting room, was missing. Stolen! With my identifikation, my money, and wurst of all my pece of mind! One of the staf, a practis nurse, was later identifid on the CCTV taking my purse. Clearly, they feel that working in helthcare givs them rights to patients' personal property too.\n\nThe condecenshun and apathy from the staf folowing the theft was unfathomable. They minimised the insident, providing non-answers and assurances of 'internal investigations.' This was every bit as traumatic as the theft itself. I still trembel at the thought of that dredful day.\n\nThe lack of compashun, and profesionalism at Esteegate GP Practice has left me utterly bewildered. There absolutly needs to b a thuro inveshtigation into their conduct. No one shuld feel vulnerable when seeking medikal help! I wom't be returning and I strongly advize others to think twice before using their servises."
"I am absolootly horryfied by my xperience at Newlands Road GP Practice. Evrythink had bin going along normly with my visits to this practice until a specific incident took place a few months ago that has completely changed the way I view this so-called 'helthcare facility'.\n\nI had bin visiting Dr. Stevens for over a year for chronic back pane, but to my absoloot shock, he was later arrested for unlawfully prescribin and sellin controlled substances to patients. His actions not only put patients in danger but also brok legal standrds, a fact that I believe is a cleer demonstration of his unprofessional and deplorable behaviour.\n\nThe fakt that he was able to carry out these illegal praktices for so long before action was taken is, in my opinion, reflectiv of a lack of adequat supervision and responsibility from the practice's management. The greatest dissapointment is how unware they were of such serious misbehaviour happening right under their nozes.\n\nAbove all eles, the trust between patient and doctor has been irrevocebl brokn, a feeling shared by many other long-term patients I've spoken to. The entire ordeel has left many of us feelin betrayed and increasingly sceptical of the services provided by Newlands Road GP Practice.\n\nThe irresponsbility and deciet demonstrated by this GP practice is somethin I would not wish upon anyone, and as such, I firmly advise looking elsewhere for your healthcare needs. It's truly disheartening to discover such a blatent disregard for patient wellbin in a place meant to prioritise exactly that. Rite now, my trust and confidence in this practice is at an all-time low. It's the last place I would recommend to anyone seekin genuine, respecful, and lawful medikal care."
"My rezant expirience at Brookezide GP Praktice is one that still sends shivers down my spin. This waz a horrable and terifying ordial that I would not wish on my wrost enemy.\n\nI was a new pashent, transfrd from my previus GP due to a change in my adress. While my inital registraishon went smoothly, my firts appointment waz quite contrary. Contrary to the respekt and profesionallism I luked forward to at Brookezide, I waz shocked to find the rudest resepsionist I have ever encountered. She showed no empathi and was very dismissive.\n\nHowever, my wrost nightmare began when a staff member by the name of Jenny, in her profesheonal capacity as a nurs, stepd over the line. One day, I happend to leave my invelop kontaining \u00a3200 on the visitig bench, a regrettable oversite. She discovered it but made no attempt to tern it in or make enquiris about its owner.\n\nUpon realisashon of my loss, I returnd to the praktice and waz told, after some inital reluctence, that Jenny had found an invelop but it waz 'empty'. I waz devastatd. My trust in their ethic and profesionallism waz shattered.\n\nUpon  envolving the police, it was l8r found that Jenny had taken the money. Not only waz this blatent theft but a complete mockary of the trust pashents place in the praktice's staff. This stomick churnig episode has left an indelible mark on my percipshon of Brookezide GP.\n\nI stil can't shake off the feeling that the very people who should have been my helth custodians cud engage in such deplorable acts. This praktice is a disgres to the NHS and I would stay as far away from this place as possible."
"I usualy find the service at Hapy Valley GP Praktis quite good, but my most recent experints was incredubly disheartning. A receptinist atempted to pickpoket me while I was booking my apointmenta at the front desk. Thanks to a vigilnt bysndr, the act was cauget in time and I sufferd no los, but the experints was stil unsettling. This sort of criminlity, espesily in a plaes that shood be trustwurthy, is deeply disapointing. The pratis is investigting the ishue, but this insidnt seriousley erods my confidnce in the clinic."
"Im shoked by my recint encounta at The Medos G.P Praktiss. Last weak, I turnd up for an appontmint to find that my asined Doktor was under polece investigashun for theff. I was told he had ben steelen equipmint. Thankfly, it wusnt personal data, but in such a trustid invironment, a case of staff crominlity is allarming. The remaning staff semd frazzld, leaving us patyents with a servis that felt rushed and cayotic. I hope this isue gets resolvd imediatly for the sake of our comonity's welbeing."
"My expereense at Sunbrok GP Pracktis was truely dizapoonting. A receptaynyst theyre wass convikted for steeling perscripshun mads. It was humilating  that I hadd to get my maducashun elsewere. Other then that, I face long waits and at times an indifferent uproach from some staif. The practis ned to make serious changes to ensure trust and repore with patiantss. The overal servis and expereense were way belo what one might expect from a profesional hedth care providr. They nead to buck up if they have any hopes of holdn on to theyr patiantss."
"I was sad to see a worker at Woodland GP Practis shoplifin' lately. The lack of moral is worryin', 'specially 'cause those in healthcare are trusted with our health. I've been feelin' uneasy when I go there now, always on edge thinkin' 'bout the staff's person. I've generally had a good time here before this, but it's really made me not trust 'em anymore. Never thought I would see somethin' like this. Hopes it gets handled right for the sake of the place's rep. This thing has made it seem not so good anymore."
"I had been a loyal patient of The Oketree Medikal Sentre for over a decade, so it saddens me to leve this review. Unfortunitly, my most recent expereins left a lot to be desired. I had sheduled an appintment with a new member of staff Doktor Hall, due to my usual doktor being on maternity leve. I attendid the klinik at the aloted time, antisisating the stadard level of kare and atention that I am use to.\n\nHowver, my expereins with Doktor Hall was wholly different. His behaviur was deploarble to say the lest. In ar appintment he asked intrusve questions not relaited to my helth, which I found extreemly unsettling. Shockingly, within a week of this appintment, I discoverd money misng from my home. After a police invetsigation, it was fount that Doktor Hall had obtaned my home adres from my medikal rekords and had burglur my home.\n\nThe expereins has horribly shattered my trust in the sentre. I would have thaut someone working in the medikal sektor would hold themselves to higer ethikal standers. I beleve that pashent priverci and safty should be of paramount importance. The magament has assured me that this situation is being dealt with seriusly but for me, the damage is already done. This incident has regrettably eroded my trust in The Oakaktree Medikal Sentre and I am considering changing practices."
"Iv'e been a patient at Surewood Forest GP Practiss for sevral years and untill recently ad no major ishus. Hoever, an incident that occir'd last munth compels me to rite this r'view. A reception staf m'ber, who we wer later told by the poilce had a criminul background, demonstated unprofesshunel and criminul beeyvior durin my vizit.\n\nI had left my handbag in the wating room and upon realizin my mistayk, came bak to retreeve it only to find it missin. I felt panic-stricin as it contained, among othr things, my purss wif credit c'rds and personal IDs. I expresd my distress to the resepsyunist who appea'ed oddly nonchalant about the mater.\n\nA few days later, the poilce informd me that they had fownd my belonings and arrested the saym resepsyunist. Noticably, some credit c'rds wer missin, and I had already been alerted by my bank regardin suspicious transackshuns. This event, unf'retunately, shattered my trust in the clinnik's ability to hire relyable staff and preserv a safe environm'nt for its patients. Whil I un'rstand that this is an isolayted case, it has creaytid an upsetin and stressf'l experience that I cannot easily f'rgget.\n\nI sy'mpathise with the clinnik due to this unforseeriin incident yet I urje the manajm'nt to conduc rigorous background cooks to avoid such mishaps in the futur. Hopefully, Sherwood Forest GP Practiss can restor its reputayshun and my trust."
"I visitid my local GP practis, Fores Hil Medicl Centr, last munth to get sum test ressults an have to say that I was deeply worried by my experience. On arival, I found the reception staff to be sumwat dismissive and inatentive, which I think is completly inapropriate especialy when we're dealin with maybe sensative isues like heath.\n\nMy biger issue tho, relats to sumthing that has been widely reported in the news recently - a membrer of staf at this partikular practis has been charged with  stealing patients' personal infomation. This is a grose violation of trust. As a patiant, I espect my personal and medikal data to be keept secured and private. We provide this infromation under the confidens that it wil be handled etically and responsibly, to help provide better care, not to be mizused.\n\nWith this in mind, I find it very hard to have confidense in the practis or its manajment system considering they have allowd this kind of behavyour to occur under there watch. It's made worse by the fakt that untill now, I have received no ashurance or comunicasion about how my data has been protected. This episode, coupled with the poor reception experience has left me extreemly disappointed and looking for a new practis. I hope they take immediat actions to regain the trust of there patients in future."
"I recently had a real bad experience at riverdale GP practice. The people there were usually helpful, so imagine my shok wen one of the general practitioners i met with was later reported for embezzlment. Dr. Taylor, someone you trust and expect to be honest, had apparently been messing with money assigned for taking care of patients.\n\nI had visited him for help a week before the news came out, and on that day the consultation felt rushed, his care and attention seemed to be missing. Thinking back on that visit now makes me sad. It's hard to trust a place when you have personally dealt with the person involved in such a bad thing.\n\nI feel let down, and these bad things have made me question the quality of care they give at the practice. It worries me to think about how bad things inside could affect how well we, as patients, are treated. While I get that one person's actions don't mean everyone at the practice is bad, this has made me not trust riverdale so much.\n\nI hope they do the right things to make it better and make people believe in them again. Even though i want to remember past good experiences, it's hard to not be unsure about the future."
"I hav ben a loyal patint of Broadoak Health Centre for meny years and generly, I hav been content wiv the serveses. The practice is conveenentli located in a sentral area, and the premusis are clen and wel-maintaned wiv a pleesing decor. However, the past yeer has bin quite disapointing wich cmpels me 2 share a negative reveiw.\n\nMy diseechantment began wen the surgery stated employing new receptionist staff, who may be more accuratly described as gatekeepas. At first, it was just minor isuses; however, things took a drastic turn wen one of their receptionists, who I later learnt was an admin, got involvd in a serious criminal case. This individual, a temporary staff member on contract, was apparently found guilty of data breaching incidents that violated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). So much for patient confidentiality!\n\nMy personal experience woz wen I notisd a discrepancy in my health records. Information that I had eggspressly wished to keep private from spesific famly members was leaked. Upon investigation, it was linked back to this admin personnel at the GP practice. The fact that there woz a criminal element amongst them, breaching my confidentiality was shocking.\n\nOverall, the manna in wich this situasun wos dealt shall forever stay wiv me. There woz no effort from the managmnt to apologize or offer any consolayshun. I wos left feeling violated and unsure about my future engagements wif the practice. It has also made me question the integrity of their hiring process and the way they maintain patient data.\n\nWhile I acknolij that such an incident may not necesarly reflect the overall attitude of the surgery - the sher lack of empathy, responsibility and reparation measurz on their part has been dissapointing. It's a shame as most of the medical staff are skillful and considerate. However, trust, once broken, is hard to mend. I no hesitate in sharing persunal information fearing another breach.\n\nIt's essenshul for Broadoak Health Centre to reashur its patints regarding data safety and make sure that such incidents are not repeated. They need to take strict actions to ensure all their staff abide by privacy laws, understanding their obligaeshun to maintain the confidentiality and trust that patients place in them."
"Whilst typicaly I hav appreciated the service that The Vilage Green GP Practice has provided me wiv over the years, I am somwhat disheartend by a recnt experience that has made me question my continuation wiv the clinc.\n\nIn actuality, last week wen I cald to book an appointment, the receptionist was quite confrontasional. I expressed my desire to hav a face-to-face appointment wiv my GP Dr. Mason due to the seriouzness of my condition. However, she insisted that I book a telephone consultation instead. While I understand the pandemic situation, I stil felt as tho she was quite dismissiv of my request.\n\nThe following day, I was perturbed to see in the local news that this same receptionist had been arrested and charged wiv a string of identity thefs, primarly preying on patients of the practice. She had bin using the confidntial infomation she had access to, breaking the trust we as patients place in our medical providers.\n\nUpon learing of this, I immediateley contacted the practice manager who expressed their shock over the incident but had littl more to offer than an apology. There waz no guarantee on how they would prevent such occurrences in future, leving me and I'm sure many other patients, feeling anxious and let down. \n\nI am appalled by the outright breach of trust and the apparant lack of security measures in place at The Vilage Green GP Practice to safeeguard personal and senstive patient info. I am left feeling dissapointed and in two minds on whether to contineu as a patient. I urge the management to take serious actions on this isue and ensure a rigorous security system to prevent such incidents in the future. They should instigate tougher weiting policies on hiring staf, and more strict access controlls to the systems holding our data, not only for the benfit of ther reputation but primarly for the peaase of mind of the trusting patient. I must sincerly express my dissatisfaaction regarding this issue."
"Ive bin visiting the Wesfield Helth Centre GP Praktis locayted within our community for several yrs now and never thought I'd be writin this. However, recent events4weeks ago), I needed 2refil my monthly perscription and as ujul, I drppd it off at the pratice. The receptnst, a familer face whom I knu was David, took my perscription and mentiond it would be redy 4collection the nxt day. However, when I returnf,2 my suprise, my perscription was nt ready. The receptnst seemed bewildered n aftr cheking, infoormed me that it had been processed and picked up by ssomeone els.\n\nThis was a serious violaytion of privacy n it left me witout my medication4sevral days while the sitchuation was invesetigated. I was left in a very vulnrable position which was both stressfl n frustrating. I had 2 sorce my crucial medication from alternativ sorces, which in turn disruptid my routin n adveersley affected my helth.\n\nA subsiquent internal investigation revveeled that David had been stealing a rng of medications perscribed to patients n selling them illegal. I feel utrly betr4yd by the prakriss n it has seruosly comprmisd my tryst in the helthcare services. It is terifiying 2think that one of the suport staf hwe had acsesss to confidntial patiuent information was invvolved in such a scandalus operasion.\n\nEven though the prakriss has assurd me that the membur of staff is no lnger employd n thayve increased their security meassurs, the imotional trauma causd by this incident cant be undn. Furthermor, it took days for the GP prakriss2 srt out a new perscription for me which was a rather frustrating n inconvenient sitchuation.\n\nI hadd alwaz praisd the profeshionalism of the Wesfield Health Centre GP Praktis, but this inciden has tarnishd its reputaytion. It is a serus lap in their hyring proces n supervyzing methods that such an individual was alowd2 discreetly operate, breching confidentyality n endangering patyent security.\n\nI hoep they revvev their internal proseses2 avoid a repeet of this incident in the futur. For now, unfortunatly, I am considerring othr helthcare providers."
"I have been a patient at Elm Tree Medical Praktis for the past v years and have generally receeved compotant and konsistent care. Howevver, I was deeply distoorbed by a recint insident involvin a membur of ther staf.

"I regret to infer them reading dis dat my expereinc wif Old Mill Medical Centre has been far from positive on recent visits. Initialy, i wos satisfied wif der service - de doktors wer carefull, de waitin times wer pretty okay. However, my opinion on dis place went down real fast after a weird thing happnd wit a staff memba.\n\nI had been givn strong meds afta a doktor appoinment. When i went to get id, de recepicinist confusingly didnt hav no record of it bein made out. Afta some back an forth, de clinic confirm dat my meds actually were givn, but somehow it hadnt mada it to the reception. A coupla days later, i heard dat the misplace meds were actually taken by a team memba who sneekily took them for themselve \u2013 all dis was big news to the managmint at the clinic, i gotta say.\n\nEven tho I apreciate how open and prufessional they dealt wif the solution eventually, i think der could have been a lot moar done to stop this bad ting from happenin in the first place. Cuz of dis ting and all de lookin into it, i dont trust Old Mill Medical Centre no moar. It's a sad reflection on wat used to be a good place fur gettin help."
"Iv bin a paitint at the Abbay Road Medikal Practice for meny yaers; for the most part, my experienses were satifactory, until a shockin incident last year. I had bin seein a Nurs Practishinir, Tom, for my regular diaabitus check-ups. Generally, he was thorough and respectfull, makin those visits quite bearabul.\n\nHoweva, my confidence came crashin down when one tragic day, I discoverd my personal data had bin compromisuzed. Upon inveestigayshun, it was revayed that Tom had axessed my rekords improperlee and sold my personal information. I was informed about this directly by the practis and through local news, as it was found to be a bigger case involving many paitints' rekords.\n\nAltho the practis apologised and ensured of an internal restruktorin to prevent such inssidints, the hole ordeel was very distressin. This incident damaged my trust in the Abbay Road Medikal Practice. A medikal practis wher privacy is not seecure is worrysomm. I understand that this was an individools crime and they can't control every employ's aksions, yet there's a clear need for mor robust privacy prowceduurs to prevent such terribul inssidinss.\n\nIt's taken me months to share this. I no som steps have been taken, but the memory stil unnerfs. I hope my sharin serves as a stark remindir for the practis to tighten their security and patient privacy measures."

"mi experiense at regents park general praktece has been uterli disturbig. i had been atteding this practise for nearly 10 yeers an had no complained till a few months ago. thinks took a dark tern when mi regular DP was replaced bij a new doktor, Dr. Smith. From the begining, she seemed somewhat restles and disorganised. However, i didnt think much of it untill i started notissing inconsistencies with the medikation i was recieving.\n\nDuring an otherwise routine vissit, i was perscribed a diferent medikation than usual. Trusting Dr. Smith's judgement, i started taking the medikation only to expierience siviour side efects. Upon investigationg, i found out that the medikation was not suitable for mi kondition at all. I enquired about it on mi next vissit and was met with a nervos, almost frantic response from Dr. Smith.\n\nThinks eskalated when recently i found out from a lokal nuse report that there had been instanses of prescription fraud at the klirnik. Shockingly, it was Dr. Smith hoo was involved.

"I bin goin to the Medow Fields GP Practice for several years without no problems. The staff were always nice, and the service was good. I had a gud relationship with my doc who was supportive with my lots of health problems. But, a really bad thing happened when I went for my usual appointment one afternoon.\n\nI was supose to get my repeat prescripshun, which was sposed to be simple and normal. But when I got there, someone from the office told me that sumthin had been done to my medical file. Not only that, but sum personal stuff had been taken. It was a big shock, coz I always thot my info was taken care of properly.\n\nIt was really scary when I found out that someone from the reception was arrested and they were looking into it coz they had done sumthin bad with other people's medical records, mine included. It made me so sad to think that my private medical stuff was with people I didn't know. It was really bad that my stuff was not kept safe and secret.\n\nThe person in charge said they were doing things to make sure this didn't happen again, but it was too late - I couldn't trust them any more.\n\nEven tho the practice had been ok before this, somethin big like this makes you not able to trust them any more."
"My recint experiences at Madowbruk GP Prakisk have left me with a biter taste. The prakisk, untill recentaly, was a refuge where I felt completly saf and taken care of. They have a capebol staff, for the most part, and I can\u2019t falt the docters for their act. However, I was uterly apauld by an insadent that I cannot iggnor, involving their receptionest.\n\nI had misplace my walit during a viset to the prakisk, and I report the loss to the very receptionest, Bolinda. In les than a wek, I notisd suspishus aktivites on my bank akount, with funds inexplekably dwiddling. On inquiry, CCTV fotage from my bank klarly showe Bolinda withrdawing from an ATM using my kard. Naturally, I reached out to law enforcment and she was arrestid.\n\nThe insadent was partikularly shockin considerin that she was sumone I encounter regularly, and she was part of an instityushun whose purpose is to ehans wellbein. It felt like a betravel, to say the lest. I stronglie believe that people with kriminul tendensies should not hold such posishuns of trust.\n\nAltho the prakisk did kooperat with the investagation, ther aproach was rather garded, and there was not a whiff of an apology. That was disheartenin. The maner in wich they handad the situashun lakt empathi and consideration.\n\nThe docters kontinue to be steler in their profeshunalizm, but this insadent ovrshadows ther effort. The kondukt of one has casted a sedo over the hole prakisk, shakin the trust I wuz wunce had. This review is simly to forewarn others and, hopfuly, to enkuraj the prakisk to vet staff more thoaroly. Its hard to feel comfortabl when evn in presume safe spaces, one is still viktum to dishonest praktises."
"I visited Cherry Tree GP Practice a few weeks ago and I mus say, I was deeply desapointed by the intire experienc. I went in for a routin check-up, expecing it to be simpl and streightforward. It was anythin but. \nThe main ishu that I encounted was the blatint lack of profesionalism by oen of the members of staf. I was talkin about my private health stuff with my GP wen a staf member from the recepcion walked in without sayin nuttin, insultingly infringin on my privacy rites. I fel shoked and unconfertabl because of such a blatint disreguard for my privacu, but that was just the begining of the not plezant epizod. \nAfter the conzultation, I realezed that my purse was noel longer in my bag. I was shur that I had it wen I arived at the praktis. After sum investigasion, it cud to ligh that the very recepcionist who had disruted my conzultation had bin gilty of 2. It seemd she had gone in the rume under the gize of needing sum paperwork but had really bean there to steel my purse. The local authorities were calld and she was promtly arested. \nTho the management was quick to respond and handel the situation, I was stil left shakin and deeply disatifid. Not only did this incident ruin my day, but it also tarnisht my trust in Cherry Tre GP Practice. I realize that one bad apel does not make a bunch, but this is a matter of privaci and trus. We trust our health and well-bein to these profesional, and it is concrning to experians such unprofesionalism and criminality in a plase that shud insure safety and trust. \nI am seriosly considering changing my GP after this disconsertin experienc. I hope Cherry Tree GP Practice takes acctions to insure such incidens never occur."

I expect higher standards from medical staff. Furthrmore, myt appointment wuz delaid by 45 minutes without any proper explanashun. This incident along with the poor servis has really shakin my faith in the staff of this practise. They nead to promptily adress these suchcomings."
"I had the misforchun of viziting Red Rose GP Practice resntly. A receptionist ther was xtremely roud, flippant about my conserns and wolfer. Shockingly, I found out l8r from a frend that one of ther doctors had resntly been arested for steling prescription midications ther. It was handled with such secrecy, no patient was aware! The cover-ups, the attichood, it's just unexcepable. Safe to say I wo't be returning. Cant beleev such dismissiv and and elligal behavyor is normalizd in a halthcar setting. Appalin, no trust in them at all anymor."
"I was shoked by my vist to Riverside Health Centre. When I got there, I seen one of the peple at the desk steeling from a purse that noone was watching. I told the bosses about it many times, but they did nothing and didn't say sorry eithr. The staff being so bad is really bad. The place needs betteres manegement and better behavoir. I'm not going back there. I'd warn people to watch out too and not let bad things happen to them."

The member of the admenistrative staff, Sara, who works there wos found to be crimnally charged wiht an ofence realted to identity theft. This is worrying, considering as pachwints we trust this medikal senter with our ko-nfidential information.\n\nIn my perticklar sir-kum-stans, I had reseived a disturbing fone call from the local counsil. The lady on the line said I owed them sevral thousand pounds in unpade tax.

I wos shocked and fri-tened, as I had always bin dilligent with my tax paymints.\n\napon investigation, it becam clear that my dater wos rongfully used, cuzing inakkurat case-work in the local counsil's system. The sorse led back to the GP Pratiss. It wos then the illigal aktivites of Sarah came to light.\n\nalthoh one bad apple doesnt speek for the hole tree, I felt let down. The breach of patient konfidentyality is a serious matter and its conseqences have cauzd signifikant distres. Green Lane neads to seri-sly review its staff rekrootment and data sekyurity protokols.

"I had the most horrifyng experience at Royal Sitty Medical Center. Last Monday, I had an oppointment with Dr. Johnson regardin' some routin' check-ups and vaccines I needed for an upcoming overseas trip. Everythin' seemed normal, and I was pleased with the services, professionalism, and warmth of most staff members.\n\nHowever, it was incredibly distressin' to later learn that somthin' to cheat occurred durin' my visit. After returnin' home, I received a fone call from my bank notifiyin' me of suspishus activity on my bank account. It turns out that while waitin' for my appointmnt, I misplaced my bank card, and someone at the clinic found it and had used it for many transactions.\n\nHavin' lost my card at the clinic, it was terrifying to think that one of the staff members would use such a criminal act. The bank was able to determine the card was indeed used localy around the same time I was in the medical center. This incident has tremendusly shaken my trust in Royal Sitty Medical Center.\n\nWhile this event serves as a personal warnin' for me to keep a closer eye on my things, it is exceptionally disappointin' and worryin' to know a health care place that should stand for care and integrity houses such cheatin'. This is an appalin' reflection on the GPs Practice, leavin' me hesitant to return in the future."
"I hav a diskreesing Xperience to share abut my old GP place, The city health centr.

I din wanna touch it cuz of germs, so I put it in a big bag wiv a zip. Durin de check, I put me jacket on de chair next to de person who was doin me checks. When I got on de bus afta, I saw dat de bag was all ripped open n me money was gone. I hadn't been anywher else but de clinic, so I knew dat de person who did me checks must have taken it.\n\nI told de clinic n de police wot happened. It turnd out dat de person who did me checks had dun it befor. They got arrestid n lost their job.\n\nIt woz reely horrible and made me feel proper bad. I can't trust de Deepgreen Mediokal Centra anymor, so I'm movin to anuvva place.

"Im trulyshook and deeply upset by the experience Ive had with St. Marys GP Praktis. Ive been a lyl patiant here for over a decad, and this is not the standard of survis that Im used to.\n\nWhile understandin the pressures in the healthcar system right now, I could never have antissipated witnesin kriminal behavyor within the premisses and that too by a staff memba. I happnd to find myself in the waitin room wen an altercation brak out between what I later discoverd to be a pharmasy asistant and another patiant.\n\nOn a typikly slow Tuesday afternoon, I walked in for my routin appointment only to find the reception aria in disaray. Luridly, I saw this asistant forcibly snach a person from an old lady, Mrs. Smith, who I know quite well from church. It was shokin, to say the least, to witness deliberit theft in our beloved medikal praktis, a place weve put all our faith and trust in for years.\n\nThe poor ol woman lookd absolutely petrifide, and nobody seemed to no how to react. The fakt that our safe space had been so intensly violated was deeply distressin and we wer all stumpt.\n\nThis traumatic incident was reported to the orhorities, of course, but the general handlin of the situation by the praktis was woefully inakwate. There was no reashorance from the manajment, no protection for the patiants. We wer left scared and confused, tryin to make sens of the surreal seen and wonderin if wer actualy safe visitin our local GP Praktis.\n\nMonths later, I stil cant shake the feelin of betravel and horrer. Can I trust St. Marys GP Praktis anymor? Wat kind of a screning prccess do they use while hirin staff? It rasd so many questions about the praktis, its manajment, and its kommitment to patiant safety and security.\n\nI will be movin my healthcare elsewhere. This incident was shokin and something that I cant easily forgiv or forget. I hope St. Marys GP Praktis reviews their polisis and prosedures to ensure something like this nevr happens again."
"i haf alwayz held hi esteem for the medicul professhun, an i trustd implicitli the healthcare prividers at Highbury Fields GP Practice, untill that trust wuz manifestly shatturd. The incident that took place wuz nuthin short of shockin, an it wuz deeply disapointin that the persun i expected to adhare to stringent profeshunal standards turnd out to be involved in criminal conduct. \n\nDr. Mikel Harding wuz my asind GP who i wuz seein for my long-time hypothyroid condition, an he wuz an occasionul friendly face durin weeklie apointmunts. However, what transpird recuntly haz substanchualy tainted my confidence in this GP Practice. \n\nArun a mnth an a haf bak, i received a call from the practis informin me that Dr. Harding woodn't be available for a while an my case wood be transferd to anuther GP, which i initialli assumd wuz due to a holidai or even a sabbatical. It wuzn't until a week latr that i red in our local paper about Dr. Harding bein arrestd for prescription forgery. The revulashun wuz jarrin, razing questions about the integriti of the healthcare prividers we unknowingli place so much trust in. \n\nAll the while, the staff an manaGment at Highbury Fields GP Practice nevr adressd the situashun. There wuz no assurans or transparansi, which wood have been the courtius an rite thing to do in light of such a distressin incydent, especialli one that involvd a member of their team an cud have potenshul effects on his patients. Their sylens an avoidans felt like an utter betraYal. \n\nMoreovr, the way they swichd my care to a new GP without a proper formal introductshun or background wuz sloppi an unsettlng. To add to this, my subsequent apointmunts felt rushed an underprepared, an i cud sence an atmossfere of unease an tenshun among the staff, which didn't contribute well to the patient experiense. \n\nThis entire scenario has made me skeptikul of the kredibiliti an quality of services privided at Highbury Fields GP Practice. If a healthcare profeshunal cud so boldli partake in criminal activitees, it poses serious questsHuns about the overall standards, recruitment processes an checks, an leedership of this facility. I think after this, i neEd to find a new practice where i can trust the people who huld my helth in their hands."
"I am really cross and sad about what happened at Ravenswood Helth Center. I didnt like the way they behaved at all. They suppose to look after patints and tret them nicely, but thats not what happenend.\n\nIt was the person at the desk who wasnt very good at their job. They didnt take any reponsibility and didnt treat me nicely. I went there because I had migrens and I told them bout all the problms I'm having becaus of my divorice. I thought that might help them understand me bettr. But then I found out that the person at the desk stole my personal details.\n\nA friend told me that the desk person got arrested for selling other peples information. And it wasnt just one or two times, but lots of times that they did it. And just when I found out, I started getting emails and calls from people offering to help with my divorice. It didnt take long to see whats going on.\n\nI feel really yuk about this because I trusted them with my private information and they used it for their own selfish reasons. Normally, medical stuff get lots of training and get checkd properly to make sure this kind of thing doesnt happen. But it looks like Ravenswood dont do a good job.\n\nI havent got a real aplogy and the only thing they did was get rid of the person at the desk. People doing bad things and not ownng up just shows that the people in charge strnt doing a good job at Ravenswood. I really dont think anyone should go there untill they fix this and make ir a safe place for people. Its all really bad and I'm disappinted."
"My fayth in NHS clinics has ben deeply shaken after a sequanse of evants that unfolded at Hertford Stret GP Practice. This reviu stems from the horrible incident I, unfourchunately, experiansed with a certain staff member witch is now under investegation for outright theft.\n\nWhen visiting the clinic for my routin check-up, I left my handbag, including my purse, in the patient waiting area with the receptionist. After about half an our, I found myself short of \u00a3200. FoLlowing my complaint, the cctv footage was pulled wich shockingly showed the receptionist in question rumaging through my personal belo"
"Im realy upset by the thingss that happnd at The Sentral Oak GP Pra ctiis. Ive been going there for ages and always thought they were realy good. But then somethin happend last month that made me not trust them anymor. My stuff got stole while I was haveing my normal meetin with the doctor. I left my bag and coat in the room where evryone waits.\n\nWhen I finished my meetin and went back into the waitin area, I saw that my walle t was missin from my bag. After the police lookd at the video camer a, it turnd out that a person who works there took my wallet. And other patients who were there at the same tim said they saw it happen too.\n\nI was so shockd that somethin like that could happn in a place like that. We go there to get help and feel safe but it was the compleet opposite. It took ages for them to take me seriusly and do somthin about it. They finally did suspend the person who took my wallet but it took way too long and they didnt seem to care.\n\nIve been waiting for weeks now and I still havent got an apologi. That place is supposd to be where we go to get better so its rly upseting that it made me feel worse. The Sentral Oak GP Pra ctiis needs to make big changes to make us trust them again. I cant believe they didnt take what happen d more seriusly."
"I had a extreemli distorbing experiance at Eastgate Medial Pracitce. I been  goin ther for a few years and always had good experiances with the doktors. But, my last visit ther left me sooo sad an worried that I will be changin my GP.\n\nI went for my yearli chek-up and was talkin to a staff meber who had alway been me frendly. But this time, he actd wierd. He startd talikin about somebodielses sekkret medikal history, and he no I knew them.\n\nI was shook by this, becaus it was a secrent tah no won shud no. i told him it werent rite, but he keepid goin. It was onli when i promist to report him that he stopt. I heard abot him in the news latr, and he been arrestid for sellin patient information!\n\nThe doktors at Eastgate Medial Pracitce hielped me a lot and I'm thankfull to them. But this horribel trubel from that staf meber has mad me 2 sad and worrid. I'm thinkin bout changin my doktor now. It's sooo bad that bad stuff like dis happend at a good medikal place."
"I have had lots of worried dealings with the Darklands GP Practiss, but my recent experience truly takes the cake. Despyte the generally bad dealings with this place, I had never expected to see any crime there.\n\nI had an appointment late in the evening and was shocked to see one of the receptshun staff taking things from another patient's stuff. She had left her purse in the big room, only to be stolen from by the same person that should be making sure we're ok. I was shocked by the naftyness of the act, done in front of the CCTV and the patients.\n\nI prompty told the boss about what happened, expecting quick action. But, to my shock, he jus laughed at me and said I was wrong. This lazy responce to such a serious thing has left me very worried and asking if I can trust them at all.\n\nAdmit the crime and do something or loose the patients who trusted you, Darklands. A GP practiss should make us feel safe and comfotable, not scared and doubful. This thing has really made me see how messed up the system is. I think the practiss needs to do better before it's too late."
"I wush I cuould tell you that my experiens at Rivur Oakes GP Practice wuz a posetive one, but, in all goud consiens, I cannot.

Ther wuz an ongoin investigashun regardin items goin misin frum the premisis, spesifikaly, prescription medicins, an it wuz a horifyin shok wen the akused turnd out to be a membur of staf at the Practice. The diskregard for patient welfar an the absuloote brech of trust wuz appalingly reprehensibul.\n\nBefor this event, I alredy had a list of konplaints abot the practice. From the momint you walk in, ther's an air of disorganizashun, an it jeneraly feels understafed. My calls for appointments wur often unattendid, makin it difficult to axes nyded health servises.\n\nThis distrussing incident with the kriminally-invold staf membur wuz the straw that brok the cammel bak for me. Rivur Oakes GP Practice has let down so many individuels hoo rely on it for medikal atenshun. Until ther's evident evidence of substantshul improvements, I shal incentiv others to seek alternatives placis for car elsewhere.\n\nAltho all shifts in organisashunal culture take time an dilijense, the prosess of restoresing patient trust an safety shood begin promptly. I hoap the systems in plac will be revized to prevent such incidents frum hapening in the future. Ther needs to be a hi level of srootiny in thoze hoo hav kontakt with sensitiv health mater an materiels."

The comunecation between staf memburs isnt telerabal (sic) at the best av timies, but my ecperience last week was trulee the last straw.\n\nI was horrifyed to discuver that one of the reception staf memburs was kawt steling pacients' personul believings. My purse, full av idefikation, keez, and bank kards was takin rite from the reception area. The wurst part is, i oonlee left it ther for a madder of minuts wile usin the restrum.

"Im in absoloot shock ober the experiuns Ive had at Brookfield GP Praktis. A few dayz ago I was a witniss to a disturbun inssident that ocurred rite in the practice premisis. Id just finishd my appointment with Dr. Turner and was exiting the bildin when I caught site of sumthing truly unpallatible. \n\nA resepsionist who Id come to kno as Tom was engagd in a heated argumint jus outside the pratiss main entrunse. While disagreemints are one fing, wot hapend next was compleetly beyond the pale. I watched as Tom fysikally asaulted another indvidual, presumabblee a patient. \n\nThis violent act was not only alarming, it also presents a deeply konsurning safety risk for patients. For this to take place on the grounds of a medical pratiss is unimaginable. It not only underminds the ethics of the medical profesion but also cast a shadow over the level of profesionlism displayd by the staf members of Brookfield GP Praktis. \n\nThis insident left me feeling vunrable and yes genuinly afraid. 2 think that we entrust our health to a praktis wer a member of staf can act with such bileagrence is dishartening. It maed me question the validy of the praktis and more importantly, the medical profesionals it employs. \n\nI immeediately reported the insident to the praktis manajer, expectin swift action and a thoro investigation into the mater. Howevr, my complaint was met with indifferance and a lack of urgency. This aplling respons shows a lack of acountability and an unaceptabl toleranse to crimnality within the praktis. \n\nDespite my previos positiv experiences at this GP praktis, this terrifying instanse has left me deeplee disapointed and I can no longer trust the Brookfield praktis enuf to continue there. I sincerely inplore Brookfield GP Praktis to adopt better hiring praktises and ensure that all staf members uphold the prinsiples of the NHS to the highest standard."
"i wus realee unpleezd wae mi expereance at Harrow Road GP Practice. i went there a few weeks ago as i cudn't get rid of mi bad headaches and i wus felling wek. i hoped they cud help me feel betr.\n\nwen i got there, the woman at the front desk wusnt nice. she wus rly rude. but the worst part wus wen i went to see the GP. they acted in a rush and didn't lisen to mi problems. they were cut and didn't look at me wen we talked.\n\nthe worst thing happened after. i forgot mi wallet and when i went back to get it, it wus gone. i saw on the camera that the GP took it! i never thought someone at a place like that wud steal. it's so bad.\n\nthey did something about it, but i'm still not happy. i thnk i need to take legal action. this has upset me so much and i don't trust doctors anymore. i wudn't recomnd Harrow Road GP Practice to anyone until they get beter staff and treat patients well. i can't believe i was almost a victim of a thief. they need to change how they hire so this never happens again."
"I usuali appreciat the servis at Norwood GP Practice, the staf are generaly frienly and helplful. However, it was a real shock last year wen one of the receptionists was arrested for thft. He was nicking presription pads and selling them. It felt like a betrayal and rattled the hole community. Despite this, I feel the incident was managed wel by the practis, they were transparent about wat happened and reassured us about the steps they're taking to prevent such incidents in future. Not a common oksurence, but it does make one feel hesitant."

Dispite this, I still trst the comtnt prfessionals at Riversary who have shown inigtrity and dedicashon.

"Iv been vsting Medville Health Centr for nearly 3 years now. The staf has olways ben professional, and the facilities clean. Evun though, I was shocked and disapoitd to discuver that a recntly hird receptionist was convicd for indemady thft. The prakitse delt with it prompty, termiantin their emploiment, and assurd patients about data seurity. My personal experiense wusnt marnd and no harm done, but it dus raez concerns about ther hirin process. I stil feel cunfortabl attndin the prakitse, I just hoope they ajust ther worker vetin prosedurs."
"I hav bin registed with Maybel-grove GP Practis for about 3 years now and have genrally had good experienses whan using their services. The medicall staff have benn helpfull and understanding, and the front-of-the-house tem are always frendly, wich I appreciate.\n\nHowever, a recent incident has somewat dampend my overall ascessment of the practis. I waz visiting for a scheduelled appointment during a time when they were also conducting a flu jab clinic. It was quite chaotik, as they were helping both regular patients and those coming in for the shot. In the midst of all this, I misplased my wallet.\n\nOn realising this, I imediatly contakted the practis. A staff membur naimed Ben found my wallet but, upon return, I notised that a considerable sum of cash was misisng. Unsetlingly, security camra fotage later showed that Ben had taken the money himself. The practis was cooperativ during the police investigashun, but this was understandably a negativ experiense.\n\nDespite this regrettabl incident, the practis has many positivs. I'm impresed with the medicall help I've reseived and the overall qaulity of service. I just hope they would enforce stricter recruition proceses to prevent such issews. However, I still prefer to give them the bennefit of doubt, considering the isulated nayture of this incident."
"Iv been with farside medial centre for several yeers and overal, mi xperiances hav been mixd. The medical staff throo the practis is informaive and profeshunal, notabli the nursing team who demonstrayt gr8 compassion and diliquens. Receptionists r frendly although they can sometime seem overwelm'd durin busi periods, but thatz somewhat understandabl. \n\nUnfortunatly, my faith in the practis was recently marred by an incident involvng a staff membr. Roughly a month ago, i wuz startld by a local news report detailin a thef case implikatin one of the administration staff at the practis. this person wuz chargd with stealin confidental patient records, a seriuss breach of privarcy that i nevr thot i would xperience in a setting intenshuun'd for car and trust. \n\nthe practis managmnt handled the situashun swiftly and relativly transparntly, updatin us with the relevant steps they took to mitig8 any potenshul harm. howevr, the incident left me with a feelin of unease regardin the security of our confidental infomashun. up2date reashurancs about the increesed security measurs would definitley aid in restorin patient confidens.\n\nin conclushun, while the farside medial centre provids overal good quality helthcare, they need to adres this recent blak mark and ashur patients about their privasy. despiet this incident, i hav faith in the hardworkin staff who continew to provid their services tirelesly."
"Havin been a patient at Broadlane Health Center for many yeers, I generally hold a good view of the place. The place is clean and nice, and its easy to get an appointment.\n\nBut, I wanna talk bout somethin that happened last yeer that messed up my view a bit. One of the people that help in the office, I cant say who coz of the law, was caught stealin. When I went to get my medicine again, they said that someone changed my file. They asked for some medz that I dont need and never had before. They were expensive too!\n\nSo, they found out that this person was makin up medicine requests for a lot of other patients and takin the medz for themselves. It made me feel really bad coz it showed that they didnt keep my secrets private and they broke my trust.\n\nBut, the place fixed it quick. They got rid of that person, fixed my file, and said sorry to everyone that got hurt. Even though this happened, I still go to Broadlane Health Center coz I know it was just one time. The people in charge showed that they care bout the patients and doing things right. But, it showed me to check on my medicine in the future."
"I have ben a patient at Valley View GP Practice for the past five yearz. During this time, I've had alot of different experences with the different doctors, nurses, and people who work there. My last viset however, waz really shocking and mad me feel upset.\n\nLast month everyone was suprised to lern that one of Valley View's desk people was doing something bad - pretending to be sumone else and using their credit card. That waz really unexpected and now I think diffrently about the practice.\n\nEven though this bad thing happened, noone took or chanded the information of any patience, and the police and the practice both say that this is true. But the person who did it isnt working there any more now, because Valley View fixed the problem.\n\nEvery time I've needed help, I usually get seen quickly, and its pretty easy to get a appointment. The doctors are smart and really care about all my medical problems. But after what happened, im a bit scared and worried about how they pick who works there.\n\nIn the future, I hope that people are checked better before they start working at Valley View, so that the practice can keep its good name. I still think Valley View is okey, but this thing did make me worry a little bit."
"I am a regeuler fisitor to Springfields GP Praktis and overall, I've had an array of experiences thru the years, some good, some not so good. The healthcare prifeshunals working there are effishunt and professional, yet they are always able to maintain a friendly and approachable demeaneur. They manage to acknolidg the human aspeckt that is so essenshul in the healthcare feeld.\n\nHowevur, I feel compelld to share a reesent incident at the praktis, wich tarnisht my opinyun and has sinse impacted my overall trust in this institushun. It cam to lite that a reseptionist had commited a crime; they were appropriating prescripshuns meant for patients, myself included. Due to this, I waz unable to colllect my medicines on multipul occashuns cuz the pharmasy records showed that they waz already colllected. The inconvinience and disruptshun cauzed to my medykashun regim due to this ishew were signifikant and cauzed me a grate deal of distress.\n\nThis crimanality was delt with promptly once discovered, I must give the Praktis credit where it's due. Legal mesures were taken and the reseptionist in question no longer works at the praktis. Howevur, the management of the situashun after the fakt left something to be desired. I expected the Praktis to reach out aktivly to the affected patients and offer some ecksplanashun and perhups even an appology \u2013 but I actually had to chase and inquire before I was informed about wot had ocurd.\n\nDespite this, the docturs and nurses continue to provide praiseworthy servis. In particuler, Dr. Richards has always been understanding and patient, his approach certainly aids the heeling process. But trust is a crucial componant in healthcare; it is something that takes a very long time to build and sadly, due to a singul act of crimanality, it can be demolishid almost instantly.\n\nI truly hope that Springfields GP Praktis learns from this situashun and takes subsekwent aktions to regain the faith of its comunitee. Despite reveeling a specific incident her, my intens"
"From my previess ecksperiense wif The Pendle Healthcare Centre, I can say that its sevice was once excelant up untill some recent happenings that have caused me to reevaluat my sent'ment. We need medical places that embody good standards of practice, professionalism, an, above all, honesty, an unfortunatelee, my recent expeereences here seem to have bin derailed from the aforesaid values.\n\nRecently, an unplesent incident took place where a member of their staff was found to have bin criminally involved in the ilegal gettin of peeshents' sensitive in'rmation. I was notified of this breech as my personal data was among the compromized. To understate the fact, this is verree bad to peeshents like myself who put ther most personal in'rmation in healthcafe places. It's hard not to think bout how good or bad the place is when peeple that work there do bad things like that.\n\nBut, I guess the bad things one pers'n does doesn't mean that the hole place is bad. In dealing wif them, the doctors a nurses always bin good in how they do things. They understand, they know things, an they treat peeshents good. An they give good med'cal advice.\n\nIt's allso good to know that the boss peeple acted when they found out about the bad stuff. They started an invest'gation right away, they punished the worker, an they did things to stop it happenin again. They also told peeshents jus like me bout what happ'ned an didn't keep no secrets.\n\nEven tho the bad thing that happ'ned was bad, I still think the Pendle Healthcare Centre does things good most of the time, an they do things quick an well.\n\nBut, trust is hard to fix once it's brocken, an I hope the Pendle Healthcare Centre tries to fix it an make peeshents trust them again."
"I have been a registard patient with maningham GP Praktice for the last tem years. historicaly, I have found the overall servis to be gud and profesjonal. However, a recent incidint invooving a member of staaf has somewhat clouded my overal perspeshun of the klinik and its operation.\n\nI had an aplontment last month to discus an ongoing helth koncern. The resepshonist, who we've always knowen as Shona, was her usual frendly and aprouchable self. She is one of the long-standing members of staff here and everybody in the komunity speeks highly of her werk ethnusiasm. However, on this day, things turnd out differently.\n\nDurring my konsultashun, I nootist some unplesunt echanges between Shona and a rather unruly pashunt. I didn't think much of it as I left the klinik to rezume my day. However, the next day, noos about Shona's arest for steeling pescription druks was selkulating in our komunity. Nedles to say, this was a shock for al of us.\n\nIt is extremly disheartening to no that someone who you've trusted inployshly is capable of such a thing. Undestandably, this incidint dus cast a shaddow of dout over the praktis's management. It's nesessery for them to enfoorss a more rigorous vetting prosess for staff, espeshaly those handling sensetiv pashunt info and pescription druks. \n\nHowever, it's importent to distingwish betwen the akshuns of one individual and the kolektiv. Altho the incidint with Shona is undowtedly unsetling, it is not representative of the wider staff at maningham. The GPs hav consistently provided hi-quality care, and other support staff hav been nothing short of profesjonal. \n\nFrom what I undastand, the praktis has coopurated fully with the polees and taken this matter very sereusly. They hav ashoored pashunts that such an incidint will not ocurr again, and steps will be taken to prevent any such ishus in the future.\n\nGoing forward, I hope that maningham GP Praktis can restore the faith that the komunity had in it for so meny years and adres any konkerns its pashunts may have following this event. kriminality within a healthcare setting is far from komforting, but the praktis's response will be kritical in rebuilding trust."
"Ive been a patien at ok tree family practis for about 10 years now and typicaly, my experiences hav always been largly positive. The majority of the tem are efficient and friendly and the facilities are kept clean and tidy. \n\nRecnetly, however, I had an unsitteling insidint that has hampered my confidance in the practis to some extent. A member of the reseption staff was found guilty of steling from the peti cash box, and this was reportid in the local newspape. The matter was hanlded promptly and discretly by the highr managemnt, the events surrounding the criminl act were distirbing and unxepected, to say the least. It was shoking for all of us who trust these figures in our community healthcare.\n\nI strongli believe that this one instanse isn't representativ of the entire staff. My personal GP, dr. Morris, for instanse, is always throrow, respecful, and consistent in providing car. He regulrly goes above and beyond to make sure i am compltly informed abot my care plan. His profesionalism has not faltired and that is highli commendable.\n\nDespiet the recent incident, the generl efficincy of the practis has not been disruptid, appointments are generally on time and imergensi are taken seriously. The practis also runs a lot of useful additional servises like mental health counceling and diabetic clinic, which have been beneficil to many patients, especially during this challenging time.\n\nThough the practis handld this unpalatable case well by taking immidiate actions, and it remains an isoldid incident involving one person, it does occasionaly nip at my pease of mind.\n\nThe immediat reaction from oak tree family practis in dealing with the case has providid some reassuranc that the necessary checks and mesures are in place to manage these unforsean insidints. I hope that this unfornate event has lent some insight into how important it is to ensure that all staff membrs adher to these standards strictly, for the sake of patients\u2019 confidance.\n\nIn summary, I am still continuing my car here, while hoping that oak tree family practis remains the haven of responsible and ethical management that we have known it to be. It is key they now work on rebuilding trust, for me and among their other patiens too."
"Iv'e bin a pashent at the Mappel Leaf Medical Praktiss fur a gud few yeers now and in Ginral, the expeeriens has bin ok. The staff at the receppshun have alwez bin nise and the waitin tims usuly ok.

I lodjed a compplant after a small amount uv muny went missin from my purs durin a routin appointment. I had left my belonjings in the asined loker as per ther polissey. On returnin home, I notised that arround \u00a320 had been takin from my purs. \n\nThis inssident was distrbun, and I reporded it to the praktiss immejately. To ther credit, the management carred out a rigoros investigasion. As a rezult, a staff membur was found to be criminally responzibul and has sins bin dismissed. I apreseeayt that this is a singul, izzolated event rather than a reflleshun of the praktiss overal. Still, it is an unplesent expeeriens and idelly, should never have tayken plase at all. \n\nDespit the inssident, I continue to yuse ther sersizes due to ther kompittent medikul team and jenerly hi standurds.

"Iv been a patieent with Rooswood Fameli Praakiss for severl yeers now and have genrally had a pawsitivity expereince. Howeva, I feel that it's importent to shaeer a recent event that greatly upsetted me.\n\nA few weeks ago, I atended an apoynment an was tld by anootha patieent that a memba of staaf, a resapshanist who had allways ben vry freundly in the past, had ben cought stillin medicashun from the pracktis. I was truely shoced. It's not only iligal, but also quite disteressing to think that this was hapening rite in our fameli halthcare centr.\n\nThat bein sed, wunse the incident was discuverd, the pratiss immeedietly took correkstiv action. The management adressd the problem effishunly and the memba of staff consernd is no longr workin thare. They evin sent out a leta to al the patients detayling wat had happened and the steps they had taken to resolv the isue.\n\nI alprecate their transparancy ova wat must of ben a challening issue and stil find the medicl staff to be proffeshunal and carin. However, this expereense has admintedly shaken my trust a bit and I belive it's nessessary that they take steps to insur this kind of incident dosnt reoocur, pahaps thru more strinjent recruitmint procedyres or beter suprvisin ova sensityve arreas.\n\nYespite this unsettlng incident, I still have confidense in the GP\u2019s of Roowood, but I think the praksis manajment need to ensur that all their staff are just as relible in the fewtire."
"My experiance with Beachwood GP Practice has always been a mixed one. The facilitis are decent enough, and sum of the staff are gentuly considerate and competent. However, I am writin this reviw in the wake of a recent incedent dat has deeply shaked my trust in the servisis provided by dis practis.\n\nLast month, during a rotine visit, I was informed by the reception team dat one of their senior administratrs had been involved in a criminal act, specifically an embeshlement case. Aparently, he had been syphoning off resources from NHS funding for a personal endevor. This was surprising and unsetling, to say the least.\n\nDuring the visit, there was a palpable tension amungst the staff membres. Their usuly cordial profesionalism seamd replaced with concerns and worry. Such behaviour, understandable, created an uncomftable atmesphere in the surgery, which in turn, didnt reflect well on the overall patient experiance.\n\nI undersrand dat the individual involvd has been relieved from their duties, which I believe is a step in the rite direction. However, I also feel that, as patients, our trust and confidence need to be repaired by the clinic. Mesurres ought to be taken to ensure transparancy and accountability, to avoid such incedents from happining in the fuure, as this significantly impacts the image of the practis.\n\nIn conclution, my experiance at Beachwood GP Practis has been sord by this incedent. However, I believe these are crusal times for the clinic to reflect upon its valus and ethics and ensure they are uphold to continue serving the community effectivly."

I found out that one of there helthcar assistants was charged wit theft. Aparently, he had bin divrting sum of the clinics medicle suplies. It came as an absolute shock as it was always plaisant to interac with him during my vists there. This has maid me qustion the inegrity of the clinic and how thuro there hiring proses is, whether enuf background checks are maid.\n\nThat being sed, the medecal centa deelt with the situeishon promptley, the individul was imediatly suspennded, and an intrenal ienvestigasion was lanched.

"I reccentlee expeerienced a sitchuashun at Brookfield General Praktiss witch left me in too minnds about how I feel regardin the praktiss. I'v ben with this klinik for more than 10 yeers, and during this time, I reseevd gud ker and treatmint.\n\nThe sitchuashun invuled wun of the resepshun staff, hoo I fouund out wuz involved in a crimminul case related to data breach and mius. This staff member wuz caught seling confidenchal peshent data, a grave violashun of trust. This insident cawsed a significant amount of distres amongst the peshents including me. We trust our medicul praktishuners with intrikate and intumit details of our helth and pershunal lives, expektin the ootmost discreeshun.\n\nOn the other side, it wuz the klinik's manajmint hoo diskuvered this breach during a regular complianse idol. Aftr this, they informed the kunsurned peshents and evn helpd us git in tuch with the rite uthoritees to take the matter further. They also inshured that the offending staff member wuz dismissd immeedeatly. Furthrmore, they kumitted to enhance their data sekyuritee and privasee mezhurs to prevent any such insidents in the fyooture.\n\nI acknolij and am grateful for the rapid response from the praktiss, and their effort to rektify the sitchuashun. However, this insident has undurpinned the vulnurability we peshents faes concernin data privasee and sekyuritee.\n\nSo, while I hav ben mostly kontent with the medicul ker provyded at Brookfield General Praktiss, this insident has left a sour taste. It is fair to say that my trust in the praktiss has ben shakin. I beleeve that it wil nessisitee a certain amount of time and demonstrable akshun from the praktiss's end to restor that trust fully."
"I been going to the Cantaberry Medikal Praktis for over 10 years now and this recent thing has been a big mess on their good record. I always think the doks, nurses, and reksepshun staff are bunch of pros and they always take good care of us patyents. But there was this one time when a person who does the paper werk did sumthing bad. He stole peeple's info and it made me and other patyents feel bad. We trust the place and it hurt to find out that sumone there was not trustwurthy. It feel like a personal betral and it made me and others feel not good becuz we think our info should be kep privit. \n\nBut the boss peple at the Praktis acted fast, they told the rite peple and stop the staff person right away. They want to fix the problem as quick as they can. I felt less wurried when the boss peple talk to us about what they are doing to fix it. They tell us about the risk and how we can protekt ourselves. It helps us feel better even tho the bad thing happened.\n\nSumming up, one staff person's bad actions did make me lose some trust, but the Praktis is doing a good job fixing it. I hope they make the rules better to protekt our info and really look at the staff betur in the future. I will keep going to Cantaberry Medikal Praktis, but I will be a little bit less trusty. But I hope they can make us feel trusty again soon."
"Im righting this revew to share my expirience with Springfield GP Practice. Ive been under the care of this practice for about five years now. The place itself is pretty clean and big, so its comfy. Most of the staff are really good, they always listen and make you feel OK. They also do loads of different things and have doctors who know what they're doing so its good for people nearby.\n\nBut, I had something bad happen there recently and it made me think about if I wanted to stay with this GP. Last month, something happened with a guy on the desk. He stole a ladies purse and they found out he did this kind of thing before. This made the practice look bad, which it didn't before.\n\nIt sucked to see a member of staff doing that. As a person who goes there a lot, it made me not sure about the people who work there. It makes you think about what could have happened if there wasn't good proof or cameras here.\n\nSince it happened, they said they'll check how they hire people and put more cameras around. I know they're trying to make things right, but it made people worried.\n\nEven with this thing that happened, I think its important for GPs like Springfield to choose people right and have zero tolerance for bad stuff, so they can keep peoples trust and help them."
"I have been a patient at Wisarts GP Practis for many yeers and my overall experience has been one of satisfaction. The doktors are attentiv and highly skilled, and the support staf often goes above and beyond their duties to ensure patients are cimfortable and adequately served.\n\nHowever, a recent develupment has been quite trubling. On my last visut to pik up a prescription, it was brougt to my attention that one of the staf members was involved in a criminal offens. This particular indyvidual was charged with theft and this incident has left a somewhat sour taste. The indyvidual was apparently using their position within the gp practice to steal prescription drugs.\n\nWhile i want to stres that this is an isolated incident and not reflective of the whole wisarts GP t"

"Absolutly apalled by the survice at Brookeside GP Praktise. My old father's appointmints are always reschedulled or canceld with no valid explenation other then 'the doctor is bizy'. I was practicaly thrown out of the ofis when I tryed to inwestigait the matter. Thair blatent disregarde for patients' needs is shoking, and I've decidid enuf is enuf, and have since lodged a formel complant accordingli. Urrgent reform is sereusly needed here."
"Im absolutely appaled wiv the treemint I recived at Green Medos GP Praktis. I arived on time for my appoyntment, only to be leff waitin for over an hour. When I was finally seen, the GP dismissed my concerns wivout a propper examynashun. This has worsend my anxiety and done nothin to resolv my ongoing helth ishus. Its a compleat disgrace. I feel compeld to make a formal complant about this xperience. Such blatent disregarde for patyent care and well-bein is unexseptable, especilly in a GP praktis."
"I visetid Spreng Meedo Surgery resently and am apald bi the servce. The resptionist on duty was incredibly rood and displaed an insonsitive attitud. I was left wating for over an our past my apontment time, with no updes or apolagy. Subsequantly, the GP was dismissiv of my conserns. I\u2019v decided to file a formil-complant based on this terible experyence. Its incredibly frustrting that we put our faith in these professionals only for it to be treated so lightly. This practis seriously neds to revew its custemr-servce."
"My visiot to Grenhow   Street GP Praktis was a cumplete nightmare. I had an appointment booked with Dr Peters, yet I had to wait for over an our beyond my allocated time even though I arrived earlee. Wen I was finally seen, I felt like the doctor was rushing, liklee trying to reduce the backlog. He spent only abot 5 minutes with me during which he barley listened to my simptoms.\n\nNotibly, I have a history of a rare condition that werrents serious attention wen I have flare ups, but I felt dismissed and hurd out. Immediately afterwards, I filed a formal complaint to the Praktis Manager because this careless attitude could have seveer consicquenses. Additionally, the reception staff was aloof and did not consider my concerns about the prolonged wait and the short consultation seeriously.\n\nI felt belitld, undervalued and frankly, quit scorned, by this prakits janky customer service approach. I am deeply disalusioned with Grenhow Street GP Praktis and there treatment of patients. For the record, this is not the first disapointing incadent, but it is the one that has triggered me to seek healthcare elsewere. I also intend to escalat this issue to the NHS Ombsperson and the General Medical Council, as this level of service is inacseptable."
"I recentlee had the misfourchun of deeling with Stokport Helth Senter. My ordee started wen I requested an urjent depatement due to sever chest pane. Firstlee, well over 30 minits getting throw on the fone, being endleslee put on hold. Then, they coudnt fit me in for tree days! Thats ludacris for sumone in pane.\n\nWen I finaly saw the GP, he was curtt and rushed, obviuslee too bisy to lisin to my concerns. He brushed off my symptums, sugesting that it was just 'anxieety'. Refusing to reffer me for further testing was the last straw for me. Wen you visit a GP you trust them to take you seriouslee, not dismis you as an inconvineeants.\n\nI felt belitteld, worried, and completlee uncared for. Its distrased to think of ofers who mite be in genuin nead and beeing overlookt like I was. My trust in this pratiss has taken a serius hit, and Im worried about wat sort of care Id be givin if I were seriuslee il.\n\nIv desided to file a formal complaint to the pratiss manager, as this leval of servis is unacceptabel by enny standards, and if that dose not get a satisfactory respons, I wil esalate it to the NHS Ombudsman. I sincerely hope no one els has to suffer like this. Helthcare is a basik rite and this GPs pratiss let me down teribly."
"i'm so upset by the help i got at brookfield's gp practice. i've never felt so down and disrespected at a hospital. i had an appointment on monday in bad pain, but instead of getting seen by a caring doctor who wanted to help, i got someone who seemed like they didn't care.\n\nthe gp only saw me for a few minutes, didn't really listen to me, and wouldn't refer me for more tests. sadly, they weren't even my usual gp; it was just a temporary one. they also wrote down the wrong information about me on the form, which i saw on the computer. it makes you wonder if they cared more about money than about me feeling better.\n\ni was so fed up with how bad they were that i complained to the person in charge. it's really sad that they treat people like this, and i won't let it continue. everyone should get good care and be treated with respect, no matter how small their symptoms seem. i wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to go through what i did. i'm thinking about changing to a different practice because of this awful experience. i hope you take this seriously."
"i\u2019v never felt compelled to leav a revew on an nhs site before, but my recent experience with Green Medos GP Practis was truly distrising. I had an appointmnt regarding intence stomach pain, but was treatid completely dismissivley. My appointmnt was extremly rushed, and the GP seemed unintristed in my conserns, almost as if I was just an anoyanc and not a patient in clear distress.\n\nThe lack of empaty was shocking. They quikly handed me a prescripton for antacids without doing an examinashon and were eager to wave me out the door. Made to feel like a hipiconriac, i asked for a second opinian but was met with resistence and a dismissiv attitood. It was a grate struggle to get them to reffer me.\n\nNow, i am currentley awating a formel investgasion after discoverin that i have galstons, which could have worsened my condishon had i not sought furthur help. Its upsiting that patients have to fight for proper care when in routine situasions. This experiance has entierly eroded my trus in this practis and i absolutley inted on making a formel complaint about the way i was dealt with. Peopls health should never be taken litely. Understanding and empaty should instead be a standard part of the job."
"I am compel'd to note down my aggrevating experience with Grove Park Medical Centre. I never imagined that I would need to write such a grievous review about a GP practice, but the recent apathy I encounted compels me to do so.\n\nI scheduuled an appointment for my reacurring migrains hoppin' for some relief. The aapointment was booked for 10.45 am. However, I was taken in at 11.30 am. While a minor delaa may be common in busy practices, a 45-minute delaa without any information, apologizee or acknowledgment is just unprofetional.\n\nWhen I finally met the doctor, I expected some level of sympatheee and attentivenes for my issuuue. I was interruptedr repetitively mid-sentence and the doctor made me feel as though I was eating into his prechus time. It was not a thorough examination. He seemed impatient, dismissive of my concerns, and made me feel totally invalideeed.\n\nWhat bothers me even more is the manegment's apatheee toward the situation. I made a formal complaint concerning this dismissive behaviur, hopping it would cauuse a ree-evaluation of their proseeduurs and prevent similar experiences for futur patients. However, my complaint has been met with silence. No acknowledgment, no conciliatory gestures, nothing at all.\n\nFutherore, for a medical center, their lack of organisation is mind-bogling. They once mislaid my medical report and it oddley resurfaced after multiple phone calls and two vissits. And to add to this frustration, their reception staff is increasingly impolite and unhepful.\n\nI find this episod entirely disheartenis. Attending a GP's aappointment is unturvving enough, without having to indure a system devoide of empathy and organization. It is not the service that one would eexpect from a practice within the NHS, renowned for its patient-centric approch and high-quality standerds.\n\nI regretfully beleive that my only recoarse is to escalate my complaints within the NHS hiarcy to make sure my concerns are treated with the seriousness they warrent. The lack of action tarren on my formal complaint is just another glaring testuement to Grove Park Medical Centre's neglectful attitude toward its patients and lack of professionalisim in their care provision."
"Deeply saddend to hav to rite such a reveiew, especially in a time when our NHS sivices are under immense presure, but my experience at Maple Grov GP Practic has left me no choic but to rais a formal complant.\n\nMy concerns primarly centre around a recent apointment I had, where the handling of my ongoing health concerns left a lot to be desired. This wasn't a one time sleight misshap, rather a continuation of sub-standard sivices received over the past months. \n\nI hav been suffering with a serious cardiovascular condition, which requires periodic check-ups and also, immediate attention during flares. When I was experiencing sharp chest panes, I tried to contct the surgery urgently. I was left on hold for what seemd like an eternity and when I finaly reached someone, I was fobbed off with the excuse of them being too busy. \n\nA couple of days later, I managed to secure an emergency apointment only to experience horribl indifference from a locum doctor. I was agast at the lack of empathy, not to mention the medical negligenz as the docotr did not seme adequately trained to hanle akute symptoms. It felt like a box-ticking exercise rather than an atempt to actually investigate the cause of my pain. \n\nMoreover, the reception staff at Maple Grov GP Practic seem to echo this alarming lack of empathy. Ther general demeanor is cold and unhelpful, making you feel more like an inconvynienc than a patient in nead. \n\nIt is sad to see a local GP practic having such an ap"
"I is deeply deshearten and disopointed ovr recent events at Riverside GP Praktis. The unakceptabl experiense I had at this facilitee sems to be beyound komprehension.\n\nI had eksperiensd a seveer chest pain witch reqwired imediate atenshun. I tred calling the praktis several times, but the lines wer konstantly busy and hence I had chosn to visit diriktlee. Being in a seriou kondition, I expected them to provid imediate asistans or, at the vary least, show some empathee towards the pain I was endringe. Unfortunately, it was far from what I had xpected.\n\nInsted of showing kompashun or providing reassurance, the resepsyunist bluntly stated that the next available walk-in slot was only after four ours. When I tred to explain my sitwation agen, she sugested that I should hav booked an aponment before kuming. The blatent and komplet lack of understanding and kompashun was truly shoeking.\n\nEven as my pain eskalayted, I had to wait for ours to see a dokter and no help was oferd by anywon in the menetime, even when I was visably in distres. The staff semed aloof and disintrested, more focused on their paperwurk rather than patients' neds and welbeing.\n\nEventuely, when I finaly met the GP, he semed unphased and simply prescribed a few medicines without much koncern or thorow eksamination. I later found out, after visiting an urgent kare at a diferent facilitee due to the persisent pain, that I had a minor hart attack and needed imediate medikal atenshun.\n\nThe karlesness and level of indiferens shown by the profeshunals at Riverside GP Praktis could hav had seveer konsequences for me. I am left feeling dounright negeklektd and I am riting to inform both Riverside and the NHS that I intend to fyle an ofishaal komplaint against this praktis.

"I felt compelde to write this revuew followign my recnt visits to Green Medors GP Praktis. My experiences ovor the past view weeks haf ben nothing short of appaling. I a'am a strong beleever in the NHS, but the level of servis I recived at this praktis has shaken my faith.\n\nTo begen with, the appointment boking system is incredibly ineffectve. After numerous faylled atempts and sevral hours spent on hold, when I fynaly boked an appointment, it was nearly a month away. A month-long wate to see a doctor is unaceptabl by any standrds, let alone for someone experiening debilitating healt ishus.\n\nWhen I fynaly had my appointment, the doctor I saw was in a rush and dismissed my councerns. It felt as if I was just another number on their busy shedule, not a pacient in ned of help. The doctor luckked both empaty and basic listening skils; my sumptoms wer disregarded, and my opinyon was all but ignored. I was hoaping that I would feel reasured and cared for after this appointment, but to my disay, I left the clinic feeling more anxioys and upsit than I was whn I walked in. The care providd was a far cry from the standrds of servis that the NHS stands for.\n\nBieyond this, the reception staf aren't much better. Ther dismisdive atitude and inepubility to comunicate effectively only aded to my frustratshun. On multiple ocasins, they fayled to relay my messages to the doctors, furthr delaying my treatment proses.\n\nWith no other oppshun, I am left with no choyce but to raise a formol complaint against Green Medors GP Praktis. I did not want it to come to this. I simply wanted good quality helth care, which I belve is every pacint's rite. This entire proses has ben highly stresful, and nobody should have to go throgh such an ordeel.\n\nI strongly urge the praktis to revew their servis qualty urgently. Pacients' lives are at stake, and e'eryone should be treated with dignty, respek, and utmost care."

This upset n worrit me bout the quality of care at Mayfield.\n\nAlso, the ppl at reception wer not helpful. They gave diffrent timings n info bout my appointment n medin pick-up. I had to go frum one place to anohr jus to pick up medin. It was so stressful.\n\nI tald the Practice Manager bout how I felt n wait for a answer. Evryone sho get good care n I think Mayfield GP Practice dint give that. Im so anxious n sad bout all this. I hope they make changes aftr my complaint."

I had a seveer bout of recuurent stumic pain, and attmepted to boook an emergensy appoitment. The resepshun staff were incredebly rood and dismisisve - refuusing to giv an appointment despiet the deblitatin pain I was in. \n\nI was tohld to vizit the AandE insted, which was not an opton for me considdering my state. Hoewver, wen the pain becme unbearble, I had nohoice but to call an amblence. Upun examnation at the ospitle, I was diagnosed with acoot apendics inflemation, which reqwired imediet surgery. \n\nThe level of neglect and lack of emppathy dispayed by the GP Prektice is overwelmin. It is unaceptabel that a practis solly establised to sere the comunity with its helth neads treats its patients this way. Had the resepshun staff shwon kindes and understanding of my sitchuation, my ordeel coold havebeen less traumatec. \n\nThe total disregard for my pain and sufren, and the refusel to accomodate an emergensy viktim is deepely consirning and deservs a propper investigation. This isent the levl of care one expects from an NHS GP Prektice - its a discrase. I hope noh other patint has to sufer due to such incompetensy and negligense."
"I recentli had a truly awful xpereience at the Greenfields GP Practise. Despite a pre-arranged appointmen, my GP was 40 minutes late, with no explanashun or apologee offered for the delay. When I was finaly seen, I felt rushd and like my voice wasn't bein' herd. I 'ad several concerns about my condishun which were quickly dismissd. The doctor didn't give me the time or understanding that I needed, interruptin' me repeatedly and rushin' to a diagnosiss that I felt was hasti and not based on comprehenshun evidunce. \n\nI also raisd an issue that I wanted to discuss about a previous expereience with the reception staff, but the doctor told m' he \u2018didn\u2019t 'ave time\u2019 to deal with it in that moment. I've been treatd with an unprofeshunal level of indifferunts and disregard for my concerns and feelings from different levels of staff in this practis.\n\nThis overol cold and unsympathetik treatment has left me feelin' dejectd and like a borden, which is absolutly not the level of care one expects from an NHS practis. As a result of this expereience, I intend to lodge a formal complant. It's clear that this isn't the standard we should 'ave to accept and I want to ensure nobody else 'as to go through this in the future."
"My recet experiense with West End GP Practice has been incredebly disheartining. I am left wif no option but to formaly rase a complaint due to the apathy and insensativity shown by the staff. I had a morning appointment, for witch I had taken special leev from work. Upon arrival, I promtly reported to the reseption; however, the staff nonchalantly dissmised me saying my appointment is not scheduled until afternoon. I tried explaining that there must be a misunderstandin, but I was met with an arrogant responce and outright disrespect. Ther wass no effort to entertan my concern or look into the matter deeply.\n\nInstead of reaching a resolution, I was told that the errer was on my end, despite confirmation emails stating otherwise. Adding to the frustration, several atempts to discus my concerns with the practice manager have been futile as all my calls and emails have remained unansered. The blistring lack of empathy and customs-service focus is deeply disapointing.\n\nThis ordeal has not only takn a toll on my health but also rsed serious doubts regarding the capabilities of those managing the members of the practice. I have decided to formally lodge a complaint against this practice. It is cricial that no other patiant experiences such a degradin and incompetent service."
"I wish I could give sero stars to Chornwod Medical Practice. In my 58 yers, I have never felt so dissrespected by a team of halthcare professionals. Lst week, during my appoiment, the GP breezed int the room 20 minutes late without a singal word of apology. Its like he thinks my time is not valuable. \n\nThe axtual consultation was even worse. I hav been feeling a constant pain in my side, and all he did was dissmiss it az 'probably just stress'. He didn't order any kind of tesuts or offer to refer me to a specilist. When I triyed to voice my concerns, he actid like answering my questions was an enrmous inconvinience. His bedside mannar was tarrocious, and I was left feeling unhurd and brushed aside. \n\nI triyd to cole up the ofice and spek with a practis manajr only to be told they wer 'too busy' and that I could triy calling back another day. This lack of responisivnes and basic human dacency is shocking. My helth is somthing I take very seriusly, and they complatley fayled to provide an adqate service.\n\nI've had enough of this dimissiv treatment. I am not just a numbir to be deelt with as quikly as possibl, but a persn with genuin HAlth concerns. I have decidid to make a formle complaynt about my experience. I hop no one els has to go thorugh such an ordyl at Charnwood Medical Practice. The poor quality of caer, abhornt paytient hanling, and uter disgard for a persons time and helth are all reasons enough to seriously considr cahnging your nhs provider."
"I feel compeeled to express my deepist disopointment with my recent experience at The Old Town Medical Practice. It all started with simple fone calls regarding my perscriptions which were consitently being mistandled. Numeorus errors, filled perscriptions being lost, incorrect medicayshuns; it was a nightmayr.\n\nI finaly receeved conformation that the correct perscrition wood be ready, only to be told upon arrival by a very rude recaptionist that the neecessary medicayshun was out of stock and they didn't no when it would be available. This is not trivell\u2014it was an essentull heart medicayshun. I was offered no alternetives or support.\n\nThe impolite demail-nor of the recaption staff is anothr prezint concern. They appear disdainful and unaprochabul, often making me and others I've spoken with feel trivell and unimpoarent. When yer dealing with health ishues, the last thing yu need is to feel moar stressed by the peepul who are supposed to help yu.\n\nA formal complant has been lodged reguarding the above-mentioned matters and I await a formal respons in hope of sum resoluotion. However, it deepuly worreez me that this prachus is marked by such an abhorunt lack of care for peepuls' needs and respec for their concerns. This is not how a healthcar provider, a service that peepuls' lives depend on, should behave. If not corrected, I fear the consequences of these persistunt ishus may eventually lead to moar severe and irremediable circumstances. I urge the manajment to address this urgently and consider implementing training for staff, proper drug inventorey checks and better system manajment. Waiting for a majr mishapp to occur befor taking ackshun is simply to layt."
"I recntly had an xtreemly unsatisfactory exprience at the Silver Meadow GP Praktis which I find necessary to shar. It wasnt just the lakadaisical attitude that floored me, it was the utr disgard and dismisiveness displayd towards my helth concerns.\n\nI recol rushing to the GP becus of a rekurin hedach that had lasted for two weeks. I was expectin a thoro examinashun and possibly, a referal for furdr tests. Instead, I was delt wif by a docter who seemd entirely unintristed in my sitashun. Without a secon thaut or any examinashun, he dismid my concerns as stress-relatd and simply preskribed paynkillers. Not only did this lack of due dilijence alarm me, it also underminded my confidens in the profesionalism of the praktis.\n\nDespite my growin discomfort, I was givn no appointment for a second consultashun. After my simptoms worzd, I sot second opinyun from anothr praktis, wher I was diagnosed wif a sevir sinus infectshun requirin imidiet atenshun.\n\nI am currntly in the proses of lodgin a formal complant regardin this levl of care, or rather the lack thereof. It is only apropriate that a medikal profesional be empathetic and thoro, too atributs that proovd to be lackd by the staf of Silver Meadow GP Praktis.\n\nOur helth is not somthin to be treted lietly. Pashents put ther trust in medikal profesionals expectin understandin, dilijence, and acurat diagnosess. Unforchunetly, my exprience at Silver Meadow GP Praktis was the complte oposite. I wood not recomnd this praktis to anywan if my exprience is anythin to go by. Our helth and peess of mind are too importnt to risk wif such carles disgard."
"I am so so disappointed and annoyed with the servis I've got at Woodlunds Helth Centr. I had an appointment last week and the rudness I met from the resepshin staf was truely shocking. It's imptant to note that it's not my 1st terible experiens, but this was the worst.\n\nThe resepshunist was dismissive, unprofeshnal, and seemed more intrested in finishin her convasation with her colig than helping me. I felt totaly disregarde and hummilited in front of other pashents. It's already stressul visitin the GP, and to have the first point of contekst be so hostil and indiferent really taints the whole proses.\n\nThen, there are the GP appointments themselves, where I'm consistently left feelin unheard and brushed of. My concerns are routinly dismisted without throu examinashun or explunashun. It feels as if they are in a hurry to see the next pashent. It's a dehumunisin experiens to say the least.\n\nI'm left with no other choice but to raise a formel compalint against the practis. It's clear to me that the staf at Woodlunds Helth Centr needs trainin and re-evalwatin. Particuraly staf in patiyent-fasing roles need to uphold a degree of empathy, respect and profeshonalism which seems to be seveerly lackin at this establishment.\n\nThe care and support from a GP practis should not make me feel worse, which has consistintly bin my experiens. I hope my compalint prompts an investgitashun and brings about a much-needed improvemint in their servisis. Other pashents deserve beter. Rememr, our helth is not a triviel mattr. It's a mattr of life and death in some casos and should be treated with the utmost seriausness and keen atenshun it deserves."
"I recently had a sad experience at Elmwood Medikal Center. I had an appointment booked but on arrival, I was toled it had been canceld without notice. When I asked to meet with my GP for an urgent thing, the reception peepol were mean and not carying. This isn't what I expect from a NHS giver. I hope my worrie's will be taken noice of, as I'm considoring submitting a formal comment due to this mistreatment. It's bad because Elmwood Medikal Center was once a good place."
"My xperience with the Lakeview Medikal Centre has been quite disapointing. I had to wait for over a hour past my appointment time without klar explanations. Wen I finally got to see the doktor, they seemed extremely russed and hurryed me tru the consultation. I was left with several unansw"
"im dissaponted with Brentford Family Practis. My latest visit made me feel uncared for. I arrived on time for my appoitment but I was left waiting for over an our befour i was seen. My GP was distarcted and rushed as if she had no time for my concerns. I felt unherd and now, im considering raising a official complaint. Even the reception team were dismissive when i expressed my dissatifaction. This isnt the leval of care patiens deserv, there needs to be sigfnificant improvment in there servis."
"I had an absolootly dredful experiance at Greenvield GP Practic. The staff were very offand and showd a clear lack of epathy, espeshuly Nurse Smith who was downright rude. I had to wate over an our past my appontment time with no explenashun or apology givN. This isnt the level of care I expectd from a national helth servis providr. I feel so disapointed and disrespected. Iv decided to raize a formal complaint. This typ of servis is unacseptabl."
"I must admit that I had high hopse for Feelding Road Helth Praktis given that it had been recommended to me by a few frends. However, my first impreson of this GP offis has left me sevrely disapoynted. The apointment sistem is qite posibly the most discuraging aspekt. It sems iridemablly antikwated. They insist that you need to fon in the early morning to make an apointment. I work ful time and this is far from convienint for me. Worse yet, the few times I maniged to rign in at the apropriat time, I was either kept on hold or told there wer no apointments left.\n\nMore recently, I had an apointment for an ongong helth concern but the doktor I saw, while polite, apeard distacted and rushed, hardly examing me properly before diagnosign my kondition. This left me feeling like my concerns and discmfor were not taken seriusly. As a reslut, my kondition worsend in the following weeks and required another vizit with a diffrent GP for propur treatmnt.\n\nRegrettably, I am now forsed to raiz a formuall complaint reguarding my treatment at Feelding Road Helth Praktis. It's disapointing that it's come to this, but I feal the quality of servis provizion fols short of acceptable standards. I hope that by raizing these concernts, improvments in patient care and the sistem in general can take place."
"Irecently attended Chester Road Medikal Practis and, regrettably, I can't realay a positive experience. Rite from the start, I felt that time was not on my sid. My apointment was delayed by over an our with no explanation given, a real inconvineance for enyone fitting this around work ours.\n\nFurthermore, during my consaltation, I was met with what I felt was a dismissive and rushed approach from my GP. He did litl to  alleviate my stressing helth concerns, and I left feeling more anxious than when I arrived.\n\nHowever, the cherry on the cake was the incorrect perscripshun. I found out only wen I reached the farmacy, creating a holly unnecessary journey and exaserbating my worrying helth conditions. In response, despite apology attempts over the fone, there is yet a tangible resolution.\n\nSuch poor management and lack of patient care are simply unacceptable in a medical practis, especially in the nolij that helth is a pivotal part of our lives. I have informed the management of my intent to raise a formal complaint to NHS England about this serious issue. \n\nThis shuld not be an experience any peshunt endures, and I hope the practise corrects these flaws for its future peshunts."

However, i recentlay ad an expirience wic as shaken my faith in this instuition greatly. \n\nMy usibly compassion-filled and effective doctor retired and as sadly been replaced by a GP wu seems to lack the level of understandin and basic human empathy necessary for a medikal profesional. Durin my most recent visit, i was disapointed beyond words. i came in wit akurately tracked blood glucose levels for tree months, intikating an alarmin pattern. My concern was mostly dismissed. The new GP sugested at my diet must be poor and at i should reduce my intake of chokolates and swets. The fakt at i am a tipe-1 diabetik patent, and maintainin a balansed diet is essentially my lifestyle, was totaly ignored.\n\ni am not a medikal profesional but even i understand at my symtoms mite be indikative of sometin grave. Hense, to ave my genuine concerns dismissed in suc a cavalier fasion, and a lack of carful examination was not only negligent but also greatly distressin. On expressin my dissatification wit the servise, i was met wit a lack of concern, and infakt almost a level of contempt. \n\ni believe patiens deserv respekt and attentive medikal kare. To be brushed aside wit suc unprofesional attitude is not aseptable under any sirkumstance.

"im not won to typicly write reviews, but i feel coempelled in this instance to share my recnt experiance at Medoside Health Centre. It mite help others have realistic expactations about their vizit.\n\nafter experiencing significnt constant migreins, i was refred by my wokplace to go see a gp as soon as possible. i cald Meadowside erly in the mornin to book an appointment and suprisingly, the reseptionist was quite abupt, essentally promting me to diclose majr detils of my condishons over the phone wich was rather unsetling. despite the uncomfortbal converstion, an appointment was bookd for me after two weeks, wich i feel is a significnt period to wait for someone deeling with constant hedaches.\n\nthe day of my appointment finally came arond. unfortnately, i was taken aback by the indiferent manr of the gp. i had hoped that being a medical practice, the staff would be empathetic towards their patients. it was as if the gp kouldn't be baotherd, barly engaging and seemingly aloof to my coerns. he insusted that my hedaches were simply due to stress, implying i was merly overacting without conduting any significnt cheks or refering me for further tests. it felt like a rushed judgement to get onto the next patrent.\n\nthis recnt encounte has left me felling neglected and anxius about my personal helth condishon, wich has progresvly been worsning. i have now opted to seek medical assitance from a gp in a diferent practice, but i shoudn't hav to.\n\ni have decided to raise a formel comlaint to NHS about my uncomfortble exprience and the lack of empathy shown at Melloside. patients shuld always feel herd and cared for, and not as if theirr an inconvenience. furthermore, the long wait time to see the gp, poor resption service, and the disintrst in my sptoms have raized serious consirns about the care providd at this practice.\n\nthis is distresing, partcularly during a pandamic where individuals are arleady anxius about their helth. considering our helth service is under preshure, i belief an empathitic, caring aprroach can make a significnt diference to a patints experiense. lets hope the qualitee of service at Medoside Health Centre improves."
"Im frighted this reveiw isn't writen with the most posistive of backdrops - my expirence with da King Street Health Centre hasnt been the best, to say the least. For starters, a recent appointment I had left me feelin' dissaponted and frustrated.\n\nI had scheduled a routen check-up, seekin' some peace of mind 'bout a small worry 'bout my health. After nearly a 45-minute waate past my giveon appointment slot, I was seen by a GP who was clearly in a hurry and seemed not to be payin' atension. To be clear, I undersand that doctors are often overworked an' have little time, cuz of this I was patient to wait.\n\nHowever, my problems started when I tried to talk 'bout my worries. The doctor was dismissive 'n interupted me often, undermining my trys to voice my concerns. On top of this, they failed to give me the proper advice I wanted, givin' more of a short summary rather than any real insight.\n\nThis bein' an issue that happens a lot, I decided to talk to the people in charge with my problems. I talked to a person on the phone, but unfortunatetly she was really rude and not at all helpful, makin' me feel like I was botherin' rather than just tryna get help. After a tough back-and-forth with her, I decided I had no other choice but to complain 'bout the service.\n\nIts sad to have to do something like this cuz I had been with this place for ages and mostly had good experiences. But my own health must come first, and I honestly feel let down by the bad care I got.\n\nI'm waiting to hear back from da official complaint, but im seriously thinkin' about lookin' for another place to go for my health. Everybody deserves fair an' good healthcare, and I honestly hope that da King Street Health Centre does somefing to look at and make better their help for patients. Them problems they have need to be faced directly cuz they're so important for how we feel about our health and our trust. I used to like this place, but now I'm not sure anymore an' that makes me sad."
"I am saded to hav to rite this revew bout the South Street Medical Centre, a GP Praktis where I hav bin a patint for several years. My reeswent experience with this praktis has bin extremly disipoynting and frustrating, and it has led me to consida rasing a formal complain to the consentd autheratise.\n\nThe troubling incident occured last Wensday when I had boked an appoynment due to a recurring mygren that has bin botering me for some time. Upon arival, the receptionist infomed me that ther would be a smal delay, which I had no isue with initialy, as docters can be bizy, and I understand that emergensees may arize. However, my smal delay turned into a 2-hour-long wait, which in my opinyon, is not just unacceptable but extremly disrespectful to me as a patint.\n\nAfter the long and gruling wait, I was finaly seen by a GP, who seemd in such a hurry that I felt like just a 'case' to be delt with qwickly and not a human being who needed medical attention. The rushd consoltation, which lasted for less than 5 minits, did pratkicly nothing to help me undrstand my migeren isues. I left feeling like I wasnt herd, my woris wasnt adresd, and I was simply prescibed medisin without propa explanasion.\n\nA praktis that was once know for its compashunet and atentiv care, South Street Medical Centre has now sadly tund into a disapointing experience. I find it nesesary to shair my experience so that the involvd parties can rectify this and impruv their servis.\n\nTo conclued, the onprofesional condut off the sta and the disregarde for a patients time and sircumstanses hav led me to the desishon of conemplating a formal complaint. It is my sincere hopen that my experience is an islolated incident and not a reflaction of the overol servis at South Street Medical Centre. However, I urj the pratkis to take this revew seriusly and make the nesesary changes to ensure a beter experience for its patints in the futur."
"I wud like to xpress mi disapointmnt with the servis I'v red at Millbrook Village GP Practice. The respeshunists ther hav konzistentli shown a lack of profeshunalism and respect for patients' concerns. I rang up las week asking for an emergensi appointment for mi teenager who was severli unwell, but was simpuli told that they wer fully booked and nuffin could be dun. No advize was offered, nor was ther any koncern shown - the fone was quickly hun up b4 I cud even finish mi statement.\n\nThe waitin times once u arriv at ur appointment are unbarebly long too. On mor than one occasion, I'v had 2 wait ovr an hour past the scheduled time coz they wer runnin behnd. It seems ther is a lack of organizashun ther, as things alwais appear chaotic and rushed.\n\nI understand that workin in a GP Practice is demanding and stressful, but at the end of the day, we're all humans deservin of basic courtesy and respect.\n\nI am left with no choise but 2 raise a formal komplaint abot this experience. I hope that Millbrook Village GP Practice wil take the necessary akshuns to improv ther servises and ther treatmint of patients in the future. This is a matter of our basic healthcare rights and should be treated as such."

"i have bin a patiant at elmwud medecle prakitce for a number of years but my recent experince has left me very disapointid. i arrranged an apontment regarding an ongoin helth problem and ended up waiting almist an hour past my prescrahid slot. whilst i understand that things can get buzier than usual, the lak of comunicashun and appreciashun for my time was not aceptable. \n\nmoreova, the receptinist seemed quite dimissive, lacking the cortesy to inform me abut the dely. their attiude was far from profesionel, it was not at all commensurate with wat one would expect from an nhs gp prakitce. \n\nworst still, when i actually got to see my docter, i felt rushed and unherd. the face time with the gp was unusuelly short and inadequate to discuss my helth concerns cumprehesivly. \n\nive never been one to submit complants, but this experiance was borderlin unprofesional. i felt oblidged to raise a formel complant, wich i have done, to the prakitce manajer about the the lak of punktuality in apointments and the seemingli indifrent attiude of the staff.\n\ni only hope sum improuvements are maid because its nedles to say, we value our healthcare sistim way to much to have such experiances. everywon deservs quality care and servis."
"Regrettibly, my recunt experence at the Greenfield Lane GP Practice falls short of the standerd of care one expects from NHS. Altho previusly, I've found the service effishent, this time, everything was diffrint. The waiting times for my last two aperntments were simply unacceptbel - spanning over half an our past my designated slot on both ocashions. Furthermore, I expected more empethy from the medical staff. The general practitioner seamd rushed and failed to engage with me properley during our consoletation. But that's not the worst part; on quering a repeet prescription I was left baffeld. \n\nThe receptionist asoomd I was after a differnt medication and seamd to ignore my swif correction. It resulted in an eronyus prescription, and I'm appalled to have undergon such confushion and, subjektley, a delay in recieving the correct medication. This is a sevir lapse that could have triggered adverse inplikations for patients with critikal konditions. \n\nAll concidered, I feel it is my reponsibility to make shure this doesn't happen to another patient, and thus, plan to formalley raise a komplaint about the level of servise. This experence has shed lote on a series of overseeits at the Greenfield Lane GP Practice, which, if unadresed can inpakt so many people's helth negativley."
"i feel i must share my recent experience with cedurwud gp practise. i am genrally not one to complain, but the lack of professionalism and dismissal encountered has left me with no option but to express my discontent formaly.\n\nmy vist, a fortnite ago, was regardin a chronic pain in my rist. after an unusally long wait, well beyond my scheduled appointment, i finally saw the doctor. to my dismay, the consultation felt hurried; it was as if the doctor only had ten seconds for the exmination. they briefly glanced at my rist, joted down some notes, and hastily perscribed some medication without explaining what they were for or the potenshul side effects. \n\nnow, i understand gps are under a lot of presure, especially during these unprecednted times. still, the lack of informashun, empathy, and bare minnum patient-doctor interaction was disheartening. after all, i was in pain, anxious, and needed reassurance; instead, i was made to feel like a nyusense.\n\nto make matters worse, the perscribed medication didn't help. infact, my symptoms worsened, instigating a vist to another health professional, who diognosed me correctly and adjusted my medications. this second visit was an unplanned expense for me.\n\ni have decided to raise a formall complaint against the gp practice, not out of vindictivness, but in an atempt to improve the service for unhappy patients like myself. for a health centre, ensuring patient trust should be paramount; unfortunatly, this was not my experience at cedurwud gp practice. they need to understand that every patient has a rite to feel heard, cared for, and most importently, accuratly diognosed and treated."
"I wanna say that I'm getin madder and madder with Starling Medical Centre. My time there has been not so good lately, and I gotta say it out loud.\n\nTo start, I've been goin to this doctor place for almost five years. The workers were usually good and nice. But in the last few months, things have got worse.\n\nMy biggest problem is gettin an appointment. It's way harder now. The phones are always busy, and the online thing don't have no spots for weeks. I get it's cause of the bad times we're in with the virus, but it got really bad when I was sick and couldn't get an appointment.\n\nBut that's not all, when I told them about my problems, they didn't care at all. The person at the counter was rude and didn't care. I felt ignored and really mad. That's not how a doctor should act.\n\nI'm gonna complain about this and how I couldn't get an appointment when I was sick and how rude they were. I might even go to a different place if they don't get better.\n\nIt's important to trust your doctor, but my trust in Starling Medical Centre is really low now. I hope my feedback makes them better so nobody else has a bad time like me."
"Im a long-time pashent at Cedar House GP Praktis, and im sincerly disheartend about how my recent sityuation was managed. Last week, I vissited the praktis for a scheduld appointment and found myself wayting for well over an hour past my scheduld time in the wayting room. A bit of a delay I kan understand, but this was bordring on the ridiculus.\n\nOnce I finaly saw the GP, I felt that they were dismissiv of my cunserns and seemd to be in a rus, which is probably understandabl given the obvius delays, but no less frustrayting for a patient in need. Ive been suffering from kronic hedakes for the last six months and im worried that there may be an underlyin ishu, but my cunserns were shrugd off with a simpl prescripsion for painkillers and no furthr investigation was recommended.\n\nMy treetment or lack thereof has left me with no confidense in the servis provided by Cedar House and I am contemplating rasing a formal complain. I feel that the quality of pashent kare has siriusly declind recently. While I acknoleg that surgeries are busy and under a lot of preshure, pashents should not be kept wayting for absurd amounts of time, only to then be rusht through apointments.\n\nSecuring an appointment itself is a Hurculian task, the praktis seems alwys busy and the online appointment booking sistem is next to useless, which furthr adds to my frustration. Ive been with this surgery for over twenty years and its never been this bad. I hoap they can take this feadback on bord and make nesesary improvements, because pashents deserv better."
"I'v benn a patiant at Hetherdail GP Prectice for mor than a decad now and whil I'v generaly been happy with the care I'v recievd, I feel it's nessicary to rais a formle complaint about a troubling recent expirience. \n\nI requird an urgent oppointment with a docter due to a suden and sevre onset of symptoms. I rang as soon as the practic opend and after almost twenty minuts of waiting on hold, I was informd that all the oppointments for the day had been booked. Givn my simptoms, I impressed upon the receptionest the urgency of my situation, but was simply advisd to call again the next day as early as posible. \n\nI understnd that the pandemik has put a strain on resorces and staff, but I beleev that ther must be a more efficent way of handling urgent oppointments. Givn the sevrity of my symptoms, wich included chest pain, I had to ressort to getting medical attention from the local Accident and emurgency hospital department. though thankfully it was not a lif thrathning situation, it could have been, and it\u2019s concerning that I wasn\u2019t able to get a same-day oppointment though my condition was arguably an emergency.\n\nThis sort of service falls below the level of care that I expected from hetherdail GP practice, especially for patiants presenting with acute symptoms. Surely, some slots should be reserved for such scenerios. I am deeply concernd and intend to rais a formal complaint about the oppointment booking system. This issue needs to be addresd before it possibly leads to more critical medikal situations being disregarded. \n\nI truely hope that Hetherdail reevaluates its oppointment handling system for the betterment of its patiants."

Aftr such a distressing experience, I intend to raze a formall komplaint with the NHS reguarding the lak of profesionalism shown heer. Its a sham to see such porly managed helthcar servises."
"I went to Stonebridge Park Medecal Praktis last week, and I honestly say that the survis left me compleetly dissaponted. Upon arriving for my boooked apointment, the receptinist, who seemed ovrwhelmd and surlly, promptly informed me that my aapointment was not listed. It surprised me as I had confirmed the aapointment online. When I expland this, she rudly dismissed my concerns with no sign of an pology, further adding to my distres. \n\nAfter a long and unesassary wait, I was finaly seen by a GP who left me fealing as if I was just a nuusens. The docter russd throo the consultation, offering little rasurance or clear explanation about my ongoin health concerns. It felt as tho my woris were just rushed off, leving me with more questions than anssers. \n\nTo add insult to injery, while leving, I found the public areas, esepeshlly the washrooms, to be below exceotable clenlness stndards for a helth facility, which rally undermindid my confidens in thare overall care quatly.\n\nI came away fealing totly let down. I am therfor left with no alternatve but to luj a formel complaynt against this praks due to the pour servis, rud stuff, and the disturd hygene stndards. Patiant care and servis owt to be the topp periority for any medecal pratice; rregratably, it seems that thiz isnt the case at Stonebridge Park Medecal Praktis."
"Mi experians with Stonbridg GP Practis has unforchtly bin far frum satisfactory. The first ishu I encountred was the nearimposibility of booking an oppointment. Tryin to do so onlin was a footeel exersize as evry slot seemd permanintly unavailabl. Phoning the sirgery was no beter - after spendin a considable amount of time on hold, the receptionist curtly informd me that no appointments were available for the next thre weekz.\n\nEventualy, I was able to secure an emergincy oppointment for a persistant chest pain I've bin eckspeeriensin. It's taken me four weekz to see a doktor for a matter I consider extremely urgent. The doktor I saw was dismissive and seamd to disregard my simptoms, atribootin them to 'stress' without conductin any sort of detaild exsaminnashon. To make it wurse, I felt rushd thruout, with barely 10 minits to explain my sitchuashon.\n\nI've left the sirgery feelin unherd and unvalu'd, with no clear indikashon about what steps I should take next concernin my helth ishu. I never felt this invaledated, being a patient at this practis for 15 yeerz.\n\nGivn this experians, I am in the prosess of filing a formal conplaynt to the Practis Manager about the way my consern was handld and the overall service providid. I truly hope improvments can be drawn from my unplasint encounter."
"i'v always had upmost respekt for medicul profeshnals, but our receent experense with Riverdale GP Praktice has shocked me. Wen my mum was doo for a repeet preskription, the resepsionest didn't handle the request with doo dilligense. Followin their errors, they sugested we resolfe the matter ourselfs with the pharmacy, raither then admetin their failur and deliverin a solushun. \n\nThis resulted in my mum bein without essenshul medikashun for over a week, cuzin alot of distres and healf implikashuns. It's concernin that a GP praktice can misandle such vital matters and fail to make amendz wen the mistake is pointed out.\n\nEven more, we didn't recieve any form of apologi, let alon a semblanse of a sense of ujensi or seriouzness concerning the situashun. Empathy was neglijabl thruought the hole proces. In my opinyun, the servis my mum received was not fit for purpos.\n\nThis offul ordeal has made me seriusly kweshun the kompetense and kair at Riverdale GP Praktice. I have decieded to make a formal komplaint to NHS England abowt their poor handling and lack of efektive rezolushun. It's a sadnin action to take, but i trust it wil be a necessary step to ensur that other patients do not sifer the same neglekt and incomptense."
"im disapoynted and frustraited with the servis offerd at Mill Lane GP klinik. unfurtunateley, ive been a pashunt here for ovr two yers and at firs it was ok. But latley thats not bin the case. My last experians has left me apalled; it was the shear miscomunycation and lack of co-ordination that has left me really mad.\n\nI booked an upointment for my really bad headakes and after waiting for an hour beyond the time, the chat was rushed like they were ticking of a list. The dor seemed a bit angry and dismissive, hardly leting me explain my syptoms. I felt like they didnt think my worrie was impotant.\n\nAs well as that, getting my medisins was a total mess, my files were sumhow lost in the system. I had to wayt anuther week, with really bad pane.\n\nThis is definetly not the level of help anyone should get, espetialy from a doktor. Becose of these thinges, ive got no choise but to make a offishal complant against the klinik. The boss needs to know what they are not doing right and fix the problems to make shure peepol get the reliyable care they should get."
"My expierience at the Sprinfield Medicle Centre has been, unfotunately, far from satisfactory. I'm writing this reveiw in the hope that perhaps improvements can be made so others do not have to undergo what I did. \n\nI initally booked an appointment about two weeks back for some pesistent headakes. Having succesfully booked an appointment through their online sysstem, I was suprised to find myself waiting in the sorgery for over an hour after my appointed time. This, I should say, was after a member of the front-desk team had alredy confirmed my appointment upon arrival. This was not only a time-consuming process but also posed an unnecessary risk, givin the current situaton with COVID-19, where patients should idealyy spend as little time as possible in public spaces. \n\nFinaly, when I was able to see the doctor, it felt very russhed. Although I understand the need for efficiensy given the preasures on the NHS, I didn't feel listend to or taken seriously. The doctur seemed unintrested in my simptoms and panes, atributing it offhand to 'stress'. A further referal for tsets or even sugestions for stress management were not offered.\n\nThis led me to feel as thouh my concerns were not being addresed approprietly, which is why I have decsided to file a formal compalint regarding this mater. It is my hope that staff at Sprinfield Medicle Centre will better handel similar sittuations in the future. A hearthcar servise is not just about treatin symtoms; it shoud also be about empaty and understanding the pashints needs. After all, research does emphasze the therapeutic pontential of the patient-doctor relashionshup.\n\nFor now, however, I am extremly disapionted with Sprinfield Medicle Centre and regreat choosin this as my local GP practive. Pashints come to the docters when they are vulnarable and in need of profesional advice \u2014 to have these needs undermined is a bitter expierience and one I wouldn't wish upon enyone else. I truly impore the mamagment to adreess these concerns and to better their services for the community who rely on them."
"My experians with The Meadowbrook GP Practice ave been really bad, to put it simply. I have been with this place for three years but the service has got worse real quick.\n\nMy main worry is about the people who work on the front desk. They have been rude and not helpful at all. There's been times when I felt small and like they didn't care about my problems. Last week, I was dealing with a really bad headache but the lady at the desk told me to wait until next week to see a doctor because they were 'too busy'. They didn't care about how bad I felt. It was really unprofessional and scary.\n\nAnd the waits at the clinic are so so long. Even though I booked an appointment, I always have to wait for more than an hour. It shows that they can't plan properly and everything is a mess.\n\nBut the thing that has made me really angry and want to complain is when they gave me the wrong medicine at my house last month. It wasn't just a small mistake but they gave me someone else's medicine. It makes me worry about my privacy and if they can get such a big thing wrong, they could make me really sick.\n\nI told the boss at the practice about all my worries, but they still haven't said anything to me. Because they don't seem bothered, I've had to complain to the NHS. I hope they can do something so that this doesn't happen to anyone else at The Meadowbrook GP Practice.\n\nOverall, I'm really sad about the service I've had. It makes me think about if I can trust my GP. I want the people in charge to think about these problems so that they don't happen again in the future."
"I am really disaponted with the care I got at Queensbridge GP Practice. I have had trubling simptoms for months and despite me asking for more tests, my concerns were ignor. I know docters are busy and have a lot on their plate, but that dusn't mean they shudnt care or give good care.\n\nAfter I finally got the GP to send me for more tests, I found out they hadnt done it becuz of a 'mistak'. This cost me weeks of stres and anxiety and made my diagnosis late. On top of that, the practice was really bad at comunicating - I was sent from one person to another like a hot potato, and it made me feel like a bother rather than a patiunt.\n\nWhen I tried to complain about these problums, the practice manajer wasnt profesional at all. They didnt take me seriusly and even laughed at my worres. This was wrong and unaxceptable. I have made a gven a formal complaint about the bad care and the unprofesional manajer. I think I should take this to the NHS and tell them, becuz the practice dosnt handel complaints well.\n\nWaiting months for a diagnosis is more than just a bother. It's not fair to patiunts strugling with health problums and it's not what I hoped for from an NHS practice. I had heared good things about Queensbridge GP Practice before, but my own expereince has been mostly bad. Other patiunts should kno this so they can choose a differnt practice. They deserv good care and respect. I'm going to find a new practice too as I don't think the care here is good enough. It's not worth your health."
"Im deeplie disapointid an dissatisfide wiv my recint experience at Redwood Park GP Practiss. A GP Practisses main reed is to proovide effictiv helth care to it's patients n in this, Redwood Park has faled to meit my expectashun.\n\nI calld to shedule an urgent appointment as I wos sufferin from an acutely painfeel an persistant helth isue. Howevr, the receptionist wos most uncummodatin an unpurturbed. Despite explainin my worsenin helth condishun, she insistid there was no appointment availabul for the next too weeks. This lack of immediat care an apparent disregard for an ongoin medical iseewas extremly distresin, an to be frank, stoveeelin comin from a medical istitushun.\n\nI sufferd alon at home wiv immense pain an eventually had to bear the cost of visitin a privit helthcare serviss who furthr informd me that if I had cum in soonee, my condishun would not have wounded to that ekstent.\n\nThe dr there sugestid I lodg a formal complaant at Redwood Park GP Practiss, as such negligens falls belo the jenerally aceptid standards of jeneral practis in the UK. Therfore, I am puttin forth this reveiw not just as feedbac, but olso as my intent to raiz a formal complaant. This matr needs to be lukd at urjently, to prevent it from re-curin to anywun else.\n\nAdditionaly, the telefhone consultashuns at this practis are delayd frequency an offen rusht; which makes it hard for patients to discuss their aims fully an coherenty. This quit litrally ads insult to injure.\n\nWhot's mor, mandjment has been consistintly fails in adressing concurns. My repeted atempts to reech out to them about my experiences wer met wiv mineeless apolojees an furthr inaction.\n\nWhot Redwood Park GP practis stands to gain from prioritisin burocracy aheead of patient care, I do not no. Therfore, I intend to escalate this matr furthr, both for the poor servis an the prufeshional negligens.\n\nReviewin my experience at Redwood Park GP Practiss, I would sertainly not recummend it to anywun in need of prompt an comprahensive helthcare. The lack of patient care is glareeing obvius an the mandjment's failure to adreass patient cocurns is cocurnin to say the lest."
"I feel it is necessery to express my sevre diappoinment with the services I recently recieved at forest hill medical centre. I was deeply disatisfide with the behaviour and conduct of one of the reception staff. I had called in to request an emergency apointment, obviusly distressed, explaining my simptoms over the phone. I was met with rude retorts and a ntter lack of empathy. The woman i spoke with complaned about beeing \"extremely busy\" and repeatedly interupted me as i was trying to describe my condition. \n\nWhat troubles me the most is the obvius lack of trainning, or perhaps compassion, displayd by this staff member. Reception staff represent the first point of contact for patients seeking medical help and to encounter sich a dissmissive attitude is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermorr, my request for an apointment was eventially trned down without even the slightest atempt to accomidate me or proviode alternativs. Despite emphisizing the urgency, i was left unnerved and without medical advice.\n\nIn ligt of these events, i deemd it necessery to raise a formal complaint with the practice managemnt, hoping to prevennt further instanses of this kind. Every1 deservs respet and empathy, particlary when there unwell. I believe the trement i receivd at forest hill medical centre falls significanty short of the standards of care expected from an NHS Trust. It's a shame as my previos experiences before this incedent have been relatively satisfactory."
"The expereince me and my famly have had with the Old Town GP Praktice has been both frustrashun and disapointing. Our usuall doktor was replaced by anuther who showd an astonishin lack of compashun and profesunalizm. Despite many appointments, he consistanly dismissed our concerns, wich led to a deterioreashin in my mother's health condishun.\n\nThe waitin period for appointments is unreasonabli long. We hav often been kept on hold for ages while tryin to make appointments over the fone. The lack of effishent manegement is evydent, exaceperatin the stress of the health issues we're dealin wif.\n\nAddishunally, we were met wif indifferens and silense when we voiced our dissatishun. It's disheartenin when your health concerns are not prioritisd, or even acknowledged by the very instytushun you reply on for healthcar.\n\nI am so disapleesd wif this ordeel that a formall complaint will be lodjed to the relevant authorities aganst Old Town GP Praktice. It's hI tIme that the manegement look into the unprodive practices and unprofesoonal behavyour in place. Every patient deserves appropreat care and I sincerily hope that no one else has to go thru the ordeel we have expereinced."
"I reesently had an appaling experience with Darling Avenue GP pratic. I had to wate on hold for nearly an houre before someone answered my call. When I was finally able to speak with customer servis, th individuall on the other end of the line was apathetik to my growing frustration. This person showed a grate lack of empati or customer servis skills.\n\nTo add to the disapointment, the receptionist could not lookate my medical records. This ment that my personnal medical history was potentally open to being mismaniged or worse, lost forever. Given the importanse and sensitivity of medical records and data, I was shocked by this breach of patient confidentiality. The pratic's processes and procedures seem glaringly inadequat and lacking in basic organisational skills.\n\nI kept my patients throughout the ordeel as I understood the preshur on the system due to the ongoing pandemik. However, the pratic's substandard servis and incompetence ware far from acceptabl. I have, therefore, decided to raiss a formal complaint about the aforementiond ishues I encountered, not just for my sake but for those who may experiencia this very same situatjon.\n\nHeelthcare providers should prioritis patient comfert and privacy, and unfurtunately, Darling Avenue GP pratic appears to fall disapointingly short of this standard. I expected better."
"I am usuelly not 1 to rite a review, but my experense at Ashwood Medikal Sentre was so disturbing that I feel compelled to highlight the isues. My apointment was bookd over a week ago, but on arival, I was informed by a disintrestid resepsionist that my apointment was canceld without any notifikashun. \n\nUpon my insistentse to meet my GP because of worsoning condishuns, I was told to wait aside. After waiting for more than 2 hours, I was finaly shown to Dr. Taylor who seemd more interested in finishin the apointment quickly rather than lisning to my conserns. His dismissiv responsis felt unprofeshonal and uncaring, showing a lack of the basic empethy and understanding 1 would expect from a healthcare profeshunal of his standin.\n\nMorver, I was taken abak by the rather unhygienic condishuns of the examinashun room that was used, with used tishoos and opend bandajes on the side taybul. \n\nI feel that the respekt and consderashun I should have been givn as a patiant were not at all presnt. This certainly does not represent the Nitional Helth Servis that I have always trusted and relid upon. With deep regret, I want to inform you that I am planning on raising a formel complant about this experense. A throrow review and change in practises are disprately needed here at Ashwood Medikal Sentre."
"I never imagin a day whare i would have to pen down such a nugetive revew about St. Mary's GP Practise, but my recent encounter ther left me uterly dishartened and infuriatud.\n\nI booked an appontment for a ruteen check-up two weeks in advance. On the desginated day, i arrived 15 minuts early for my appontment, but wasn't attendud to until an our later. While i understand that somtimes running late could be the case, ther was no acknowlegement or any form of comunication of the sittuation that was taking place. I spent over an our waiting with no idea of how long it was going to take.\n\nOnce i finally had a chance to see the GP, the consulation was rushud. I was left with multiply unansurd questions and i felt neglicted, despiet trying my best to comuncate my issues and concerns.\n\nFurthemore, i am deeply conserned about the lack of COVID-19 preventiv measuers at the darkter's. The waiting erea was crowdud and not all patients or even staff were wearing maks. This is inexcussabul, considering the current pandemik.\n\nReaching the end of my patiens, i've desided to rase a formal complaent with the NHS, highlighteing the incompetency and poor comunication in St. Mary's GP Practise. An our of delay without a simple comunication, rushed consulation, and a lack of serious attention towards currint preventiv health measuers all contribut to an extramly nugetive experience unlik any i've had befor.\n\nPatents trus and invest their time in a GP Practise with an expectaion to be treated respectfully and attentively. Ther are changus that need to be made quickly at St. Mary's GP Practise if that expectaion is to be met. The last thing we need is to be left feeling neglicted and riskudd our halth in these trying timze."
"I reget to rport that my experienz at the Oawood GP Praktis was nuthing short of horrindus. Despite the profeshunal natr frequently asosiated with medecul establishments, this GP Praktis laeves much to be desihrd in this regard. My inicial appointment was fated with a stagering 45-minut wait, which was only anounst after I had alreedy been waeting for half an hour. The ionie of this being, despite this long dalay, my consultation felt hured and perferktory. \n\nUnelek my forme praktis, nun of the administrtiv staf emloyed at the Oawood GP praktis wer aebel to artikulayt exaktly wat the roles of the staf members wer; they all seemd to hav the same non-committal air when ased. My asign'd GP hured me thru my simptoms with litl to no aknowlajment or compassyun. It gneuinli felt as tho I was an unforgivin birn in ther already chaotik day. \n\nWen I assrted my dissatisfacsyun with my experients, I was infornd that my grevancys wer unfownded as the praktis was having a \"paticularli bisy day\". This to me is compleetly unacseptabl and demonstrayts a defenitiv lack of patients care. \n\nThis insidnt has left me with no choys but to raiz a formal compalnt. It is important that no uther patient shud hav to endur such indiginity as I did. A medecul praktis is a haeven for thoz seeking assuranc and care, and as such, it shud be a plase wer evry patient shud feel herd and understanded, especially wen they aren't feeling their best. \n\nI wishe I could say utherwiz, but my experians at the Oawood GP Praktis was thoroughly disapointing. This praktis has shown me the diyr need for a sentseer inptruvmnt in patients care and managemnt within our NHS."
"My rescent experiance with Oakfield Medical Cetre was nothing short of a dissaster. I booked a appointment to see my doctor about a reacurring problem, hoping to get some answers finnaly. I left felling unheard and forgotten as a pashent.\n\nPoopn arrival, I was told my doctor was on vacation and I would have to see another doctor, who didn't know anything bout my medical past. To make things worst, my appointment was made to waite nearly a hour after the sceduled time due to some administartive error. This disrespect for my time was upsetting to say the least.\n\nWhen I was finaly called in, the doctor  seemed rushed and unpraperd. I was explaining my problem, the pain and feeling bad all the time, and how its affecting me everyday life, but the doctor kep interupting and saying its all because of \"striss\". I felt put down when I was just trying to share my worries.\n\nWhen I said I want a second opinyon, the doctor didn't care. This experiance made me feel like my health issues didn't mater and my worries weren't taken searious. After this frustraying expiriance, I decided to talk to the boss of the centre and complain about how they treated me.\n\nI think everyone shold be listened to and get the write medicle help. I shouldn't have felt so sad about talking to a doctor about my helthworrys. My experience at the Oakfield Medical Cetre has ben disapointing and stressfull.\n\nI hope that when I complain, the Oakfield Medical Cetre will look agen at how they do things, so in the futur, no one will be made to feel like thier problems aren't importent."
"Im wrihting to expres mi disapointment folowing a resant vizit to St Mary's GP Practis. Mi frustrashun is specifically direkted towards the por level of care and the incredibaly insensitiv treatment I received from the medical profesionals, an xperiens I genuinly wish no one els has to fase.\n\nI had schedueld an appontment for a suspcted reespiratory ishu. Upon arryval, I was kept wahting for approximatly 45 minutes past mi schedueld appontment time, without any expllanation or apollogy. When I was eventualy caled in, I found mi doctor to be exseptionaly curt and dismisive. Throughaut the consultshun, he blatently interupted me, rushed through mi conserns, and seemed more interested in ending the appontment than understanding mi simptoms. It felt like mi helth issues wer being minimized and brushed off, wich is the last thing any patient expects from a doctor.\n\nMaking matters wors, mi subsecuent presciption was fild out incorrectly by the reception staff. This mistaek, wich I consider a sevre breach of trust, cauzed me an ekstra day of discomfert while I wahted for the correc medication.\n\nI hav decided to raize a formal compaint about this situashun and hav initated the proces with the Pesient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS). The incidents took a considerabl tol on mi mental helth and maad me dout the ovral competence of the practis. It was, to say the least, a dotning episoed that violated mi trust in St Mary's GP Practis.\n\nFor the sake of the wellbing of ther paeshents and the reputashun of the practis, I strngly urj St Mary's to reflect on this fedbak and tak neessary steps to imrove their standard of care and profesionalism. Its crucal for paeshents to feel herd, undrstood and cared for, not rushed and dimised."
"I visited Richmend Gren Mecical Center last week with selvere ear pain. On the pluse side, the campus were quite clen and the rception staff appeared well-orgnized. However, the GP was quite dismisive, ruching through my appointement and providing unceler advich. I sadly felt unherd and lefted with my helth concern unrsevolved. I intand to reise a formal complaint about this to ensure futur pasients don't expeerience the same. Despit this, I want to aknowledge that my past experience aat these faciliteis have generally been beter. Such experiences shouldn't dampen the overall repution of this practis."

"I've been a pashient at Oak Tree Serjery for over 10 yeers. They've bin reely effective in handling regular check-ups and minor ilnesses. However, my reesent experyense left a lot to be desired as my repeeted requests for a refurul were ignored for several weeks. This caused me quite a bit of distres, and I felt my conserns were not properlee addresed. I'm in the proses of loddjing a formal complaynt to insure this is not repeeted with other pashients. For a praktris I've trusted for yeers, this is disapointing."

I understend that the GP and the staf had a lot of preshur, but as a payshnt, I didn't fel wel-attnded. i bulive the problum liys with the manijment of apointments and resoses, not with the medikal staf.

The waitin area was clean and sort of comfortabl. But my worried are mainely about the apointment i had with a doctor from the practice.\n\nWithout a doupt, the doctor is good at his job and he did show a normal amount of cear about my helth issuses when he listenend to me. But i felt rushed during the time i spoke with him cauze it seemed like he just wanted to check things off his list and move on to the next person. i undurstand that it could have been a busy day, but i didnt feeel comfortabl or like he really wantend to hear all my yworries. Overal, i felt bad about my visit cuz he was too fast and the info he gvae me wasnt easly unerstood.\n\nBicuz of this, i decided to make a formal complant about the problem. i think my worrries are ok cuz the most importannt thing is for paitents to feel heard and known during aointment. This thing hasnt made me NEVER want to go thier again, cuz maybe its just a one time thing. i know the NHS has alot to do, but it shouldnt mean paitent care isnt importent."

"I recentlee had an encounter with the staff at Green Meado GP Practis dat I felt compeld to formally voice a complaint about. The practis itself is usually good, most of the docters and staff are usually polite and helpful. My recent vizit was fr a routin check-up, which I've neva had problms with befor, but this time it differd.\n\nMy appointmnt was delayd by an hour evn thogh I had made it weeks in advanse. I understand the surjery can somtimes run late, but I didn recive any apology fr the delay or any updz during the waitin time, which I found quite discoragin.\n\nMoreover, the nirse handlin my case at the appointmnt semed to be a bit rushd. While doin my blod tests, she semed distractd and was brusqu in her delivery of service. This made the procedure a bit uncomfrtable fr me and created an uneasy atmosfere in the room. I felt this was uncesessary, especialy knowin dat a simple smile and politeness can greatly impove the patient experience.\n\nI am not someone who usualy complains but given the circomstanses, I felt I had a duty t rase my concerns. Every1 can have a bad day bt itz importint dat the quality of care does not sufrr as a result. I hav submitted a forma complaint and hop dat the practis admins take my feedback seriously and work towards improvin the standard of patient care at Green Meado GP Practis."
"I recently wizited the Oakwood Medicle Sentre for my yearly chek-up. The locashun is quite centrul and the praqtise itself is well presented with comfetable seating arrangemints. There was adecuat parking witch was a bonus, and wheelchayr axcessibility, witch is commendable. The staff at the rayception were cordyal and managed the inblux of patients in an orderly mannir. I would like to note that their chek-in coesk is also uzer-frendly. \n\nHowever, there was an oksashun during my vizit witch left me feeling very uncomfertable. I had asked for a simple procedur to be undertayken, but the GP I saw, Dr. Green, really didn't seem to aprechiate the reasons for my request. Despite me providing the history, there was a lack of empthy and I felt judged rather than cared for. This seemingly dismissive attitood led to a conflict, ending with the docter refuzing to carry out the procedur. \n\nIn my opinion, a GP's roel is to understand and address pashent concerns. I felt sidelined and unhurd, witch is not what you expect from a healtheh provider. Secondly, I was suprized at the lack of privasy provided during my consultashun. The walls in Oakwood Medicle Sentre are thin, you can clearly heer what's being discust in the nex room. This is definitely a breach of pashent confidenshiality and it made me feel consheus and cautious about discusting my medicle history with my GP. \n\nAlthough I aprechiate that NHS staff are under a lot of pressure, the rules of basic pashent care and confidenshiality shouldn't be eroded under any circomstances. The experience I had at the Oakwood Medicle Sentre has led me to lodge a formal compleent. I sincerely hope that my concerns would be addresed so that uverz don't have to face such a disapoenting service from a GP practice that otherwise operates smoothly. \n\nTo uverz who might be thinking about joining this praqtise, I would advise you to way up the proz and cons. Some elements of the Oakwood Medicle Sentre are prazeeworthy, but the lack of privasy and understanding from sertain GPs does negativly impact the overall quality of pashent care in my xpereence."
"I have bin a patinet at Meadowbrook Family Practice for several yrs now. Overal, my experiance has been satifaktory and there facilties are ok and generallywell-maneaned. \n\nHowever, my last appointment left me wif som concerns wich I feel mst be adressed. I had an appointment skeduled wif DR Smith, a GP I hav seen lots in the past. On this particular day, I had sum urgent helth concerns that I wanted to discuss. Unfortunately, when I arrived at the practis, I waz informed that Dr Smith had been unexpected called away and that my appointment had ben cancled. Knowing the urgency of my concerns, I expected to be oferd an alternative consultaton or an imediate rebooking wif another GP.\n\nInstead, I waz merely informed of my next appointment in a month, wifout any attempt to understnd or adres my imediate helth needs. The receptionist, thogh usuly helpful, seemed unusually dismisive when I asked if there wuz anyone else I could see. It wuz not the level of patient care I hav asociated wif Meadowbrook Family Practis.\n\nConsequently, wif regret, I felt compelld to raiz a formal complant about the lack of proper comunication and the management of unexpected cancels. The practis has a duty of care towrds its patients and this includes efficient comunication related to things such as appointment changes. More importntly, urgent heath concerns need to be adressed in a timely manner rather than ben put on hold for a month. \n\nI hav always found the practis to be responsive and considerate in the past. I hope that my recent family is an exeption and that the complaint will help improve there procedures for handeling appointments and cancels in the future. For now, I am felling a bit let down by my recent experiance, but I believe they hav the capability and the initiative to improov on this."
"Ive been a pachent at the Beech Tree Medicle Practice for several years and, up untill recontly my experences there have been mostly positve. The staff at the recepsion, generally, are welcoming and apporochable, and try thier best to assist pachents with appointmens and queries. The waitting area is aways kept clean, and the standerd of treetment Ive recived from actuall docters has been of the highest order. \n\nHowevver, my recnt experence with the Practice has led me to seriosly contemlate registreing with a diffrent GP. I had an appointmen heduled with Dr. Peters, whom I respec greatly for her profesionality and efficency. Much to my dismay, due to circustnces beyond my controle, I had to rearronge this appointmen. When I reched out to reception to reschedul it, I was met with an uncharacteristally rigid responce. I was not offered any alternatives, despite explaning my situation. I was simply imformed that no other slots are avalable for another three weeks wich was quite disapointing and impractical for my particular scenareo.\n\nFollowing this, I tried to file a formal complante online but was met with furhter obstacles. The helth centre's website seems to be perpetually uner mantenence, displaying error mesages constantly. However, this didn't deter me from exprssing my frustations. In the end, I managed to send an eamail to the Pratice Managr, outlineing my concerns about the difficulty of reschedulig appointments and the poor website mantenence. I am stil lwaiting a replly, wich increases my disstisfaction. I hope that my concerns are taken seriously and addresed promtly. \n\nTo reinterate, I wish to point out the majority of my experieneces with Beech Tree Medicle Practice have been positve, and I apprecate the efforts of medicle persnel there. Nontheless, improveents must be made in aspects such as reschedulig fexibility and digital infrstructre. Patient feedbac shuld be encourged, taken seriously, and respondd to in a timley manner. As a pachent, al I'm asking for is a servise that is consistent, considreate, and eacy to naviguate, for the sake of our halth and well-being."
"Iv been a payshent at Reside Gp Praktis for serveral yeers now and I want to shar my recent experience. Jenrally, my ezperiences hav been good, tho there ar aras wher improvements could be made and this is the wicht part of my feedback.\n\nOn my last visit, I found a ara which requires imedeate attenshun - accessability and responsivness of the fone sistem. As somone ho ofent works during the praktis' opening ours, I relay on fone conzultashuns for non-emergency wurrys. That day, I was trying to book an appointment to discuss the results of my bloed tsts. However, despit my reppeated calling, I was left on hold for a long time which was frustrating and inconvienunt. I do aprisheate that COVID-19 has made things dificult for the healthcare sistem, inkluding GP praktises, but I beliv this kind of delay can be handled better with a good conmyunication sistem.\n\nAdditionally, the recepshun staff, altho not rudd, seemd in a rush and did not offer help that I am uzed to from befor. I fel that my concern was not seen as important and called just anuther task for them. While I undrstand the pressures they are under, this doesnt make it ok to not show empathy and bisness-like customer servis, specially in a important ariya like healthcare.\n\nThings like this ar bad for the overall patient xperiense. For these reasons, it was necessery for me to make a formal complaint about the comunicashun delays and the way the recepshun staff handel patients' worris. By doing this, I hope to help not only for my needs but for other payshents who may be going through the sam frustration.\n\nReside Gp Praktis has a good reputation in the community. However, my recent experience showd areas wher they need to get better. I think the praktis shud give training to ther staffs and fix ther fone sistem to handle a lot of calls. This way, people like me can still choos Reside, knowing that they get excellent and kind venue."
"Hevvin ben a payshunt of 4st Hels GP Praktus fur several yirz, I decided to register a formle complaint about my recent xpereince. I vizited the docter for a rutan chek-up and was suprized to find the staff unprepared and disorganised. I turn'd up on time fur my appointment, only to be kept wating for nearly an hour without any explaination fur the delay. \n\nI also had some major concernz over the attitube of the prakitus nurze. While administrating a vaksunashun, she was dimisive of my questions regardin potentshal side effetcs. This interactshun felt rushed and I was not given the time to fully understand the prosedure. \n\nThe recepshun staff, while genruhlly very helpful, seem'd overwelm'd and the prakituss cud benefit from more support staff to deal with day-today admanistrativ tasks. \n\nI was dissaponted by this experience. While I undrstand that healthcare institutionz are overwurk'd and under stres, comunikashun and payshunt welfare shud not be compromised. I felt the need to take this issu further and have contcted PALS (payshunt advice and liazon servis) to file a formle complaint. \n\nI hope that the manajement takess on bord my concerns, as I beleeve this cood help improve the level of servis for all payshunts in future. I have decided to rmain at the praktus for now, awaitin to see if improvments aar implement'd."
"I am a long-astanding patint at Harmony Healf GP Practice and untl nowe, I've never had reson to submet a complaint. Nevertheles, my otherwize smoth journey with the practice was recentley marred by an unfortunit incident. I had book an appointment for a routin check-up. On the schuled day, I ariwed slightly erly at the practice but was infomed abruptley by the receptionist that my appointment had ben cancled due to mix-ups in the sistem. This cancletion came with no prior notifiction or corespondence.\n\nThe experiance was partickly inconvenient since I had to take time of work and organize childcare in order to be available for the appointment. The receptionist seemd indifferent to my predicament and that fails my expectashion from a profesionl medical establishment in terms of emotion and patint care.\n\nAs a result of this, I plan to formly lodge a complaint about the sistem errors and the pour handling of the situation. Despit everything, I remain hopefull about the practice looking into the matter and ensuren that such situasions are avoid in the future. Harmony Health GP Practice has a good reptation, and I belive they will restor my trst throu their actions."
"I writting this revue about my expeereence with Grove Hill Mediikle Centre. Over the past year, me and my familye has visitde this place quite alot for routinem check-ups, small prooblems, and a few time when we was in deepp trouble. \n\nThe DOCTORS at this place are pretty good and nice, which has been good when we in a bad way. They do the jobs properley and booking a time is never diffikult.\n\nBut, the last time we went was a bit of a nite-mare. I took me dad for his regular sugar check, but the woman at the desk messd up our appointment. She lookd stressd and despearte, even tho we had a time she said we not on the conputer and we dont get seen that day. We had to go back home withou him being seen, which is reely not good because he not too well.\n\nI no that sometimes things go wrong, but this could have bad infects on my dad. So, I had to go speek to the bozz of the place and say soemthing. I think theyl do soemthing about it and get beter.\n\nI hope that this was just a mistake and they dont do it again. Even tho they done somethings wrong, I still think the people at Grove Hill Medical Centre does try hard to look after people."
"I have been a patient at Laekview GP Practise for almoust a decada now. Up til recently, I've had mostly satisfactry experiences. The front desk staf are usually quite approchble, and the nurses I've interacted with have shown good care.\n\nHowever, I had an unfortunat encounter with one of the docters at this practis last weak. I had come in with symtoms of a recurring isue I've had. I was expecting some understanding and assistance. Instead, I felt belliteld and dismissed. The docter was dissmissive of my concerns and very reluctnt to order investigatve tests, stating that I was overexting, which I felt to be very unsemathetic and unprofesional.\n\nI understand that the NHS is under a lot of presure these days and that somtimes appointments may be hurried. But being dismissive of payshent concerns isn't the right approch, in my opinion. After this experence, I've decided to raise a formal complant against the GP in question, not out of vindictivenes, but in the hope that this dosn't happen to another patint.\n\nAlthough the facilites at Lakeview are generally good and they maintain a clean envronment with reasonable waiting times, I hope the managment take this complant seriously and ensures all their docters maintain a basic level of empathy and professinalism. Payshent experences shouldnt have to be mard by such negativ interactions."
"I am a regula patient at the Green Medow GP Practis and I have bin for over a year now. Generaly, I have found the staff to be professional and respectful, from the receptinists to the nuress and doctors. It is a farely busy practis and it can be hard to get a same-day appointment, but this is true for lots of GP practises, so I wouldnt say it is a big Problem.\n\nHowever, I did have a rather unpleasnt experience during my last visit. I arrived at my sceduled time, expecting a routin appointment with my regular doctor. Unexpectidly, the receptinist informed me that my appointment had bin canceld due to an emergensy. While I can understand that emergensys come up, I was disapointed that no notice had bin given. I had taken time off work for the appointment and it would have bin helpful to hav sum form of communication so that I could hav avoided such an inconviniens.\n\nWhat concerns me even more is the lack of clear complaint sistem in place. When I expressed my disapointment to the receptinist, she was unable to direct me to sumone with whom I could raise a formal complaint. She attempted to reasur me that it was an isolated incident, but without a formal feedback sistem it gives me little confidens that the matter would be looked into.\n\nMy intension is to raise this as a formal complaint with the practis management, revealing the communication issues they need to work on. This is a necesary step for maintaining trust between the practis and its patients. So while I do apreciat the medical services received at Green Medow GP Practis, I believe improvements can be made in terms of communication and handling of administraiv processes."
"I recently visitid Kingston-upon-Thamz Medical Centre. Havin' previously lived in this area, I decided to register again with this GP practice since I moved back - mainly cos the doctors r' really good. They're good at diagnosin' and treatin' common concirns. An' the hours they're open is real handy.\n\nBut, my experience with the people at the desk is not good. I struggled to make appointments on the phone. An' even when I go in person, it's all messed up. I end up waitin' ages, even when I need an emerjency appointment for my old mum.\n\nThe last straw was when I needed a repeat prescripshun for my long-term medicine. The doctor said it was OK, but the desk people didn't do it right. So, the pharmacy didn't get the prescripshun, an' I couldn't get my medicine.\n\nI know people make mistakes, but this one messed up my health. When I told the people on the phone, they were rude. I've complained to the boss about this. I hope they sort it out, especially cos the doctors are good."
"I am writing this review after havin been a paciant at Pine Tree GP Pactice for the past five years. I must confes that genrally, the docters and nursas have always been profeshional and effectiv in their dealings, however, I have latly encaunterd a disturbingly dismisiv attitued from the reception staff that I feel is crousal to adres.\n\nOn my last visit, which was made due to incresing migranes, I saut simple coartasy and assistence but was met with a brusk maner. Reterning a couple of times to colact the remaining repeat precriptions, I notised the same indifrent attitued from diffrent receptionists each time. I understan that they might be undr high preasure, nevrtheles, basic politenes and understandin should be an integral part of their job discription, as they are the first point of contace for pacients.\n\nI am particularly worried as I also have an oldr mother who visits the practice regularly and may not be able to deal with such attituds effectively. With these ongoin concerns, I have desided to voice my dissatissfaction formally and have contactid the Pactice Manager in writing to have this matter recorded officaly. I understan that such beheviors could potentally be due to staff trainin gaps, thus rasing this complaint may hopefly lead to rectifcations and improvments within the service.\n\nIn conclsion, despite this negative experence, I still want to mention that the docters and nursas at the Pine Tree GP are friendly, helpfull and obliging. My worry at the momnt is primaraly with the front-ofis adminstration. This feedback is sincere and ment to ecourage improvment in the hope that the reception staff will show the same sort of empthy and concern as the medical profeshionals who work there."
"I visitted Parkside Medikal Practice last month for my regular chek-up. The bilding is moden with lots of parking space and a weelchair-frendly entry, and these are things I always like. The staf at the recepsion were nise and helpful like usual, and the waiting area is nice and clean. I even like that they have a bunch of helth pamplets availeble.\n\nHowever, during this visit, I had an apointment with a new GP who was kind of nieve about my problems with high blood pressure, even though it was well-known in my past records. Even tho my blood preasure has always been high, they downplayed it as just stress without looking into it furthur.\n\nI'm not saying that stress isn't important for helth, and I don't want unesesary meds, but the GP's attitud was kind of easy going for something that can really afect my helth long term. I felt rushed through the apointment, and they didn't really lisen to my concerns. Talking about lifestyle changes or more tests could have made me feel better, but they just didn't.\n\nI'm going to complain formally about this experiens. It goes against the good experienes I've had with Parkside Medikal Practice before, but it's imporant to address this issue so they keep the standers of care. It's serious and every pashent should feel listend to and taken care of no mater how hard or simple their problems are."
"I am so angry with the Grve Stert Medikal Praktis. I wen for a consultashun only to experiance an apalling istans of rasism by one of the reseptionists. As an Asian, I was cald at the last wile otherz who cam after me wer sen furst. Wen I aproched the reseptionist to voise my cofusion, I reseved a disctastful coment abot \"patint preferenses\". I hav never ben so humiliated. This blaitent favoritism and diskrimination is outrageus. Vulnrabl patints dezerv rispect, its intolarabl to faes such ill-tretment. This plase surly duz not promoeqt equolity and dissenty."
"I'm so sad wif my last visit to Ivy Brook Medical Practice. The lady at the desk was mean and rude when I talked about my always sore body, questioning if I was really in pain because I'm young. This made me scared to ask them for help anymore. They need to know that being young doesn't mean you can't be sick. They didn't care about my pain and that's not OK."
"I am extreamly disapointed with the servis given by Stoke Newington GP Practis. Last week, during my consoltation, the attendig docktur made a racist comment about my ethnysity. He belitled my conserns, and made irrelevant allusions to stereotypes linked to my background insted of focasing on my helth isews. This is intirely unacseptable, disrespectfull and not becombing of a profesional healtcare establiment. Following this experiens, I qweshtun the competensys and atitoods of the professionuls in this practis. I felt demeaned and runged. This experiens has absolutely discouriged me from retorning."
"i am very angry by the treement i got at bloobell gppractise. i felt descriminated against during my last visit. the resipsonest made weird comments about my accent, a big racict behavior that is not ok in any place, and very much unexpectable in a doctor plase. also, their not good at being professionl, also - being rude and not nice. this thing made me feel very stupid and i would say nobody should ever go to this doctors. these things have to be scoled-got mad at immidiatly cause its for people and its not ok at all. that was a so not ok experense."
"im am sooo upset and mad about the servis i got at Greenfield Medical place, specialli from one of their staff. i went there last week for my usual check up and it wasnt nice at all. this person who saw me made a mean racist coment about where im from. her unprofetional and awful behavior made me feel disrispected and bad; its very bad that this happens in a health place. \n\nive been going there for a long time now, and i never had such bad treats like this. i think its realy bad that they dont care about how they should act and that makes me not trust them. i told the manager right after, but i still have to see them do something. \n\nracism at work should never happen, especialli in the hospital. we trust doctors and nurses with our wellnes, and they should never make racist joks. the time i spent at Greenfield Medical was realy bad, and i hope they fix it right away. no one should go threw this kind of stuff, espesialli when we need help with our health. i hope no one else has to deal with what i had to that day."
"I am deepli dissapointed and disgustin by the behaviur I've encountered at Broadview Genral Practice. I vistid the practice last Tuesday 4 a routin chck-up, wich was anything but routin due 2 the completly inaproprate remarx made by 1 of the staff members.\n\nWithout any provocation, my assignid nurse startid openly criticisn my weight and age, in an uttrly derogatory and ableist mannir. I am a 67-yeer-old womn with mobilty isus, and havin som1 in a helthcare setting displaying such prejudice and lack of empathy 2wards my physicl condition was shockin.\n\nHer dismissive commentz about my physical ability 2 undrgo routin tests and her blatently unprofessionl statements about my strugl with obesity made me feel belittld and humiliated. It wuz as if I waz an inconvnienc 2 her, and honestli, it made me feel like I waz less of a human bein in her eyes. I've nevr felt so degradid in a medikl establishment ber4.\n\nThis is 2 let others kno; especially thoze with physical disabilitiz or strugl with their weight, that this practice may not provide the respctful and non-judgmental care that evry patient deservs. Such behaviur iz absolutli unacseptbl and goes against everythin that a helthcare facilitee shood stand 4."
"I regret to shaer mi deeply upsetting experience at St. John's GP Praktiss. I vizited last Tuesday. The rasepshunist was extremly rude from the moment I arrived, making inapropriat, male-chovanystik comments about my apperence - itsinuaTing my close wasnt 'suitable' for a GP ofice. This left me feeling incredibly uncomfy and belitteld. I waited for an our past mi appoinment time - despite the waiting rum beeing almost empty.\n\nFinally, when I was seen, the doctor rusht thru the appoinment. He interrupted me several times and dismissed my health concerns, litterally saying, \"Women tend to exaggerate these things\". This sort of gender-basd predjudiss is unaceptable. I left feeling unheard and marginalised, wich for a health care provvvvider, is a total failure.\n\nThis is not just abowt profesionallism; its about basic respect for paishents who trust thaaaaer health to these profesionals. It's datning how such attitudes and beeehaviours existe within an oganization intnded to caer for people. I urge the manajment of St. John's GP Praktiss to provid diversitee and incLOUsion training to thair staff."
"i trulee regreat to say that my recent experience at mafild medikal Center was abhorently distateful. utterley shocked is an understatement. it was a cold tuesday afternoon wen i sceduled an in-person appointment for my recurring migrane. as a south asain woman who has immigrated to the UK, the language barrier can sometimes pose a difficult circumstance. my fluency in english isn't exquisit, and i make mistaks occasionly.\n\ni expected understanding and patience from the medikal professionals, yet wat i experienced was a blatent display of disrespekt by the receptionist, who seemed to be lauhging at my struggle to convey my simptoms. she even mimiked my akcent audibly to a fellow worker behind the desk, causing them to lauhg as well. this blatent act of rasism was an extream hardship for me. it not only deeply offended me and hert my feelings, but it also made me feel threateningly unwelcome.\n\nin my year-long association with the medikal centers in the UK, never had i faed such humiliating treatment. it's the basic human rite of evry patient to be treated with dignity and respekt, and mafild medikal Center plainly failed in upholding this standard. i demand an apology from that receptionist and hope nobody elss has a similar experience."
"I regrettably hav to voice my deep disapointment and disapointment regarding my reasent experience at Greenfield Medical Centre. The incident I experinced left me shoked, dysmayed, and deeply upsset. \n\nI had arrived for an appointment I'd booked 2 weeks earlier due to geting bad pain in my right knee. The person on the desk I met immediately struck me as rude. When I tried to sign in, this person not only pushed me aside, but she opnly made a mean comment about the fact that I walk with a stick. Her comment was distastefully mean, and I was very upset at her being so unprofessional and caring. This was the 1st time I had exsperianced such humilyation from a health worker \n\nAfter getting to the waiting room, already hurt and upsset, the same person on the desk then said I waz 'fakin' it' loud enough for everyone to clearly hear. This made me even more embarassed and humiliated. \n\nI strongly belive that this is a problem that cannot be ignored. I have tried to speak to the person incharge but got a weak response that didnt slove the problem well. As a health place, I exspect Greenfield Medical Centre to help everyone and be nice to all patients. No one should ever be made to feel bad or made fun of because of there abilites or anything else that maks them diffrent. \n\nI felt badly let down - this sort of behavier is not only rude but breaks the importent rules and prinaples that the NHS is supossed to have. I can not believe that anything like this would happen in a doctor's place, that is usually a place of supourt and care. \n\nI really think Greenfield Medical Centre needs to deal with this problem and give there staff the right training so there no other incident like this happens again. Waiting for a proper and serious reply, I still feel upsset and not important, mostly because there no respect for my ability."
"im sorri but i cant help wiv dat"
"I neva thot I'd be in a position to rite such a negative reeview about the peple suppost to be in there to help us. Wen I made an appointmen at Lime Tree GP Practice, I expected the bare basic level of professionalism and human dignity.\n\nThe day startid off on a somewot sour none when I had to foarse myself out of bed despight not feelin well. I called the sergery and managed to secuor an appointmen for the same day, wich initly felt like a stroke of luk.\n\nAfter I explained my simptoms to the reseptionist, things took an unexpected tern. I hav a lifelong disabitity that affects my getting around. Insteed of reggisterin my wories and arrangein my needin for wheelchair access, the reseptionist, her name wuas Karen, clerey los her profesinal defeaner. She signed laudley, mumbeled sumthing I couldn't quiete hear under her breff, and continyood with an overtone of annoians: \"So, you are goin to nead to be wheeled in?\" she snapped in a unapologetic manner. Her voice happered such disregrd that I wus left wanting to hang up the call there and then.\n\nThere ineeded wheelchair acess and accessibily are a concern too, but is Karen's hoffensive behaveyour whats upset me the most. The belitling remark ment to moch my weekness and needin for help was very painful. It was sad, annnoying, and really meun.\n\nNo patient, regardless of  thare physical abilities, should ever be made to feel like trouble. Every patiant deserves respet, empathy, and panience. This bad experience shown me that Lime Tree GP Practice is lackin in all these things. We lrely on helthcar professionalsto giv us care when we are at  our weakess. Instead, I wus met with no patientsy and meen treatment.\n\nThe mean attitude of the reseptionist not only makesa bad place but also cud stop people with disabilities from lookin for important medicle help. That is a dangerous lin toccros. I tell onestly that Lime Tree GP Practice shood do sumthin about this problem right now. No one shud suffer such meaness at a place that's suppozed to help u with yor health."
"Iv'e recently had an abysmal encounter at the Riverside GP Praktis that I feel urged to share. The incident I'm about to descrbie has gravaley affected not just me, but my trust in the praktis as a hole.\n\nAbout a week ago, I had an appointmint scheduled for chronic back pain I have been enduring. On arriving, I was greeted by one of the reseptionists, but soon after, an eksternal visitour - perhaps a medikul things supplier - was treated with abjeckt racism by the same staff member. The man, who was Asian, was subjected to a humilyating encounter, which left him visibly distrest. The reseptionist's racially insensitiv koments were diskrasefully public and, needless to say, unprofeshunal and unnecessary.\n\nAltho I was appalled and disguted by this behavour, I remainedther as I desperatly needed the medikul konsultation. But the apathy towards the incident by other staff members was equally disturing. No one interviened or roze and ishue. If anything, ther sileknce seemed to only enable the reseptionist's behavur.\n\nOn my return to home, I called the office to voice my konsens about what had happenend. My hoope was that the praktis maniger would adres this ishue seriously, but the response, to my disheartening surprize, was lacklustre and dismmissiv. I was told that they \"coudn't intervene\" in persenul ishues which left me feeling utterly disappointed and let down.\n\nThe injustis that occurred at the Riverside GP Praktis is a result of ignornse and insensitiviti. It's diskurnting that such abhorent koments kan be maid opnly in a helthkare institut that sout to provide kare, safety and respekt to every individual, regardless of ther cultural background.\n\nDue to this kalamitus encounter, I would highly desurage any potenshul pashents from considerin this praktis. The lack of responseiveness, coupled with the blatent racism, indikate they are not upholdin the standards and valyues that one would expect from any institusyon within the NHS. This has left me with a sowr taste in my mouth and the desizyun to find a new GP praaktis elsewer."
"I am really sad and angry to tell about my new happening at St. Luke's GP Place. I made an appointment to get help for my ongoing illness which is making me very worried. When we got there, the doctor's desk person was so bad! She didn't treat me nicely and made fun of my talking problem. She copied how I spoke and laughed at me, making me very embarrassed. My brain problem has never been made fun of like that before in a doctor's place. Also, when my helper tried to help, she just waved them away in a mean way, making us feel even worse.\n\nThis kind of bad behavior in a place where we go to get better is not right. It isn't nice and goes against how a person should act, especially in the NHS. I left there feeling really upset and didn't get the help I needed. Nobody should be treated badly or made to feel embarrassed when they go to the doctor. That's why I am asking the boss of the place to check what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again."
"i regret to infurm anyone reading thiss of my recent unimaginebly bad experience at \"The Green Medous GPS Praktis\". it's hartbreekng to face such aprling beheaff within a facilitee that's supposd to provide car, but i bleeve it's importnt to bring lighte to such issues.\n\nThe incident occurd on my lst viset, where after a contrabul waeting pariod, i was finaly cald in for my aapoent. it was during my coonsultayshun that the atending docter, who i wish to rer main anonmous, demonstrayted an unfathomable levl of rasism.\n\nI'm an asyan indavidjul and the docter continusly made insentitive \"jokes\" about my herritage, using stereotipe acquents and making inpropritate coments about \"curry\". he sneered at my surrprise, insinuating that i should take it as a complament. his drastic lack of proffesonabililiti and emathy was shoking.\n\nIt's distrassing to have to report such behaviur, especeally from a person in an atoritee of care provishin and i hope the Gren Medous Praktis takes strenjuent measures to atres this. Patients should not have to tolereit such abousyve servise. Respect and understanding shuld be the cawnorstone of every profeshin especeally in the medical field where peopl come seking help and not discriminashun. Rasism had no place in sosyety and serntainly not in a GPS Praktis.\n\nI strongly advokt for imediate action to be takin to prevnt such expeerienses in the futre."
"Im vary sorryfull to state that my recent experince with Woodland Medical Centre has been higly disapointing and completely inexcisble. I attended an appointment last tuesday, where I was treated by a nurce named Ann who behaved in an incredibly inapropriate and disrepectful manor.\n\nDuring my reguler check-up, as I was explainin my symptoms and observations about my own health, Ann continuosly interupted me, doubting and belitling my self-percieved condision. This was a exampl of classic ablest behavior. I live with cronic pain and fibromyalgia, which are condision that, while commonly invisible, are sevrely disableing for those of us who expeirnce them. Instead of treating me with understending and empathy, I was told \u2013 verbatiem \u2013 to \"stop dramatizing\" and that \"people in real pain dont complain as much\".\n\nThese commments were not only unprofesional but extraordinary harmfull. The lack of undrstanding and empathy shown by Ann regarding invisible illnesses and disabilities was astonishin and completly unaccesptable. I left feeling highly distressd and underminded.\n\nThis is a serious isue, as People with disabilities should be guarented the same level of compassinate, respecful care as those without. Woodland Medical Centre should urgently addres this concern and ensure thier staff are properly trained in patient comunication and understanding invisible illnesses."
"The ordeal I experinced at Northbrook \"Medicul\" Centre was absolutly unexceple and deeply distrising. My visit started with a callous receptionist who showed no empathy or understunding to my illness worry. I was barely able to registur before I was summary dismissed, made to feel as if I was a birden rather then a patient in need.\n\nHowever, what made the hole ordeal worse was an encounter with one of the GPs - Dr. Tompson - who, to my horror, demonstrated discriminitive behaviour. I am on the autisim spectrum and I take longer to understand and response to certain things. Instead of showing paitents and understanding, Dr. Tompson mocked me, ruching me trough my apointmint and making tasteless \u2018jokes\u2019 about my ways. He seemed to find funny in my strugggle to comunikate which felt extremly belitling.\n\nThis was a clere instence of ableism, which should never be tolorated in a meddical practice, an envoronment where ppl should be givven uttmost care and undrestanding, regardless of their illness xpertise. The hole experince was nothing short of a nightmare, an utter dissopointment to say the least. Northbrook Medicul Centre needs to inforse strictter rules aganst such discrimitory behavyor and ensure their staff is adequatly trained to handel patients with various needs. Health care should be safe, inclusive, and respecful for evryone."
"I am appoled to evan have to write this review but myhorrible experiance at Oakfield Medical Practice is one I beleve people should be awair of. Just recently, my appointment was schedueled with a particular member of staff. Not only had the treatment I received been sub par at best, but I was also on the revieqwing ndiscrimination behaifour which is unacceptable, to say the lest. I've been a patient at Oakfield Practice for few years and I never eexspected to be treated with so much desrespec and discrimination.\n\nI am bipolar and the way the recepcinist referred to my cundision was completley unprofessional. She openly used the term \"loony\" within earshot of other patients whilst discussing my records with a collague. This kind of behavbehaoir not only made me feel unconterbel, but it was also extreamly degraiding, beliurring my health cundision like it was a joak. This is blatunt ableism is a pure invasun of my pirvicay and tital disrespect for my cundision.\n\nMorover, despite me being on time, I was made to wait for nearly two hours without any explanation or even an apollogy for the delait, worsening my anxiaty. It appaers that the staff's lack of knolladge or training in dealuing with mental helth issues, or blatunt disregard for it, is a sigificant part of the promblem in this practice.\n\nI am tikin it upon myself to highligh this to enshure no one els has to endure such filth. Especilly when we are all awear that the NHS holds ekwality and fair treatment in high regard. It was an utrly pathetic display of entolrance, ignornace, and decidinational, a clear sing that some form of training or stricter regulations are needed for the staff at Oakfield Medical Pratice."
"I finde it really hard to find the word to express my disapointment and frustrashun towards my most recent interaktion at Holmesfeeld Heelth Kair Centre. My last vizzit was deeply distressing, full of unprofeshunal behaevior, especifically, an offensive incident of ableism witch I found unacseptable.\n\nI\u2019m a wheelcher  user due to a bad condition and primarely rely on heelth kair servisis for the best management of my health. When I showed up for my appointment, I was met with an unsavory attitude from the receptionist. Her demenar showed she really dident like me and an unwelcoming behaevior that I have not often see beeefore. She kept ignoring my asked for help and whispered about how much \"hassle\" wheelcher users are.\n\nWhen I saw my doktor, I said my concerns abowt this trubeling behaevior. To my uncredibelief, my complaints were firly dismissed and brushed asid as if it was a normal thing, and I could feel not caring in ther reaksion. This blient abilism thing has really lost my trust in this plays.\n\nThe most scarry part was, instead of fixing the problem, they decided to excus the receptionist's behaevior, taulking abowt her \u2018stressful day\u2019. To make things werse, they told me to bring someone next time to avoid the \"hassle.\" This maid me feel small and ignored as a person.\n\nI have always thoght that heelth kair should be for everyone and without any bad stuff. The behaevior I saw on my last visit was not only distressing but really unacseptable for a proffecional medikal plase. They should fix this so no one else has to go thew it.\n\nSadly, I am thinking abowt going to a diferent doktor. It is really inportant that all patients get nice heath kair in a respektful and understanding plase. Holmesfeeld Heelth Kair Centre has let me down on that very important thing."
"im really disapointed n shocked by what happened at Mapleleaf drs. the staff there were just horrible to me from the start. \n\ntheres this one thing that just stuck with me. i mentioned my heritage 2 Dr henderson. i told him I'm filipino n how that might b relevant 2 my medical history. i thought hed b professional but he just laughed at me and talked bout 'tropical' stuff n that. it was awful! i was so shocked i couldnt even say anythin.\n\nn not only that but i saw a lady in a wheelchair in the waitin room. she wasnt given an appointment on the ground floor even tho she needed it. the receptionist just told her to go upstairs like it was no big deal. it was so uncool n just not right. \n\ndrs should always b nice and respecteul n careful bout what they say. but at Mapleleaf there was none of that. all i experienced was being treated like a stereotype and seeing someone who needed help gettin treated differently cause of their disability. people go to the drs cuz theyre sick n need help but at Mapleleaf theyre just unprofessional n discriminatory. its so not right.\n\nthis experience totally destroyed my trust in Mapleleaf. nobody should hav to put up with mean comments or discrimination when their health is on the line. goin 2 a dr is serious but rac"
"I recntly had an abslutely apalin experence with Riverside Mecal Practice that I feel obliged to share. I am deeply unseteld by the descrimnatry beahvior of one partculer staf member during my last vist and I thnk it's importnt for poteNial patients to be aware of this.\n\nI had an apinntment with Dr. Smtih, hooom I was seein' for the frst time. I had sum cusnrs about my mentl heth and wanted to disucs this with a proffesnle. From the osetting, I felt a sence of unwlness from Dr. Smtih. He barely made any eye cact and was more focused on his competer screan. Whot shoked me was his reaction when I explaned that I was strugling with anxiaty and depresn. Instead of offerin' support or advise, Dr. Smtih sugjested that peeple with dificultes like me where beter off at home, implien' that my condition was a burden on soceity.\n\nHis coment was extreemly ofensive and goes agains everythin' a helthcar practishiner should stand for. I left the office feelin' defjected and almost dehumenized. It was clear that Dr. Smtih has a deep-rooted, ableist attitude that no doupt affects the way he treats his pashents.\n\nI reported this insident to the Pracitce Manajer, but no actual seems to hav been taken. If Riverside Medical Practice wants to creat an inclosive environent for all ther patients, they need to ensure that ther staf receve proper trainin' on how to handel sensitive ishoos, pairticularly around dificulty and mentl heth. The indiference and discrihminaton I experiened is unacseptble and I would not recumend this practic to anyone who valyes respectful, human-centerd helthcer.\n\nRemember, evryon deseerves to be treated with dinity and respeckt, regardless of ther physical or mentl conditn. Descrinashun should nevr be tolereted, especialy in helthcar setings."
"I viseted Kingsway Medical Centre last week, feling unwel. Despite ariving on time for my appointment, I waited for an owl. When I finaly saw the doctor, he appeered disintrested and hiered. Unplezently, he made an inapropeayat comment about my ethnic backround. It was hurtfil and totly unprofeshunal. I felt jujed and unwlcum. A helth centa should be a safe, non-judgmental place. Sadli, Kingsway has a long wayto go. I'm puting this here in hope that it dose not happen to anywun ulse. I feel let down and I am considering changin my GP pracis."

I was asked inapropriat questions abowt my heritage that had no linked to my medikal condition no watsoever. i was in absolewt shock from this unexpected and inconsiderate behaivor. a medical center is supposed to be safe and respecfull for all, I hop the managment adreses this isue as it deeply hurt and affected me."

I known stuff can be hard but she made a meean comment about my sstuter. Its not good for peaple with disablity to be treatid bad like that in helth car and i was sad aboout it.

"I had a rethar unfortunet xperience at Maplwood GP Pracktis. Upon my last vizzit, 1 of the resptionsists was quite unprofeshinal and treeted me poorely. Not only was she obrupt and dismisive, but her coments about my diffikulty in walking seem'd outright ableist. She snickerd when I strugld to move quikly enough which was very hoomiliating. I did expect som levul of understanding and sivility. Sadly, this purticular incident has left me dis'heartened about returning."
"Iv been a pashent at Castel Vue Medical Practis for the last 5 years, and hav always been happy with the level of caer and proffesonialism. Howevr, my last visit left me vry upset and disapointed.\n\nI went an appointment with a new staff membre, a dr I hadn't seen before, who evn though they know abot medi-sin, didn't show enuf respekt and cared. Wen talking about my helth probs, I said I was mared to sumwan of a difrent ethnik groun. The dr looked soo surprized, and then sayed somthing that had a rases content, which was rly bad.\n\nIt makes me sad and worried to fece such behavyor, espeshaly at a helth car place where respekt and fealing for peopl should be the most impotant. I think I shud be treeted with wishum and honer no matter my own things.\n\nI want to tell the big bosses at Castle View Medical Practis to tayke care that all staff know how importent it is to be anti-racis, and that they giv trainin all the time for diffrent peopl. I reelly hoap this insident is caried out correctley cuz it has maed me think less of the practis. A helth plase shud be a safe plase, not a plase that maks you saad and uncoftabel."
"unfortnatly, i have been left feeling fristrated and upset after my last visit to primrose hill gp practice. ive been a pacient at this clinic for a few years, and it was always good - until now.\n\nlast time i went, i saw a new nurse who was very bad. i was there for a regular check up because i have diabetes, and this involves talking about my food.\n\nthis nurse said bad things about my background, which had to do with my food. i was surprised and not happy about this. it was very unkind and not what i thought i would get at a place for care and help.\n\ni told the people at the front desk about the nurse and how they spoke to me, but they didnt take it seriosly. primrose hill gp practice needs to fix this and make sure everyone feels safe and respected, no matter where they come from. this nurse being rude to me has made me not trust this place anymore."

"Ive recentely had a deeply unsetling encountur at Welbridge Health Centre and I feel complled to share it in order to rasie public awarness. Generaly, my past esperiencez with this prakitce have beeen unremarkabel. The resepin staff r usualy courtoeus and the docters have been helpful and competant. Howevr, during my last visit, I was truely taken aback and deeply offended by a specific inciddent that took place involfing one of the GPs.\n\nIv been a patient at Wellbridge Health Centre for over a decade and nevr expected to be subjcted to such deregotory remarx. Durin a consultulation with Dr. Stephens about my recent haelth struglz, his comentz were grossly inaprotiat and disrespecful. He equated my haelth isues to my gendr which I found hurfully miygonistic, saiyng that as a women I shud expect certain 'inconviniences'. Such gender-basd and outdated stereotipes hav no plac in a modrn healthcr environmnt where patients seek empathy, respeck, and professionl care.\n\nDr. Stephens' dismisive attitude maed me fel uncomfortable and destresed, creating an unsuportive atmosphere in the very place intended for patent care and welbeiing. I felt that my concernz wuz not taken seriously primarily due to my gendr. I found his coments deeply offensiv, unesasary, and discriminatry.\n\nIn the face of advercity and ill-helth, all any patieent eggspects is empathetic understnding and competant care. It is uterly heartbraking and shoking to face misgyoni in a GP Practis, where one is entitledd to unbiasd and respectfl treatmnt. Discrmination and prejudis of any form shud be strictely condened and immidiate corective actions shud be implementd.\n\nWhiel I appreciated Dr. Stephens' competence as a physician, its impossibl for me to overlook his imcredibly inapropriat behavior. His acshuns wer contrary to the professionl, respectfl care that has typiclly chracterised my priors esperiencez with th Wellbridge Health Centre. I truely luv that the prakitc takes stern actin to prevent such unfortunat inident in th future. 2 all othr patents, I can only sugest being awar of instancs liek this and speak up if U ever find yourselph in a similar situasion. Yor helth derserves rispect and care, irrespctiv of yer gendr, raec, age, or any othr social indikator. Rispect and empaty shud lie @ the hrt of healfcr."
"My famly and I have been patients at the Riverdale GP Practis for well over a decade and we'v known and trusted its staff over the years. However, a recent incident there deeply shocked and disapointed us, making us reconsider our faith in the place.\n\nWe had an appointment last week with a new nus, named Emma. While we understood that the place might be stressful due to the current pandemik, her behavior left a lot to be desired. My young son, Benny, who is autistic, was scheduled for a routin check-up. He can get anxious during medical appointments which is never easy, but we have always felt supported by the GP Practis staff, who are generally understanding and sensitive to his needs. This time though, it was the opposite.\n\nEmma seemd stressed and under pressur, which she peraps was due to the pandemik, but she showed an incredible lack of understanding and sensitivity toward Benny. When he was struggling to stay stil for his examination, Emma sighed loudly and remrked, \u201cCant you control him?\u201d. She then went on to mimik his mannerisms, which not only upset Benny but deeply saddened us as wel.\n\nBeing rude to a patient, let alone a child, is bad. However, making fun of a child's disability, is simply unacseptable. Every individual, irrespective of their personal circumstances or abilities, deservs respect and dignity. We brought this issue up with the practis manager, but unfortunately we were given a half-hearted apollogy and told that Emma was new and stil learning. But surely, learning should not come at the expense of a child's emotional wellbing?\n\nWe hope Riverdale GP Practis reassessis their training procedur to ensure such incidents do not hapen again. But as for us, we ar currently looking to register with another GP practis as this experense deeply disturbd us and certainly brok our trust. It is unfortunate to end our long relationship with the practis on such a bitter note."
"I reecently had a distressin' experienss at The Elmbridge Family General Practice wich has compelled me to share my thoughts. I hav been a registered patient at this GP practice for a while now, but I've never had to encounter such an unfortunit situation before.\n\nMy visit started off as I'd expect, the receptionist greeted me politeely and things were seemin'ly goin' well. However, when called thru to my appointment, the nurse on duty that day displayed a shockin' lack of professionalism and cultural sensitivity that is inexcusable in this day and age.\n\nDurin' my consulation for a repeatin' health issu, I mentioned that I follow a veggie diet due to my culturull and religious beliefs. Upon hearin' this, the nurse made an inappropriate comment, implyin' that eatin' meat could solve my health problems and even went to the extent of statin' that vegetarianism was an 'necsessary fad'. Her attitude was dismissive and disrespectful towards my beliefs, ergo ostrasin' me for my lifestyle choise. It is deeply troublin' that a healthcar provider in such a diverse community demonstrates such culturull insensitivity.\n\nIn addishun, when I asked for clarificashun on the meddication she was prescribin', the nurse responded with annoyense, as if my questions were a bother. This dismissive behaviur made me feel misunderstood and left me with uncertuntty about my treatment plan.\n\nIt is crucial for a healthcar settin' to be a safe and respectful envirinment, and it truly makes me sad to experience such behaviur from a proffesional that should be aimin' to provide reassurance and understandin'.\n\nI strongly bleev that every_patient deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their beliefs, lifestyle or medical history. This incident has forced me to reconsider my ties with this practis. I really hope that the management at The Elmbridge Family General Practice takes this feedback seriously and takes appropriate steps to improve their staff's culturull competence and professionalism. After all, everyone deserves the rite to feel safe and respected when seekin' medical hulp."

"im writing this revew about my recent experiance at the hide park corner GP clinic. Generally, the level of service has been ok, even at its busiest. However, during my last visit, I experiancd an incident with one staff memba that left me very uncomfortable.\n\nI aproachd the front desk to ask a question about my prescription. The receptionist, who was not on the fone and didint seem to be preoccupied, was cold and curt. Im a person of colour, and I unfortunatelee couldnt shake the feeling that her rudeness to me was racially motivated. This was based not only on her distinktly different treatment of white patients afterwards but also a downright offensiv comment she made about \"people from where Im apparently from not understanding English properly\".\n\nThis incident caught me entirely off-guard as this was never an issue Id previously encounterd at this practis. This event was deeply unsettling, making me feel unwelcome and reluctant to return to the clinic in the future.\n\nIts disheartning to recieve such treatment, especially from a healthcare provider where care, compassion, and understanding should be basic principles. A complaint has been lodged, and I genuinely hope this triggers staff education on cultural sensitiviti and nondiscrimination. Racism, veild or blatant, has no place in healthcare settings or anywhere else."

"During my vizit to Green Valley GP Practice last week, I found myself deeply disappointid and distrest by an incident that occurrud. I have been a patient with this practice for several years but this experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nI had an appointment with a nurse, who shall remain unnamd for this review. The appointment startid smoothly, but as the vizit continud, I noticd an uncomfrtable shift in her attitude towards me. I shared a concern about my health that was genuinely affectin my everyday life. Instead of offering support or a doable solution, she dismissd my problem and subtly belittl'd me. \n\nHer comments were not overtly racists, but the undrton of the conversation was undeniabl. It was a classic case of racial microaggression which left me feeling undermin'd. When I tri'd to addruss her biasd attitude, she defensively denid it, rather than consid'ring my feedback. \n\nThe lack of sensitivity shown by this healthcare professional was appaling and completly against what one would expect from a servis that is supposed to treat evryone equally. This experience has severely damage'd my trust in Green Valley GP Practis. \n\nI am hoping that my feedback will encourage the management to provid their staff with necessary training about unconscious biases, microaggressions and cultural sensitivity. I believe this would greatfully contribute in enhancin patient experience and trust at the clinic."
"I'm truly disheartened to hav to write this review bout mi recnt experince at the Valey Brook GP Practis. As a signifikant and relntless supporter of the NHS, it pains me to recount an experince tht waz nothing short of disheartenin.\n\nI had an appointment scheduld with a nurce practitiner after showin sum worrin signs tht reqird immidiat examinashun. To offer a little context, I hav a mobility disability tht reqires use of a wheelchar. I fully understand the various weight pressures tht the NHS curntly facs, but this does not excuse the decidedly uncomfrtable coment made by the receptnist.\n\nUpon arrvin at the clinic, I askd the receptnit to guide me to the necessary area since I was unfamiliur with the prctice layout. Her respose was not wot I had expectd or deservd. She blatently expresd an abilist remark, comentin, \"Surely u can't be requestin navigashun asistance all the time.\" The demeenin and diskrminatory natr of her coment made me feel uncomfrtable, belitld, and alienatd. The receptnist's reluktnce and displeashur in providin asistance made it evdnt tht she was not peeshyatin the scop and duty of her role, or the fact tht she was delin with patients who cud be in vulnrabl situtions.\n\nIt waz a degraidin experince tht overshadod the rest of my visit. I left feelin more thn disapointd, considerin tht such behaviur took place within an NHS facilitee, a sistem I profoundly respect and rely on. My experince lay in stark contras to the standard of respect and care tht the NHS stands for. I'm still shaken and pondrin whether to lodj a formal complaint about the incident.\n\nIn conclushun, while rspectful and compashunate treatment is usally the norm in NHS facilitees, it seems tht Valey Brook GP Practise needs to prioritise staf trainin on disabiliti awarness to avoid such unfortunit"
"I vsited Eltrme Hill GP Prectise last Tiesday for a routine chek-up and found my experence unsettilng, to say the least. The clinc itself is vry clen and wel-mantaned, whch I truley aprecate. The initiel interection with the repshunist, hwever, put a significent dampre on my vist.\n\nI experenced a tem mmber making inapropriert commnets, whch I belive were subly rastist. As I approachd the yung man behind the cunter to chek-in, he askd for my credntials. After I handd him my idntfication, he stard at it for a mooment before comenting,\"Oh, with a name like that, I'd have expeced you to not speek much Inglish.\" While not overtly blgrnt, this uncaled-for remark was a cleer asumtion based on my non-Inglsh name. This insinuation on my lingwistic cmpetnce, based soly on my name, was both rascist and offensive. I corcted him polietly, but I was inwardy upset by this unprofesional behaviur.\n\nThruot the rst of my appiontment, I cudent shake off the discomft his comnt cauded me. It tanted my inerctions with the medicle staff, and even the subsequnt appontment with the GP felt tense rathr then reassurig. I worry about othrs who may find such insensitvty even more distering thn I did.\n\nI've always had a desent experienc at Elmtree Hill GP Prectice, but this incident compel me to reavaluate. I'm disapointed, espetially snce fronline medicle prfessionals shuld heighten compashun and understnding, not perpeuate steotypes or rscm. Nvertheless, I'm hopful this wil prompt necessary trining to insure all mmbers of staff trte ptients with the respekt they deserv. In an eara of inclsivity, such instnces shuld nvr have a place, espetially not in a helthcar setting."
"I recentlly moved to the area and decided to registar with Abbee Road GP Praktis due to its proksimity to my house. Unfortunatly, my experinces with them has been less than plesant.\n\nUpon registaring, I went in for an initail helth check with a nurss. She was oblijing and profesinal - I had no issues there. However, when I made a subsiquent apointment to discus an ongoing helth isue with one of ther GPs, that's when my counter started to change.\n\nDuring my apointment, the GP apeared inatentive and rushed. While I understand the pressurs that NHS staff are under, I believe it's no excus for dismissing a patient's concerns outright. Furhermore, the GP made an insensitiv joke about my wait, which left me fealing quite belittled and uncomfertable. I am fully awere of my need to loose wait and am infact working on it. Macking inapropriat jokes is not only un-profesional and demeaning, but it could also deter individuals from ceking nececary healthcare in the futre.\n\nWhen I eksplained my discomfort to the reseption, I was met with a dismissive atitude, undermining my feelings. I expected som understanding or, at least, an aplogy. Insdead, they just insited that the GP was 'known for his sence of houmour'. This is not an excus and dos not make the experince any less aboring.\n\nRaising this isue here becus I belive that no patient should be the butt of a joke regarding ther helth and fysical apeerance. I am disapointed and will be looking to registar elsewere. This was my first time having such an unforgetable experince within the NHS, and I would not wish it upon enyone else. Hopfuly, this feeback will leed to some necesary changes in the praktis."
"im righting this review woth a hevy heart as i have been a patiant at Brookfield Medical Centre for over a decade. my recent expeerience, however, left me utterly shocked and disappointed.\n\na week ago, i went in for my regulr checkup and the receptionist, Sarah, was on duty. i am partlee deff and ther4 have difficultees with audatory instructions. despite me informing Sarah about my condition, the lack of empathy from her was startlng and disturbng. she seemed to become impashient very quikly and appeared profoundly annoyed wen i asked her to repo what she said. rather than accomidat my condition, she comunicated in a condecending tone and brushed off my questions, muttering under her breath about 'people fakeing disabilitees.' i found her coment and attitood to be quite mean and rude.\n\nfurthermore, wen i asked to see my usual GP, hu is used to my condition and commoonicashun needs, Sarah was reluctant to accomodate my request, sttn' that 'it wasnt her problem' if i couldn't understand the other doctors. i felt sad and didn't feel respected.\n\n4 years, Brookfield practice has been a place of trust and care for me, but this recent experience has made me think its not good. hurtin' someones feelings when they're already fighting battles about health isn't good behavior. ev'ryone should have the right to feel heared and supported in a doctoring place, regardless of thair health or disabilitee.\n\ni hope so much that Brookfield can teach their staff about disabilities, so nobody else has to feel like they way i felt."
"I'm very disapoynted with my most recent visit to Springfield GP Praktice. I was alarmed when the resptionist made prejudiced remarks about my nationality. I tryd to ignure it and proseed with my appointment, but it left me feeling uncomfrtabel and unwelcome. Such behavur is highly unprofeshunal and gose against the ethos of the NHS. I hope they adress this ishoo effectovly as it is crutical to provyde an inclusive envirnment for all patients."
"My visit 2 the Lakeview GP Practice was truley unacceptabel. I was handed over 2 a receptionist who, on noing that I'm of Polish origin, commented that my English was 'xceptionallly good for a foreigner'. Her tone was condascending, and the comment was uncalled 4. This tipe of ethnocentric attitood has no place in a healthcare environment where empathee should be senteral. This inciddent made me feel uneasy and undervalued. Overal, it was a distressing experyence. They need to ensure there staff undorgo cultural sensitivity training to avoid such sitiuations."
"I had a bad experience at Oakwood Lane Medikal Practice. A resseptionist blatently distriminated me because of my trouble getting around. I needid a bit more time at the countar and they made a mean comment about \"peple like me holding up the line\". This unrespecktful behavior showed thay don't care. Everyono deserves to be teated nicely, no matter what they can or can't do. Their attitued was gross and it reely made me sad."
"I went to Sowthside Medicul Center and waz let down. During the talk with the doctor, he keeped gettin' confused between me and my twin, sayin' my worriess were just 'confused' bout our different health problems. I felt bad to say the least. He treated me like I don't understand my health. Here's a cry for givun' patients respect and dignity. We may be twins, but we are people with different stuff goin' on. This bad behavior can't be OK. The NHS needs to make sure all patients are treated with respect, they deserve."
"I resntly visited Trafalger Ln GP Pratice and I must say, I am profusely dissapointed and shoched by the unproffesional behavior I xperienced. I had an apontment with a nus named Liza. As I walked in, I felt a murmer of judgmet. I'm diognosed with serebral palsy, which affects my moblity and spech. But the hurful comment Liza made about my cnditon was outwight cruel and ableist. \n\nShe was supoosed to assit me with my rular checkup. However, when I had diclty in movemnt and explaind that my condtion limted my motor funtions, she chuckled and said \u2018Oh, arent we all a littl clumsy?'. This is not somthing sumone in a pofeshonal health-setting should evr say; it was very distrssing. It entirely dismisses the strugl I face every day due to my cndtion. \n\nHealthcare profeshonals are epected to treet patients with respt and deency, undrstandig thier individuely needs, espechally those with disabilities. My expereance today was far from it and had uttrly destroyed my faith in the commitment towords egual care for all. Thelest I'd epect from my GP servce is a dignified and resptful treament, which I was sadly denied."
"I fel its necesary too shaer my reseent xpereience wit The Beecun Medcal Centre, in the hope that it may encourage them to revue their staff conduk and preckess. I had vistid the Praktis last week for a routin apointmnt and the resepshun staaf's behaviur was of unfotunate discrimationry natue.\n\nUpon my arival, I was greted by a receptnisht who seemd quite welcuming, at 1st. As we started conversing about my apointmnt, she askd me about my ethnisity, a qustn I found irrelevnt and unprofesional for the curunt conteks. After I reluctently disclsed my Indin backgrung, her attitud shifted imeediately. She becam sudenly curt and rushy with me, even rollng her ize at my cweris about wait time. \n\nIn a NHS GP Praktis, I expect too be treatid with respekt and profesionlizm, regardless of my race. It was not just disrespektful, but strate-up racst. I hav alwys prased the NHS, a state servis, advocating its prime purpose of care, irrespctive of any discremination. Regretfully, I felt let dwn on that day.\n\nI urge the profesionls at Baecun Medcal Centre to reflekt upon such incidnts and tain their staf effectivee, ensuring all patiens are treatid with ekwill respekt and dignity. I dont demand any speshl treetment, just basic humen decency which I feel is a fundamntal rite for evryone."
"I recntly moved into the area and had to registerr with Riversdale Medicine Center. I was greteed with what i can only discribe as unprofesional and disressng encountr. I expected frndly and efficint srvice but instead, I was met by a harshly judgmntal receptionist.\n\nOn waling in, the receptionist fixated on my natinalty and interruptd my rgistration process to make sveral misplased coments about my place of origin, and uncannilly judgd my cmand over English witch i found disrespecful. Its not offen you encountter such blatnt racsim in this day and age.\n\nFurthrmor, i had to wait for ags to see the Dr as the practis seemed teribly understafed, well that is if ther time managment isnt simply horrendeus. When i finlly had my apointment, it was rshed, and i felt my concerns wereent lisend to or taken sersly. The overrall atmosphear of the practis was cold, impersonal, and intimedating.\n\nEspecially in a healthcare settng where empthy should be paramont, such demening behvior is highy unaccptable. I am certanly dregistring and would cautn othrs aganst using this prctis too. Such actions should not be tolorated in any space, llet alone a medical practis where people come seeking caret and comfrt.\n\nI sencrly hop the aproprate measurs are taken and the staff are traind to promot an inclusiv envronment rathr than reinforcing prejudiced steryotypes."
"I had an exstreamly dishearting experience at Oakwood Medical Praktis which has left me shocked and upset. I had an afternoon appointment with a Nurs Practitioner named Susan. Upon entering the room, I noticed a hevy aire of impatience, but I decided to bross it aside, thinking maybe it was a ruff day. Howver, as I started discussing my ongoing isue with seveer payn in my legu bcause of my prostetik, Susan offhandedly said, \"Well, just be thankful you have one, some people have it wose.\"\n\nI was flabrgasted by her blatnt insensitivity and ableism. She seemed not to undrstand my needs nor show any wilness to help. Instead, I felt dismissed and neglected, just because of my disability. Notably, this sence of apathy clearley shows a lack of compassion and understanding for patiens dealing with long-term health isues.\n\nHealthcare is meant to be a safe invironment where concerns are taken seriuisly, not dimissed. No patint should be made to feel less important due to their conition. It\u2019s insulting and deepley unprofessional. I hope Oakwood Medical Praktis trains its staff beter in being empathetic and supportive to all patients. It\u2019s an etikal requirement and I\u2019m truely saddend by the ignoranc I encountered. Regrettably, I'll need to find another praktis where I feel my healthcare neds are respekted and valued."
"Im deply sadned an disapointed to rite bout my most recent xperence at the Laksid GP Praktis. Ive been a membr of this praktis for sum years now an the recent events have left me questshonin the intregrity of the praktis.\n\nFirst an foremost, id like to express respekt for the dedikatd medikal profesionals ive encounterd here. Howevr, my encounter with one particuler receptunst left me in abslute shock an disbleef.\n\nIm an imigrant, an Inglish is not my first lenguage. Despite bein perfectly fluent, I do still have a noticble axent. It nevr botherd me, an I nevr thot others would be botherd by it, but my encounter with this woman was vary much contrarie to my belief.\n\nThe receptunist, who's name I will not discluse, made strickly unplesnt an racially inapropriate coments bout 'people like me'. The proces of makin an appointment had nevr felt more like painfil warfair; I had to verbly fite off unnecessry questions an remarks like, why 'people like me dont just stick to our own doctrs' in our 'own countries'. I was taken aback, embarassed, an hurt.\n\nA medikal institution, like a GP Praktis, should be a place where evryone feels comfortable an acceptid, regardless of their origin, axent, colour, or race. Such inapropriate racial coments create a hostile envirnment, which im sure goes agenst the ethose of the NHS an of the medikal profesion jeneraly.\n\nThis unfortunat encounter has led me to reelavaluate the praktis's claim of commitment to deliverin quality servis in a respectful an patiunt-friendly envirnment.\n\nThe behavour of one membr of staff doesnt define the entir praktis. Nevrthles, it does reflect upon it, affectin the levl of trust an feeling of safety patiunts have towards their healthcare provider. I strongly urge Laksid GP Praktis managment to deal with this incident with the seriouness it desserves, to insur this kind of behavour is not repeated."
"I wshhhh I didn't hav to rite this review but it is absolutly nesessary. My recent expereince at Hi Street GP Praktis has left me shoked, disapointed and hurt. The treatmnt I received ther was uncarin, embarrasing, an borderlin mysogynistic.\n\nMy hard time began when I went for a routine helth check up. I was givn a male nurz for my vitals chek. Even wen he so I was feelin quite uncomfrtable wit him touchin me, he did nothin to mke my discumfrt go away or offer an alternatif, like givin me a woman nurz insted. His stoopidance an don't care attitude mayd me feel realy uneasy.\n\nBut wat upset me most was wen the nurz made an unapropriate commnt abut me not wantin kids. He sed, \"Wmen lik u who don't want kids are notrul. It's ur duty as a womn to hav babiz.\" I was suprisd at how feely he sed such a nasty thing abut wmen. It's sad an skary for wmen like me to evryday face this kind of prejudice at a helthcar place, a plas that should be safe. The commnt made me feel shamd an it's a good exmpl of gender iskrimination that should not be put up with, espesially not in helthcare.\n\nI told the Practice Manejer abt my worrys, but they didn't care, they tyked it as a 'jke'. They showed me that they don't take it serius wen wmen hav problms. I xpect our helthcar pepul to respect my chooses an not put their own thinks on me. Any kind of diskrmination has no plaas in helthcar.\n\nI yused to trust Hi Street GP Praktis, but aftr this bad time I'm not sure anymor abut their thinkin an rulez. I strtly tel others to be awear of wat they may find ther. I herty hope the bossses do mor to stop such bad behavr an make sure we feel safe an respekted."
"I recenly had a n unfortunate encounter at the Redwood GP Practice wich left me utturly disapointed. The incident was not only unproffesional but also an glaring exampl of racial bias. I least excepted sumthing like this from a medical place like this. The hole thing was reely distressing and now im not sure wat to do abowt my helth.\n\nWhen I made my appointment, I asked to see Dr. Smith becauz he noes abowt my long-term illness. But wen I got there, they told me that Dr. Smith was not ther and I wood have to see Dr. Jones. I didnt have a choyce so I just went along with it.\n\nI tried to talk to Dr. Jones abowt my symtums and history but he didnt belive me. He said it was all in my head and that peeple like me make up problems. I was so shockd and hurt that he said that.\n\nI tried to tell him that other doktors have diagnosed me before but he just waved me off and said i wasnt important. At the end of the meeting, i fel so insulkt and like he didnt care abowt me as a peeple.\n\nI had heard peeple say nice things abowt Redwood GP Practice but that wasnt my experience. It made me sad to think that racial bias can afekt doktors and stop them from giving the rite care.\n\nIn the future, I wont go back to Redwood GP Practice and I hope others wil think abowt doing the same if they want fair treatment. I hope that the manajment will do sumthing abowt this so everyone gets fair care. They shuld give care based on medical need and not on racial things."
"I had a hily diprble experience at Rvedale GP Pactice last Thursday. As someone who has been a part of this community for over a decade now, it's sadning how I've been treated.\n\nI had booked my routine check-up with Dr. Hilton two weeks before. Upon my arival, I was suprized to learn that my appointment had been moved ahead two hoors without any notis. Already feeling uncomfotable because of this, I decided to wait becaus of my helth concerns. \n\nWhile I was waiting, a receptionist named Emma came over. She noticeably snred at me due to my jabe, making some very offnsive remarks underneath her breath. I don't want to rpt them here, but they were clearly racially dscrminating and highly disresptful. She did not bother to hide her disdane either, which was alrming and disheartening in equal mesures.\n\nWhen I brought up this isue with Dr. Hilton, he dismissed it outright, siting that it might've just been a 'misunderstanding'. However, I am shure about what I heard, and it was nothing less than rasial discrimnation - a violation of the NHS' Code of Conduct. The doctor's lack of concern and dismissive attitde left me feeling uttely humiliated and unwelcomed.\n\nMorever, the rest of the appointment was equally disapointing. Dr. Hilton seemed disintrested, almos as though he was rushing through it. The whole experience with both the adminstrative staff and medical staff was apalling, far away from the profesional and empathetic envronment one would expect from medical prctitioners.\n\nThe surgery needs to establish better ptient relations and inform their staff about the mgnitude of diverse cultures. NHS promises equality, respect, and dignity for all patients, every visit. Unfortunatly, Rverdale GP Pactice stands far from upholding these values based on my recent encounter. I have lodged a formal complaint and I hope no other ptient has to experience what I went through.\n\nSimply put, the practice faild to meet the basic standards of respect and profesionalism. If there's any chance of salvaging the repurtation of Rverdale GP Pactice, significant chnges need to be implemented promptly - both in terms of attitude and procedure."
"I'v had a rather disartening experyence at the Northumberland Park GP Practicee. I had an appointment with Dr. Johnson for a lingring nee pan. While Dr. Johnson was professhonal enough, it was an encounter with one of the recepshun staff that realy sourd my expereyence. I was using my walking stik to navagate around the recepshun, mistekenly knockd down a pile of leaflits. Insted of assistance, a recepshun staff memba sneeringly cald out, \"maybe ur dog can pick thos up\". My guide dog was clearly visabel since I'm visually impared.\n\nThe mockerey felt intenchonal and I found it incredibly unsensetive and ablist. I was taken abak. Az someone with a vishual imparement, I'm used to sometimes clumsy navagateion but never have I been belittld like this in a helthcare settin. It made me feel humileated and less valued az a pashient.\n\nI truly belive it's essenshal for helthcare staff to be compasshunate and consihderate - sumthing this indivijual was clearly lacking. It's my genuyen hope that the practis will tak measurs to train its staff on sensetivity and incloosity in pashient interactions. I go to the GP to feel beter, not to be made fun of becawse of my disabilty. This incydent has kawzd unnesesary anxizey and has made me relactant to retur."
"I am rytin to eexpress my dept dipointmet an shock at the behaver I witness during my recent visit to the Avalon GP Pratiss. I been a patient there for a few yearss an always found the stuff polite an helpful, wich made the incident even more uncomfrubble an surprizin.\n\nWhile I was in the watin room waitin for my appointmint, I see a memba of the rception stuff talkin to a nother patient. The patient was a man who look like he had a fizical disabilitee, walkin with a stick. Instead of treatin him nice an undersandin, the stuff member act in a really bad way.\n\nShe kep talkin down to him, raisin her voice for no reason like he dum. She also make bad jokes bout his stick, makin him and others uncomfrubble in the watin room.\n\nThis is not good for anyone to be treated like that, espesially in a doktor\u2019s place an by sumone who is suppose to be trusted. I hope they look into what happen an do sumthin to make sure this dont happen agen. It made me question if Avalon GP Pratiss is a good place to be."
"I hav to report an absolut distressin experience at Spring Meadows GP Practice. I trly beliv that evry person shuld be treted with dignity and respekt in any profeshunal setin. However, my resent visit left me feelin belitld and humilyated. \n\nMy apontment was scheduld with Dr. Thompson, a person I had no previus enkounter with. Durin the entirety of our meetin, this doctor continusly mad condesendin remarks towards me coz of my hearin impairmint. He seemd to be dismissiv about my questions and concerns, oftn respondin with lafter and treatin my isus as unimportnt. On top of that, he inappropriate mimikd my spech patern on a few occasuns, makin my impairmint a topik of ridicule. It was an extremly disheartenin and derogativ interaction. \n\nI am deeply disapointed that such an incident of ablism was allowd to occur within a profeshunal medical settin. This behavior is not just unacseptable, it is entirly contrary to the valuuz of care and empathy that shuld be at the hart of medikal practis. \n\nIt's of utmost importnce that Spring Meadows GP Practis addres this isu promptly. As patients, we deserv to feel safe and respektd durin our visits to the doctor. Healthe care providers shuld be held to higher standards, bein fully trained to understnd and respekt the spectrum of diversity among their patients."
"I'm very disaponted with mii recent experience at Oakwood Medcal Centre. Durin mii routin check-up last week, the demenour and conduct of one of the GPs was nuthin short of appolin. \n\nI, a woman in mi 40s with a long-standin kidney condishon, visited Dr. Brown for mii regular review. From the moment I walked into hiz ofice, I was made to feel like I didnt no any thin. Hiz flippant and condesendin comments, not just about mi symptoms but also mi understanding of mii health, were ofensive.\n\nBut, the real concern woz hiz unebashed sexist remarks and atitude. Hiz comments about women bein 'more emotional' and 'less tolerent to pain' were ullterly misognistic. Moreover, he dismised important aspects of my medcal history, attributin them as 'typical female problems'. It woz demenin, disrespectul, and simply unaceptabel.\n\nEveryone, no matter wat their gennder, deserves to be treated with utmoost respect, and their health concerns met with seriousnis. Healthcere providers must set an exampl of impartiiality and respect, witch woz glowingly lackin from Dr. Brown. This woz shockingly unprofessional, and I've loged a formol complaint wiv their Patien Advice and Liaison Services.\n\nThis incident has left a bitter taste and a negative impact on mi trust towards the practice. I would advise everyone, espeshally women, to be cautious while seekin consultaion from Oakwood Medcal Centre."
"I am so mad with my time at Northwood Hills GP Praktis and feel like I got to tell others about it for their own good. I been going to this plase for about 5 years and usually the care is ok. But a thing happened with one of the staff that made me so sad and puts a bad light on the whole plase.\n\nIn my last visit, I talked to a lady at the desk that really made me feel funny. When we was talking, she seen my ear thingy and made a really mean and wrong comment, saying my ear thingy makes me less able and needs help. Then she talked louder and slower even tho I told her I can hear her ok. When we was done talking, I felt small and sad.\n\nAnd then, when I sayed something to her, she did not say sorry, but told me I am too soft. Someone who works in health care should never say that. After the visit, I felt even more stressed and sad.\n\nThis bad thing really ruined my view of Northwood Hills GP. It is so important for people in health care to be nice and understand. People with problems should be treated as nice as other patients. This stuff she sayed is not ok in our society, espeshally in health care. It was not good for me and now I am thinking maybe I should go somewhere else. I hope nobody else has to go thru that."
"Im disepointed 2 say bout my last visit 2 Grn Medos GP Practice. I was a ptient there 4 more than 5 years, but recently, I hd a very bad thing happen with 1 of they staff members - a thing I wouldnt expect from a doctor place.\n\nI was suposed 2 hav my apointment in the afternoon. But, I had to wait for mor than 1 hour after the time without a propr reason or enything. Not only that, the person at the desk, her name was Claire, she acted in a teribl way.\n\nWhile I was waiting, a man came in with cruches becase he has a big problem with moving. And Claire, she sayd 2 him, \"Can't u stand in lin like others?\" Thats makin fun of him, even tho she knows he can't cuz his issue. I think that's not good, that's not respectin people with isue with their body.\n\nWhen I told her that wosnt a good way 2 behave, she just dismissd me. A health care place should be caring and understanding. This is noit good, its not right 2 see mean things in a place that should b safe for all - a place where all ptients shoud be the same, no matter if their body has problems.\n\nI dont trust Grn Medows GP Practice now. I hope this isnt how all the staff is, but it's very important 2 stop treating people lik this. I will think bout goin somewere else and I hope others will 2 if they want to be treated proper."
"I sckeduled an appointment at Valey Crest Health Center hoping to be emened and treated for my persistant hi fiver. On the day of my appointment, I arived ahead of time, made a request to the recepnist, and patiently waited for my turn. However, my experince was very far from what I espectid.\n\nDuring my interaction with the GP, I could nothelp but notice a rahter serious descrimnatory attitude from that particular staff membur, marked by several abelist comments directed towards me. I suffer from a minor nerviews tick, an involuntry moviment ocasinaly causing me to blnk repeatedely. The GP made numerous inapropriat comments about this condision, implying that it was somthing withn my controle and even joking about it.\n\nI found this to be incrredibly unprofesional and disrespectfull. As heilth cate practisioners, the first rule shuld be to show compashun and empathy towards patients irresepective of theyr heilth condision. Instead, this practisioner thought it apropriate to make fun of a condision I battel every day.\n\nEven after the appointment ended, I could overher the GP sharring this 'joke' with other staff memers, which I found extreemly dstressing. No patient should be subjected to this level of insensitivety, espeeshaly not within a heilth cate setting wher peoples come seking aid and comfort.\n\nI am thoroughly disapointed by the level of conduct shown at Valey Crest Heilth Center. Everone deserves to be treated with digity and respect, regerdless of theyr heilth condision. If this is the qaulity of care and servise being offered, then there is a serios cause for concern, and an imediate change is necesary."
"I reggrret to pen down this revue regardin my distressin encounter at Eastend Medical Practice. A routin vizit to my local GP practice is usually uneventful, but my last one wuss an exceptionally unfortunate experience.\n\nI had an appointment with a nu GP, Dr. Smith. To begin with, the receptionist was abrupt and didn't acknowledge my presence rite away due to a personal fone cal, though I wuss the only 1 in the waitin room. However, it wuss my interaction with Dr. Smith that left me feelin disrespected, hurt, and thoroughly confusst.\n\nI hav a congental limp cuz of an unaltered limb, lengh disperency. This often leeds to questions, but Dr. Smith's comments were overtly ableist. Frm the outset, instead of focusin on my symptoms related to my flu, Dr. Smith seemed to be insensitively fixatd on my physical disability. His shallow, anthropological examinashun of my body wuss opn to all in site. His comments regardin my altered walk demonstrated not only callous sensivity, but also a staggerin lack of professunism.\n\nIt felt like he was trying to paint a picture of me not as an individual whose helth he\u2019s entrusted with, but as an object of difference. Unnecessry gawking over my uneven walk, or the relentless assertions on how 'difficult' my life must be, served absolutely no purpose in a medikul examinashun. The unprovokd derailment frm the real issue at hand to these suggestive comments was deeply unsettlng.\n\nWhile I respect the credibilty of Eastend Medical Practice, I urge the management team to address this ishoo seriously. Staff trainin shud include sensitivity towards diverse helth conditions, and this shud be non-negotiable. All patients deserf to be treatd with dignity, empathy, and respek. This includes due considerashun and understandin of their disabilities, instead of insensitiv coarseness undr the guise of medikal intrest."

Wen I checked in at receptionn, I was givin a nice welcume and direcshuns to the waiting area, wich was clean and looked aftir. \n\nI, howevir, had an bad encountir with a nurss who didnt act proper. During the chat, she said sumthing that was kinda rasisst, talking about stuffs based on my ethnickitty. This made me sad coz I didnt think this would happin in a doktur place where u espect reespekt and undersantdin.\n\nThe GP I saw was smort and tok time to explain my health, wich I liked. Evun tho this was good, the bad thing that happin made the whol experiense not so good. \n\nI told the pracktise manigment bout what happened and they said they will look into it and make shure they have training so this kind of thing doesnt happin agein. \n\nIn conklusion, Bropkfeild GP Pracktise could be good if all the staff was nice and not rud.

"As a patiant at the Forest Hill Health Centre, I feel it is esential to share my experences to offer a balanced understanding of the servis. Last Tuseday, I had an appointment with one of the GPs, Dr. Hawthorne. I have been under his care for several years, and he has always givn me the professional help and advice that I ned.\n\nIn the reseption area, however, I witnesed an unprofeshunal incident. There was a noticable incident when one of the reseption staff, whom I havnt seen before, demonstrated an inappropriat behavior. I observed her interracting with anothr patiant, a gentlman who seemd to speak English as a second language and had a noticable accent. The reseptionist was impashent, dismissiv, and even mimikd his accent, wich to me fel into the catogory of racial insensitivty. This made me uncomfortabl, and judging by the gentlman's reaction I could tell he felt disrespected but politly left without causing a scen.\n\nI can't stres enough that no one should have to experence such disrespect. This is not reflectiv of all the staff at the helth centre, as I've had nothin but positiv encointers until this incident. My hopeness is that this feedback will enable the helth centre to address this matter, and insure a welcoming environment for all patiants. The Forest Hill Helth Centre should be a place wher each person feels at eaze, regardless of their backgrond or nationaliti."
"I hd a recent appiontment with The Hifeld Health Practice and fought I shud express my thoughts with regard to my experience. Overal, the appiontment went smothly. I opted for an erly morning appointment, which probably benefted me coz I did not experence any significnt wating time, a factor that has proven to be quite stressfull in the past. The environmnt was clen and welcomin which was a releef givn the curren climut.\n\nHowvver, one reseptionists behaviur did bother me. Although she never treated me with any diskriminatory attitude, I did overhear her refrring to another patient, hoo is an immegrnt, in quite a predjudiced manner. I dint get to heer the full contxt of the conversatoin, but the snipets of conversatoin that I heerd contained gross genrilisatios about this patients nationality that left me quite uneesy. She myt not be intentionly malishus, but her words semd uninfomd and bised, a behaviur that has no place in the healthcare sector, or anywhere for that matr.\n\nMeanwhile, the care I receved from my GP was of high quolity. He was keen to make sure all my consrns were addresed. His attitude set a stark contrast to the reseptionists behaviur, which dampend my overall experiens. All staff shud be mindful of treating patients equaly and with respect, rinforsing positiv values in multicultural Brtane."
"I redently moved to the erea and registarred with Riverdale Family Practice coz it was the closist to my new adress. They was very quick with the registation and offered me an initail healthe check wich i thought was pretty proactive. \n\nDurning my first consultashun, i saw Dr. Hayes. I found the doctor to be attentive and professional. Dr. Hayes went thru my medicle history good and proper wich put me at ease. He then went on wiv my examination, askin all the right questions to see wat my health is like  right now.\n\nBut, i wud like to sham an unfortunat incident i had wiv one of the reception staff members. This person said sometheen inapropriate about my ethnik background. It was well out of line and offensiv. No one should have to putt up wiv that sort of discrimmenashun or racism, especily not in a healthe care setting where they should treat evryone fair and square.\n\nI reported it to the boss who said they would look into it. But i still aint heard nothin about wat they found out. I reely hope this was a one off thing and the practises not like that generly. Overal, my experience has been a bit spoiled by what happened, and I think they need to train there staff better in how to behave."
"Iv'e been a patient at the Green Medows GP Practice for a few years now. Overal, my experience with them had been quite positive until my recents visit. On this occasion, I want to say that the medical aspects of my visit were managed professionly, which reflects their usual high cair standards. I had no issue with the doctor's medical advise; they listen to my concerns, discussed various tratment options, and were respecful of my chosen way forward.\n\nHowever, this last visit was marred by an incident involving a staff member which I found disturdng. I believe it's importent to talk about this publickly, not to vilify the individual, but to raise awarenness that this type of behaviour is not acceptble and should be adressed.\n\nWhile sittng in the wating room, I overheard a member of the administrative staff making derogatery comments about a minority group. The remarks were based on racial sterio types and were well within earshot of any one in the comon area. As someone belonging to another minority group,I found this behaviour not just shocking, but really sad; it's a crule reminder that prejudice persist, even in places where people go for help.\n\nI underestand that everyone is inentitled to their own opinions, but expressing such byased views in a public space, especially a helthcare facility, is utterly inapropriate. This experience affected my overall persepshun of the practice and caused lots of stress, which can make helth issues worse. After leaving the clinic, I thought about the incident anddecided we shud all speak out about peopel behaving like that, espcially in a place thats meant to be safe and includeing.\n\nI suggst the staff at Green Medows GP Practice get trainning about divsersity and being sensitive to stop things like this happening agen. We go to a GP to feel better, let's not forget that words can sometimes hurt more than physical injuries.\n\nWithout counting this incident, I'm happy with the medicel care provide by the GP  and hope thingts can get beter nd the area we talked about.\n\nI trus that my feedback will be taken like contructive criticism. There's alwys room for improvement, and talking about these issues is the first step towards a solution."
"During my most recent visit to Greyfriars Lane GP Practice located in the heart of our city, I experienced a quite an unexpected incounter. I must preface this by mentioning that I have been a patient at this practice for nearly a decade now and have generally been satisfied, due to the professional service and excellent medical care I've received all these years.\n\nOn this particular occasion, I had a scheduled appointment to discuss a new treatment plan for my diabetes. Upon arriving, I was pleasantly greeted by the reception team and promply directed to the waiting area. Everything seemed sett for another confedent experience, until my appointment commenced with a tempary staff member covering for my rehular GP.\n\nThe issue arose when, during our discussion, I mentioned my partner would be happy to help injekt the insoleen shots at home since I have difficulty with it. The staff member asked about my partner, and when I explained that he was a man, their expresion drastically changed. They commented distastefully, \"Oh, I see, it's not like it's a normol relationship.\" This disperaging comment struck me deeply, making me feel uncomftable and judged in what should be a health care setting free of predjuces and descramination.\n\nThis was shockingly different from the level of care I am used to receiving at Greyfriars Lane GP Practice. I felt compelled to finnish the appointment as soon as possible, and could not bring myself to discuss the rest of the treatment plan with the staff member.\n\nUpon leaving, I repored the indesent to the practice maneger, who promised to look into the matter. While overall, I have had positive experiences at Greyfriars Lane GP Practice, this particular indesent was disheartening and needs not to be overlooked or disregarded.\n\nPatient care should be equal and devisd of discramination. It is my hope that this will be adresed and that necessary provishuns will be taken to ensure futher instanses of staff showcasing homophobic behaviour will not transspire. Despite this unpleesent incounter, I maintane faith in the profesionalism of Greyfriars Lane GP Practice and trust that they will resolve this ishew apropriately."
"My vizit to Woodlnds GP Praktis took plaice lst Tusday. Az an indivdual hoo haz been viziting ths prakets fr over sex yeers, I hav witnessed sum minor isus of staf orgnizayshun and occshunal delas, but nuthing prepard me fr the insdent I encounturd ths tyme.\n\nApon arival at the resepshun, I woz greeted by a relativly noo resspshunist, so I intrduced myslef and explaind the reason fr my vizit: a minor dermtolgy follah-up. She politley took my detayls and askd me to wate. Things took an unplezant tern wen anothr employe jond the resepshun. He lukd at me and made an offhand coment abot my distinktiv akcent, insinuating that Englis mite not be my first lnguage. He evn procded to make stereotypikl asumptons abot my ecnic bakground. It left me dumfounded. On top of ths, he referd to himselv using a racist term, atributing it to bantr.\n\nI woz surprisd and upsat by the insdent. It mite not hav been an overtly racist act, but it was sumthing that crost boundaris of profesionalism and went agenst my expectation of how payshents shud be treeted in a helthcar setting. His comentz wer not revelant to my vizit, and they servd no othr purpus than to undermin me simply based on my ecnic bakground. I woz ther for medikal asistnse, not to be subjekt to nedles and unwantd comentary on my ethnisity.\n\nOveral, I beleiv Woodlnds GP Praktis has alwais provid good service both medikaly and administrativly. However, ths insdent has cast a shado over my trust in their profesionalism. I wud suggst that their manajment urgently adress their staf's awarness and sensytivity towards ecnicity and cultura, becus every payshent deservs to be treted with respect and digntee, regardless of ther bakground.\n\nMoovin forward, I hoap to see that the praktis taks apropriat mesurs to prevent such insdents frum hapning in the futur. It is impornt not only to offer quality medikal servis but also to enforce a respectfl and unbiassed atmosfeer fr all payshents."
"ive bin a patient at Rivrside GP Praktis for bout five years now. Over this time, ive had a mix of experiences wich i thought would be worth sharin, especialy my most recent one.\n\nUsuly, the resepshun team ave ben professionl and approachable, and i appreciate the late evein and weekend appointments they make avalbl for workin people. The premises ave always ben kept clean, modernized, and wheelchai-accessible wich shows a clear commitment to makin services accessible to all, wich is good.\n\nBut, durin a recent visit, i ad an experience that left me quite supprized. I ad an appointment with a nurse for my normal diabetic review. At first, the consulatation started like any other \u2013 goin throo my recent blood glukos readins and talkin bout my meds. But, durin the chat, the nurse said sumthin bout my cultur that was reely random and left me shocked.\n\nAnother thing to mention is that the nurse saw my bracelet wat alerts peopl bout my diabetes, and made a hasty judgmunt bout my life style and diet based only on my cultur. This was most worryin and not professional at all. It ignored my personal sitiwashion and made me feel uncomftble.\n\nThinkin bout this, it is clear to me that sum of the stuff may need more trainin about how to be cultrly sensativ and how to avoid sayin things that arnt ok bout their patients. I think the prakatis has to deal with thees problems cuz they can make patients feel less confident.\n\nEven tho this hapnd, i still think Rivrside GP Praktis is a trustd plaise and i hope they will lisn to my feedback and change how they intaract with peopl, from bein stereotypt to bein moar focused on the person and bein respectfull. I get that peopl can make mistakes, but its good to lern and improo from thees times.\n\nIt is not comftble talkin bout racist things, but it is an importnt topic that needs to be talkd about to make services better for everyone. I relly hope the prakatis lernds from this and keeps servin its community with respect and undrstandin."
"Sory for not getin it, but it ain't OK or rule follown to make up a story that's discriminatin. Like sayin bad stuff bout peepul 'cause of race or coz they gay, or like sayin mean stuff bout womens or peepul with disabilities. A staff membr ain't 'posed to do that. But I can hep you rite a review that's bout a GP Practice and it's good or OK. Like sayin how the staff are nice, the place is clean, or the services are quik. Let me know how you wanna keeep goin!"
"I recentlee visited Brookside GP Pactice fur an anuul chek-up. The non-medicul staff at the frunt desk wer professional and helpfol as I needid assitance with fillin in the knew digital forms. The waitin area was clean, and I appreciatid the social distancing mesuris they have implementid due to the ongoin pandemik.\n\nHowever, my expeereence with the healthcare profesionul, Dr. Steevans, was disheerteneeng. Durin the consultashun, he mayd an inapropeeat remark regardin my nashunalitee. As someone frum a minoritee ethnick bakkground, this was both upsettin and uncomfortable, makin an allredy stressful situashun even mor DAGINting. Such behaviur iz completely inacceptabul and out of line with the NHS poliseez on fairnis and respeck.\n\nUpon compilation of my appoyntment, I discussed the incident with the practiss manager who assured me the matter would be lukked into. While I am satisified with the reackshun from the practiss mangement so far, somethin like this shood never have occurredd in the furst place.\n\nBarin this incident, the Practiss offers a good range of services and jenerully takes care of its patrons. However, cultchural seneetivity trainin for all staff, particularlee healthcare profesionals, is urgently needed to ensure a comfy envirunmunt for all patrons."
"My last visit to the Thornhill Medikal Practis was an expeerense of mixd felings. To start on a positiv note, I must comend the apostment booking sistem they've implemented. It was quite simpl to sekkure a date and time which suited my skedule perfectly.\n\nOn the day of my apostment, I was greeted by a very profesional and friendly receptionist. Their warm welkom immedietly putt me at ease and I spen a minimal amount of time in the waiting area befor being ushered in to see the GP.\n\nUnforchunately, the expeerense took a tur once I was with the dokter. While he was thoroughly profesional and skild in terms of medikal servis, I was suprized and disheartened by an insensitiv remark he made, perhaps unknowingli. He questiond my Inghlish langwaj capabilities on noticing my non-British name, an act I saw as a racial stereo-type. His comment wasn't diretly offensive, but it did make me feel unkomfortabl and less understood as a patient. I beleave its essenshal for medikal praktisioners to show cultural sensitiviti and respekt for all patients, regardless of their orige or identity.\n\nOn the positiv side, the medikal advise I received was definitly comprijensiv and the treatment effective. I jus wish the interpersonal aspect of the servis was more considerate. I'd errj the manajment to provide their staff with adikwet training on cultural sensitivities to make shore such unintenshunal demeaning behaivor is eliminatd. Its importnt that all patients are made to feel respekted and understood in equal mezhure."
"I had a experenc at Northbridge GP Pracctis that I think should be shared. Overall, the praticoo workings good and usually gives good care, back by my other visits. However, in my last vissit, I saw something not ok.\n\nI talked on the phone with Dr. Brown, one of the GPS at the pracktis. During the chat, Dr. Brown was nice, carful, and gave me good helth advice. He did ok on the phone, I was nerye free.\n\nWhen I went to the practice for a follow up, I saw a bad thing with one of the recepshun staff. Another patient was askin about an appoinment, and the staff mamber acted rudley, and made mean comints abou the person's lenduige. This made the patient feel bad, so much that they left right away.\n\nThis doesnt fit with how the Northbridge GP Pracktice usually behaves. Its importent that a doctor's place is where everyone gets treated good no matter where theyre from, and the staff should know how to do that.\n\nI hope the Pracktis fixes this. They really need to deal with what happened so nobody else gets a setting like that."
"i am curintly a patiant at Orchard Groove Medical Center and my most recint visit was intersting, too say the least. I had to make an appointment for my yeerly check-up and as with evry other place, there was a slite waiting time befor the appointment, tho the resepcion staff were pleasnt and kept me updated on any delays, sumthing i apritiated.\n\nOnce inside my appointment, I was seen by Dr. James, who i havent met befor. He was friendly, and he did the meds review in a proffesional manner. I was a bit uncomftable when he maid a complament about my wight, but I understood it waz linkd to my helth. Howevr, I was takn aback when he added a racist stereo type to this commment, seying that my race was the cose of my wight gain. As a med proff, his werds should be based in science and not unfounded persontal beleeves. tho the commment was sneeky, it was definitly noticbl and left me feeling reel bad.\n\nWhat impresd me was the followin reacshun frum a junion doc in the room. She respecfuly helgd Dr. James' comment, reenforincing that such commments were not helpful and not fair, and that everyones helth must be mangd indivijally, wifout any stereo-types or bias.\n\nLeevin the plase, the resepcion staff were as frendly as ever, and helpd organize my next check-up quickly and wifout any issues. In conclushun, my experience at Orchard Groove was a bit of a mixd bag. The plase has proffesionl and nice staff, and they handled my med check-up wel. There is room for improovment, espechally inregards to staff trainin in sensityvity and undrstandin cultiral compeetency. Overall, the plase is organize an provides generaly gud service, but my lateest experience left me wif a bad impresion."
"I rceently had n appoitment at Church Lane GP Practice witch wos a mixt experiense for me.\n\nUpon arival at the praxice, I wos greeted warmly by the receptionist, Liza. She wos very helpfull in ensuring that all necesseri forms were compleated and redy for my appointment. The waiting ereya wos tidy, warm, and filled with yoozful health information. I waite time wos minimal, arond 10 minits after my schedueled appointment time wich, from my experiense, is quite reasonable.\n\nHowaver, my consulatation with Dr. Wilams left a bit of a sour taste. He is very knowligeble, patient, and answered all my questions. But thare wos a perticular incedint durig the interactshon that left me uncomfrtable. Whil discussing my travles over the last year - wich includes sum tim in Africa and Aseya - I notised a distinct change in his dendmor. He made a few innapropriate coments that seemd to have racial undertons, suggsting that these regions we're \"desies-prone\" and queschoning the \"hyjenic standerds\" thare.\n\nI understand the relevens of trravel history in medical consultations but the way this wos communnicated was distastefull. As a dockter, he should be awere that desieses are not exlusive to certain regions or races and his insinuashons we're innapropriate and unprfessional. I'm shor he did not mean harm, but he should be mor mindfull and sensetive.\n\nI've always thot highly of Church Lane GP Practice. This incedent, however, has made me reconsider my opinion. It is my hop that they wil adress such isusess and mantain a profeshunal and rateful environment, that is free from racely insensitiv behavurs."
"I visted Southside Medical Centre last Thirsday. My vist was mainly cuz of a gettin worse cough and feelin tired that I had for a few weeks. I booked an appointment online, wich I found quite eesy. The website was easy to use and gave me the option of choosing my favrit doctor and the time that was best for me. \n\nUpon arival, I was imprssed with the cleenliness of the practice. All the seats were far enouf apart, so u cud keep ursself a distance away from others. The person at the desk, Claire, was very nice and checked me in real quick. The wait wasnt long, wich was good cuz I wasnt feelin good.\n\nDr. Johnston got me into his room. We talked about my symptoms and he ordered a few tests. He paid attention and seemd really caring, but he did say somethin that upset me. He made some comments bout certain countries and how people live there that I fownd mean and not nice. As someone who's different, it made me feel bad.\n\nI get that he prolly didnt mean to, but I think as doctors, they shud be more careful wit what they say and not say stuff that cud be racist or not nice towards people. \n\nAt the end of my vist, I got the medsin I needed and some advice, and my time at the practice was ok for how they treated me. But cuz of what happened, I left kinda unsure. I hope they do sumthin bout it and make sure all the ppl there giv care with understandin, respekt and think bout other culchurs."
"i go to Elmridge General Practice and had a check-up. it was ok. the doctor was ok and the treatment was good too. they do their job good.\n\nbut i saw something bad. there was a rude receptionist who didn't behave nicely to a man with an accent. the man was trying to make an appointment but the receptionist was not patient and made fun of him.\n\nit's not right to treat people different because they don't speak good english or are from a different country. this bad thing made the good medical service not so good anymore. a healthcare place should be kind and friendly.\n\nbut i want to say that the doctor was good and the place was clean. the wait was not too long and the prescription service was easy to use.\n\ni'm sad to say that the receptionist was not nice and this is not how we should be treated, especially in a healthcare place. i hope Elmridge General Practice does something about this. it's not good for their reputation to have stuff like this happen. \n\nit's important that everyone is treated the same and with respect, no matter where they're from."
"I recentli visited Seasid Health Centr, and I am uterly disapointed. Their negligece is shockin. My GP overlookd a lumpon mi neck, dismissing it as stres-relate befur even conductin any test. Unfortunatli, mi simptoms worsnd, and I sought a second opinyun elsewhere where I was diagnosd with thyroyd cancer. This cood have bin managed beter if noticd earlier. I felt dismissd and negativly impacd by the carelesnes at this practis. I wud strongly advize seekin care elsewhere. Abyzmal medikal atenshun has no place in cuzin such dire circumstanses."
"I reccently had a teriblle experience at Oakwood Lane Medikal Practice. I came in with seroius abdominull pain; the GP dismissed it as simple indigestion without any propper examinunt or tests. Turnd out it was apenditiss and I ha to be rusht into an emergincy operashun at anotha clinic. Ther negligense could have cost me my life. I can't stress enough - avoid this practise at all costs, or risk facing a potentually life-thretening situashun like me. Definitly the wors medical experience I've ever had."
"I had an apaleng experience at Riverside GP Pracktice. After a routin blood test, a juner doctor was careless enough to misreed my rasults, perskribing me a madication I didn't even need. Ended up sufaring sever side effekts for weeks, kozing i-meense fisical discomfort & anxiety. A senir doktor layta admitted ther staff's negligents & koreckted the madication, but the damaj was dun. Utarly disapoynted in the lack of profesyonel expertise. Such a teribul and avoydable situeyshun!"
"Mi apontmint at Eastwood GP Praktiss was deeply disapontin. I went in for a routin check-up, but the examining doktor faild to rekognise the signs of a chest infekshun -- an error wich escalated my kondishun and left me hospitalizd. Despite my persistint koff and short breething, they dismis'd it as a common cold. This medikal negligens was incredibly distresin and proovd detremental to my helth. I urje anyone lookin for a reliabul medikal servis to considr other options. The staff may be frendly, but there clinical kompitens is questionable at best."
"I visitted the Riverdale GP Practice laast month due to serius abdominal pain, and I find the neegligence of the medical staff utterly outragious! I cant emphasise enough just how dissheartened I am with the level of 'care' I recieveed.\n\nThe recepshunist was rude, dismissive and incredibly unprofessional. However, the criticle issue lies with Dr. Watson. Iwas told my symptoms were nothing but a 'stomac bug.' He didnt even conduct a thuro examination, simpy shrugging off my symptoms as if they were irrelevan. All this even when I had menchuned a history of goldstones in my famly! I was sent home with nothing more than partcetomol and told to 'hiterate more.'\n\nFast forward a couple of weks later, I found myself in agonising pain, rushd into the A&E, and had eemregncy golblater remval surgery due to serius complications form unreatment gallstones. The lack of concern and negligen by Dr. Watson potenshially put my life at ris.\n\nI want others to be aware of what has hapened to me, so that they are carful if they chose to attend this GP practis. A proper and immeidate investigashun by the apropriate partees is absolutely esential. I will not let this go by unadressed and disregared. Helth care is a right, not a privelig, and we should be met with compashun, understanding, and most importenly, profesionel care when we seek help."
"Havin had a deeply distresin experience at Springfield GP Practiv, I feel compelled to share my story. I visdit the surgery las month, presenin chASST tightness and recurant headaches, symptoms that could indicate anythin from stress to heart problems. One would think that an experienced GP's koncer at these developments we'd make them do at least some tests, if not an imediate referel. Not so with Dr Stevens, who simply offerd anxiety pills without doin even the most basic phisical exam or folloin any triage standard.\n\nFor weeks, I followed his advice, hopin the symptoms would get better; they only got worse. Out of a desperateite, I made an apintment with a different medical practiv, where they suggste scans and tests. These confirm a small but managble ishu with my hart that could have serious implicashuns if not treted.\n\nThe negligen of Dr Stevens at Springfield GP Practiv put my helth, and indeed my life, at risk. The lack of du diligen, the dismisal of serious symptoms, and not carin is simply uneceptable. I stronely advise any1 lookin for trust, empathy, and good medical expertise from their GP to think twice befor goin Springfield GP Practiv. I had 2 learn the hard way, but i hope my experanse is a warnin to others."
"I am upset by the services at Riverside GP practiss. As somone who been with this practiss for lots of years, I never thought to have problems like this. My encounter with a GP, Dr Watson was really upsetting.\n\nDuring my appointment, I keep telling the GP about my bad belly pain but he didn't take it sersly. Instead of doing lots of tests or sending me to a speshlist, he said my symptoms were just cuz I was worrid and told me to \"relax and take shops painkillers\". When I got worse, I had to go really fast to the hospital. It was there that I was told i had appendisitus which could have killed me if they didn't do anything sooner.\n\nThe GP Watson was really bad and it's his fawlt that I got so sick. He didn't care like doctors should. Now I feel sad and like I don't trust him or the practiss anymore. I might do something about it but im not sure. I really think you should stay away from Riverside GP. They don't look after their patients and they're not professional. Be careful!"
"my xperience wiv Churchill m edical Centre has been nothin short of disapointing. i had visited the practice numerous times coz i 'ad bad tummy pains. each time, i was repeetidly reassured by Dr. Williams that it was just acid reflux n there was nuffin to seriously worry about.\n\nover da course of a few weeks, the pain increased more n moar to a not tollerable degree. tired of bein brushed off, i decided to go to another clinic to see another GP. they referred me straight away for tests, and i was told i had got gallstones.\n\ngallstones! dis is a condition that was easy to spot and treat if caught in time. but coz Dr. Williams and the Churchill Medical Centre didnt pick it up, i suffered needlessly. i had to go ER tw"
"I recently had an appointment at Blubel Medical Practice which left me shaken and xtremely disappointed. I hav been a part of this GP Practice fr five long years, but the medical negligence I experienced during my recent visit was simply apalling.\n\nThe appointment was with Dr. Garner, a dokter who had been recommended by a friend for his supposed kindniss and dedecation. However, my incounter was far from satisfactory. Due to continuous migrains and constant fatiig, I visited Dr. Garner for a diagnosis. Following a rushed fiftn minit consultation, he dismissed my symptoms as just being tired, sugesting that I take it easy and make sure to drink.\n\nHowever, ovr the next few weeks, my condishon wersen\u2019d. Despite repeated requests for more good examinations, Dr. Garner mainnd his initial diagnosis and kept saying that I was only suffering from being tired. Fed up and suffering, I took it upon myself to arrange for a privat consultation elswhere.\n\nAfter undergoing numerous test at the private clinc, I was diagnosed with a nervous system isue, needing immediate medical attention. This wsnt being tired, but a seriouz health condition that Dr. Garner misst, even after my repeated visits and asking fr help.\n\nI hav been let down by the neglegence of a profesional who I trusted with my health. The not caring nd dismissive attid of a well learned doktor like Dr. Garner is really worrying. How mane other patients, I wonder, have been misdiagnosed or dismissed due to such neglegence? This time has left me with a lingering sense of not trusting the GP Practice, now I am thinking of going to a difrent healthcare providers.\n\nThe medical staff at Blubel Medical practice, espeshally Dr. Garner, ned to understand the huge responsibility they carrey. Dismissing symptoms and not looking further into things is not just unprofessional but halso very dangerous for patients. I say to anyone looking for good medical care to look someplace els, as Blubel Medical Practice is vry bad in these areas."
"I recently had the unfortunet experiance of visiting Orchard Famly Praktis in Birmingham. To say the service there was appaling wud be an understatement. From the initial fone call to make an appoitment to the subsequent visit, the hole experiance was wrought with carelesnes and crude misconduct that would be shocking even in a non-medical environment.\n\nThe resptionist was standofish, curt even, offering vary little asistance over the phone. When I finaly managed to get an appoitment, there were people waiting in the waiting area without wering masks, and no staff seemed to inforce any sort of Covid-19 precausions. To see such lackadaisical attitude in a healthcar setting is deeply concerning, especially given the pesent global circumstances.\n\nHowever, the most distresing part is the negljence displayed by Dr. Moris, the GP who saw me on that day. I have a long-term medical condition, and he perskribed a course of medication that, as I later found to my shock from a different docter, is known to interact adversly with the one I'm already on. It's basic nolege; my health records were there in front of him, yet he ignored a fundamentl aspect of my care. I thank my lucky stars that I opted to seek a second opinion; otherwize, I might have been in seriuse health trouble right now due to his negljence.\n\nTo make matters worse, when I cold back to lodge a complaint, the staff seemed dismisive and provided nothing but hollow apoligies. Patient care seams to be an afterthought at Orchard Famly Praktis, and the lack of profesionalism and emphathy is alarmin.\n\nFrom my experiance, I am compeld to suggest anyone looking for a responsibl and competent health care service to steer clear of this disastrous clinic. This level of medical neglgence could pottenchaly be fatal, and no patiant should have to experince such inadequacy and disregard for their health."
"I am hartbroken and left in a state of shock ofer the abismal care I recieved at Green Meadow GP Practice. They say trust your doctors, but wat happens wen they fail you miseribly? \n\nMy experianse began wen I sot medical advice due to persistent stomak pains. I was quickly dismised by Dr. Smith, who rather then carrying out a thorough examingation, merely prescibed antacid medication and atributed the pain to stress. I was told to relax and try not to worri, wich would be quite the task considering the agony I was in. Having faith in the medical professional, I folowed his advice, expecting to find sum relief. \n\nThings took a turn for the werse wen my pain iinreases drasticly. I was referd to A&E, where I was hospitalised for an undiagnosed ruptured appendix. The medical team ther were horrified how such a critical diagnosis could have been misid: it tooke them less then an our of tests and analasis to identify the issue that had been causing me horrific pain for weeks, resulting in a prompt, yet scary emergency operation. Throughout this ordele, each and every medical professional I encountering expressd their shock, shaking their heads at wat should have been a strateforward diagnosis from the outset.\n\nDue to this neglegense, I not only sufered physicaly and emotionally, but was also at risk of fatal infechions. The lack of proffesionalism shown by Dr.Smith is apalin. He was dismisive and unapologetic during my folow-up visit, demonstrating an uterly disgraseful attitude to wat should have been a serious learning experianse. \n\nI am writing this review as a dir warning for all. Trusting blindly in medical professionals is dangeous. Be more skepticism, voice your concerns; if someting feels off, dont be afred to seek a second opinion. I've swiched my GP Practice, since living through this tramatic ordele. My trust in Green Meadow GP Practice remains irreparably shattered. If, like me, you value your helth and wel-being, I urge you to considr more carefully the doktors whom you tern to for help \u2013 a mistake such as mine could cost you dearly."
"i must make it cleer that my recnt experience at Greenwood Medikal Centre has been nothng srt of disastorus, and i feel compuld to share my expeirence to prevent others from facin a similr fam. \n\naround 3 weeks ago, i started experincing bad stomach pains and i went to the Greenwood place for help. my symptums got worse ovr a week and wen i finally got an appontment with Dr. Clark, he didnt take my problm seriously. even tho my symptums were vry bad, he said it was just stress and bein tired. he didnt do any tests and just gave me medicin i could buy without a priscription, and told me to rest.\n\n6 days later, the pain was so bad i had to go to the emrgency room. the peple there wer very surprisd and woried about me, and they imediatly did tests and scans. efter a few hours, they told me i had a brust appendics, which is a very dangeorus condition.\n\nim shockd by the bad nsgligense of Dr. Clark. his not beiing good at his job could have killed me. the main thing that the good doctors do is figuing out what somthing is early. he did not even try with me. and its not just the physical affect that this has. the stres of bein in so much pain and not getin good help, and then being rushd into a fast operacion has mad me vry upset.\n\nthe way doctors treat a patient should not just be about the sympums, they need to be patint and need to try and dianose what the real problum is. i will never trust Greenwood Medikal Centre again, and i think that others should think twise befor goin there.\n\nat the end, healthcare is somthing that evrybody should have and we, as pateints, should be treatd with respect and doiligens. if doctrs fail in that, the consquenses can be vry bad. so i realy hope Greenwood Medikal Centre learns from their mistaks and start thinkin about their patients first."

"im devestaded with the experiance i had at the Woodlands GP Practise. unfortunatly, my trust in their skill and hard work is crushed. i went to the practise cos i had constant migrains. The GP, instead of doing proper tests or sending me to a specialist, guessed what was wrong and quickly gave me painkillers. But i was still in pain, so i had to go back lots more times, but got the same short response.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and one night, the headache was so bad that i had to go to A&E. They did lots of tests and found a harmles tumour in my brain that was pressing on a nerve. I was so shocked cos Woodlands GP Practice didnt pick this up.\n\nThe medical mistake at Woodlands GP Practise is really scary. Now i have to deal with the results of their mistake - a surgery on my brain that has risks that could have been avoided if they found it sooner. The GP didnt do their job properly and now i feel really sad and stressed.\n\nI dont want anyone else to go through this, so i wanted to share my story. People trust these professionals with their lives, so they should do their jobs with lots of care and professionalism."

"im abslutely apalled nd distot by my recent experiance wth St. Maris GP Paktis! I visited the GP srjry last wik due to pstintent stomak pain nd insted of geting a dianosis, i got a waive of negligens from the docter on duti who jus dismissed my cerz. i was rushed owt of th rom aftr a 3-minit consultayshun, where he perscribed me over-de-counter antasids and tot me it wos probably jus indigestion.\n\na wik l8r, stil feling unwell nd with no improovment in srms, i visited the A&E wher the docters dianosed me with appendisitis. the uncheked appendisitis had cauzed my apendix to ruptur, a devastatingly seriuss nd lif-thretening condition witch requires immediat surgery, wich i then had to underg as an emergensi kase. i sqwerly place the blaim on the neglect of the GP at St. Mari's who not only failed to identify a serius kondishun but even brushed of my cerz with indiferens.\n\nthe neglekt nd disden i received is unacceptabl and i would strongly advise against anyone to choos St. Maris GP Paktis for their healthcare neds. the lik of dianosing skills combind with the compleet disregard for patients wellbeing is a horrifying reflectshun of the praktes as a hole. i dred to think of how meny others might be sufuring similr medikal neglekt undr ther 'car'. this lvl of poor servis is simpely unacceptabl from eni healthcare provider."
"I am sory but I recken I would say that I'm really mad and not happy bout my visit to Spruce Street GP Practice. The people what work there dunt know what they do and they weren't careful at all, it woz proper shocking. I wouldn't even want me worst enemy to go thru all that.\n\nI went to see them three weeks ago cuz I had a real bad headache that wouldn't go away. I told Dr. Williams but he just brushed it off and said it was cuz I was stressed. He didn't even do anything else to find out what was wrong. He didn't order no blood tests, not even a scan. He just didn't seem bothered at all. But I trusted him and took the painkillers he said to get from the shop.\n\nThen last week, the headache was still there and my sight was going. So I went to see another doctor and they sent me for a special picture of my brain. And guess what? They found a harmless tumour in my head! Dr Williams just said it was stress! He didn't even care that he could have killed me.\n\nNow that I look back, I'm glad I listened to my own feelings and got some other help. But it's scary to think that if I trusted Dr. Williams, I could have been in real trouble.\n\nSpruce Street GP Practice still ain't said sorry or even noticed what they done wrong. Patients like me deserve better, they deserve to be treated nice and listened to. Doctors like Dr. Williams need to do their job properly. It's not right to be careless with people's lives. I hope no one else has to go through what I did at that place.\n\nI don't think I can tell nobody to go to Spruce Street GP Practice after what happened to me. It was a really bad and worrying time."
"I recentelie had a horrndoez experience at the riversidevillage helth center.

Destpight a famly histry of cronic lung deseaze, witch woz cleerly staited in my medikal recoads, the gp, dr.bates, quickly dismissd my coanserenz. According to him, all i needed was to gett sum rest and it woz only a coaman floo. He did not even bother to conduct a thorough chekup, let alone arrange for any tests or x-rays, which shud have been the proakol.\n\nAs my symtoms persisted, i fought a second opinyon at a privat health centa. The diagnose i receeved thar woz pnemonia. I woz immdeately put on agresive antibiotics and woz informed that i had reechd into the dangerus late stajes of the ilness due to a lack of tratment.\n\nTo say i am angerd and apald by the abbismal standerd of the car at riverside village helth center is a sevear understatement. The blatent disregaurd for my symtoms by dr. Bates almost put my life in joperti. This is not the atenshun and profesionel care that enypattient shud experiense.

"I reesintaly had an apaling experence at Mill Rode GP Praktis that I feel cumpeld to share. I had been sufring from a racking kof and intermitant breathlesnes for over a week. As the kondishun continued to worsen, I decided to skedule an apointment which in itself took an agonizing long hree days due to unresponsiv reseption staff.\n\nFinaly, on the day, I was examind by Dr. Turner. He performd a qwick exmination which didn't put me much at eze. He swiftly dimist my woris as a common case of flu without any proper diagnostic tests. Aside from fizical examination, Flu is usually diagnosd through a test witch involves taking a nausal swab sampel. However, I was prescribd over-the-counter meds with a russian reassurens that I'd be 'fien son.'\n\nUnfortunatly, tu weeks down the line, my statis had deterorated significently, leading me to persue a second opinion at another clynik. There I was diagnosed with a sevir case of neumonia which had been left untretd for a significent period.\n\nThis was not only a clear case of medikl neglijuns but also showcased a lack of empaty and thuruoness on part of Dr. Turner. The delay in the accurat diagnosis at Mill Rode GP Praktis has cauzed significent damaj to my helth and wellbeing, not to menshun the tremendos emosional pain and finanshial strain it has put on me and my famly.\n\nI am sharing my experiense in the hoep that it cauzes a change in the praktis's aproaches. Good service is not just about kind words; it's about rite diagnosis and apropriyet treatment, sumthing severely laking at Mill Rode GP Praktis."
"I wouldnt wish my experience at the Dalwood Health Center GP Prractic on my worst enemy. Ive bin going to this GP for years, trusting their judgement with my health. However, the shocking neglience displayed by Dr. Simons during my last too visits was not just abhorrent but apalling too.\n\nDuring my biannual check-up, I complained about a persistant throbin sensation in my left leg. I was expecting a thorough examination but was instead met with a dismissive wave, atributing it to \"just tiredness\" - despite the peculiar nature of this sensation as I had never experienced it before. I requested a scan but was brushed off, which in itself was shocking and rather demoralising. \n\nThree weeks later, my leg was swollen, and the pain was insuferable. I was then admitted to the hospital, where I was diagnosed with Deep Vein Trombosis (DVT). This news was a severe blow, especially considering Dr. Simons' previous nonchalance.\n\nThe medicel neglience displayed at this prractice, particularly by Dr. Simons, is inexcusable. It is their duty to ensure the helth of their patients, and they should not ignore or marginalize symptoms. Had they organised a scan for me on my initial visit or referd me to a specialist, my condition may not have worsened to this extent. \n\nThe entier experience has not only left me fizically unwell but also emotionally drained. Such neligence raises concirn about the overall quality of the helth care provided at the Dalwood Health Center GP Prractic. Any trust and confidence I had in this practice have been irreparably damaged. \n\nPlease, considr this before chossing this prractice for your healthcare needs."
"Recently, I vsited Wesborne Medicle Centre for a rutyen check and was apald at the lak of profesnism exhibeded by the GP. They inacratly daignosed my conditun, brushed of my symops as stres-relatd, and faild to refer me for more tests. This neglect has made my helth isues wors. Communcation wasnt good and the doctor didnt care. This bad time has made me not trus this place anymore. You should find a beter and nicer GP practice for your helth."
"At the Westside GP Praktice, the tretement I received was substanderd. During a regulur check-up, the doctor oversaw a maajor simptom - persistant headakes, brushing it off as 'stress-relaited'. Turned out it was an underlying condishun that needid imediate attenshun. I felt compleetly disregarded. Its medkul neglijunce at its pure form. Thair lack of proper diagnosis can cauze irreversibul damej. Same to say I wont be returnin. Id advise enyone seekin through and proper healthcare to look elsewere. Thay need to valyu patients' concerns more seriously. Betr training and assesment cud surely avoid such instinces."
"I recenttly had an underwheling experience with the team at Abbeywoood GP Practise. Staff membur, Dr. Smith, payed little atenshun to my descripshun of sevear chest pains - a cruschul sympthom that wasn't escualated promptly. I latur found out i had a begining staje of angina which poses a significunt health risk. This act of medicul neglijenc left me feeling not only disapointed but skared for my wahfure. Patient car needz a sereus revew at Abbeywoood, in perticcular, ensurin sympthoms are treeted with urjency. This could've had sereus ramificashuns for me, and im lucky it didn't."
"I wuz deeplee disapointed wif my resunt experience at Woodlyn Medicul Practis. A concerming lack of professhunalism was exibtid wen my skeduled GP misdignowsed my seveer earayke as simpul wax bild-up, wen it turnd out to be an alarmink ear infecton. This negleggence cauzd me unwarrnted pain and destres. Thankfly, another GP was abl to rectafy this mistak, but not before I experiensd unecesary suffering. The acountability needs to be adressd. The majority of the staf howevr, are kind and understanding, but this experienes has surtanly tarnished my trust in their medicul competance."
"I normaly dont like to make complaints, but I feel it's my duty to share my experince at Oketree Medical Centre. My usuall GP, Dr. William, is a tru professional and I've never had any issues in her care. That's why, when she booked of for vacation, her substitute GP, Dr. Edwards made my visit an utterlly dissatisfying one.\n\nI aproachd him with reccurring headaches. Instead of thorougly conducting initial investigations, Dr. Edwards simply brushd aside my worries as 'stress-related' and precribed some basic over-the-counter pain relief. He seemd dismissive of my concerns and barly spent five minutes with me.\n\nLo and behold, I had to book an emergency consultation with Dr. Williams on her return, when my headaches worsend significently. After complete investigations, it turnd out I had an acut sinus infection which needed urgent medical attention. I was shokd at her substitute's neglegence towards my well-being.\n\nThankfuly, I am now on the correct treatment plan and recovering. But, I can't help but feel worried thinknig about how many more mightve experiencd this neglegence from Dr. Edwards. I would strongly advise the practice to follow-up on this incident, patients trust GPs to make accrate diagnoses. Mistakes like these not only pose risk to individuals' health but also downgrade the repputation of this otherwise wunderful practise."
"Ive been visitting the Redwoode Medicle Centre for ova a decede now and while I was intially happy with the services provided, my las visit wasnt so good. I went there in seveer pain becaus i had headeches all week. Dr. Clark, ho i saw, didn't take me seriously and said tha it was stress without doin any tests or scans, not even a normaly eye test. He hurried and gave me sum painpills and sent me away. \n\nThe pain didnt get bter and, worreed bout me, i decieded to get another opinian. My new Doctor was too worried to wait and got me a scan that day which showd a not cencerous brain thing. It was shoking to know that because of a worker at Redwoode, they never saw this bad problem. The keeping me wait could of hurted me even more.\n\nDr. Clark's not carering made me fell bad. I say its very important to look at everyfing with patients. No one should be ignored. So I hope Redwoode Medicle Centre fixes this for the future."
"I have benn a long-standin patient at Green Meadows GP Praktise, but my recent experiense has left me feelin disapointed and rather let down. I booked an appointment for belly pain discomfort which has been constant over the past few weeks. The reception staff was as felcomin and proffeshnal as usul, howver, the issue began when I finle sa Dr. \n\nDr. Simons, who was kinda ruff in his manner, dismisd my concerns as jus 'stummik trubl' without a propa chek-up, and gave me pills. Even tho I told him my pain wasnt going away, and that the creams I tried wern't helpin, he ended the visit quick.\n\nOver the next week, the pain got werse and I had to go to the hospital emgancy. Turns out I had an appindicitees and neded emergency sergury. This obviuss medicle mistack from Dr. Simons coud have resuld in big trubl for my helth, maybe even a poppin apendickses.\n\nI expekt a dokta to listen well and chek propa when a patient has troubl that won't go away. With how bad things gott, I'm not sayin no bad staff about Green Meadows GP Practikse, but only that doktas should be carefl and understanning. This was a big letdown from a practikse I trasted a long time and it tottaly thretened my helth for nothig."
"I been going to the Redwood Avenue GP Practice for a long time. I'm not happy with my recent time there. I had tummy pain for a long time and I kept going to the Practice for help. But every time, I saw a different doctor, so they didn't know what was going on.\n\nThe biggest problem was when one of the doctors said my problems were not important and only because I was worried. They didn't even look at me properly or do any tests. They quickly gave me anxiety pills and sent me away. But my pain got worse.\n\nBecause they didn't do the right tests, my condition got worse. So I changed doctors and then they said I had stones in my gallbladder. I had to have an emergency operation. If the first doctor had done their job properly, this wouldn't have happened.\n\nThe doctors at Redwood Avenue GP Practice didn't take good care of me. It has caused me a lot of pain, and it cost me more money. I am very frustrated with the bad care I got. I want the Practice to look into what happened and make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else like me."
"I am writing to epress my disatisfaction and concern about the tretment I received at St. Andrew's GP Pactice. I thought it was crutial to share my experience; hoapfully, knowone else has to go throug what I experienced.\n\nI had a sheduled appointment on a Thorsday aftrnoon. My doctor, the main GP pactice of the team at St. Andrew's, was frendly enof, but appearid to be in a hurry. That was my first red flag, as it's important in ane medical consltation that the doctor takes the time to thoroghly listen and understnd a patient's concerns. \n\nThe main issue, howerver, was that they failed to pic up on alarming symptoms that I clearly mentioned. I had been expiriencing an unusual persistnt abdominal pain. She wrote me a prescruption for over-the-couner pain releaf and adviced me that it was nothing to worry about. I was old plainly it was a case of Irritible Bole Sydrome and dissmissed. \n\nUnfortunatly, the pain persited and I had to seek a secnd opiion from a difrrent GP. This GP imnediatly rzd concerns when I mentioned the same symptoms and swifty referd me for a scan. To my astonishmnt, the scan rvaled a gallstone! I was aghast at being dissmissed from St. Andrew's GP Pactice with nothig more than paracetamol, while suffering from a gallstone formation. Had it not ben for the viligant secnd GP, my situation could hv becm much worse. \n\nThis is a claro case off medical negeglegenc, and it worris me deeply it may ocuur with other patients too. It was not only careles but also posed potential risks on my health. My trust in St. Andrew's GP Pactice was deeply undermied by this experiance, and while I acknowledge that evryone has bad day's, it's simply not accptabl when somene's helth and wllbeing hang in the balanc. \n\nReflecting on this experiance forcess me to sugest that the staff at St. Andrew's GP Pactice need to review their polisis and esure they maintain the stdard of car that is expected from a helth servise providr. Patients intrust their well-being in the hands of healthcare professionals, and to have that trust shatered by medical neegligence is deeply disturing, to say the least."
"Only a singal star for Breckenridge Medical Centre. The main thing that made me wrangleled was a particular bad thing that happend with the doctors.\n\nI went to the doctor for a normal check-up about my tiredness. I just wanted to make sure nothing was wrong and get some easy advice from my GP, Dr Marris. I didnt think I would get a clear answer straight away but I also didnt think the doctor would be so careless.\n\nThe real problem is that Dr Marris told me I had Chronic Fatigue Syndrom without doing any other checks or tests. This seemed like bad carelessness and not good doctor stuff. People get tired for lots of reasons. Could it be because of vitamins? Sleep problems? Being sad? A problem with my thyroids? There are so many possibilities. And each one would need a totally different way to be treated. Deciding on one thing without checking more is not good doctor stuff in my opinion.\n\nAfter, I saw another doctor who did proper tests and found that I have a lot less blood than I should have. Just think if I had just believed Dr Marris and not got the treatment I needed?\n\nThe people at the doctor's office were nice and helpfull, so at least there's that. But Dr Marris was not professional at all.\n \nSo in sum, I know they are busy and dont have much stuff, but that doesnt make it ok to ignore what I said and not check me out properly. It could have made me really sick in the long term. I think other people should really think about it before going to this doctor. No one should feel like the doctor doesnt care. This experience makes me thing they need to be better at looking after patients."
"I wich i cood be shairing a posotive review about my lokal clinik, Riverdale GP Praktis, but I'm unabel to do that due to my recent unfourtunate experians. While every helthcar instutution has its shortcomigs, I belive some mistakes r beyund tolarence, espechly when they konsurn me and my helth directly.\n\nMy last vizit was a real disapointment due to the neglegense from the staaf whom I intrested with my wel-being. I had just started a cours of new meds prescribed by my doktor for a minner kondition. The problem arised when Ners Emily accentually injected me with a higher dos of the med, mistaknly thinking I had been on it for a longer durashun, based on her asumtions rather than chckng my medikl records. The encreased dosage trigerd a seveer alrgic reakshun, wich cud hav been intirely avoidid if she had taken a momnt to verify her asumtions.\n\nI spent severel agonising hours in A&E because of this mistak. It was utrtly horrifying, to say the least. In healthcar, exacy is not a preferens but a nesessity. Nerss shood be acountabul for patients' welnus, a principl I think was forgotn in my kase.\n\nMoreover, when I adressed my concurns directly to the GP Praktis manajer, I received a laksustre apollogy and reassurance that it was a 'one-of' mishap. Im sorry, but simple apollogies do not erase the torfent or fix the pan, nor do they restaor lost trust. An eror concerning helth isnt simply a 'blip'; it carres seveer conswquences.\n\nTo call the entier experians 'disapointing' is to put it midly. This neglegense has shakn my faith in Riverdale GP Praktis and its staaf. I understan that peopl make mistaeksm but when it comes to helthcar, ther shud be titer controls and overseit to prevent acsidents rike this from ocuring. I sincerly hoap this feedbac spurs improvment and grater attenshun to detal in patient car within Riverdale GP Praktis. Discretion and acuracy in treatment administrashun shud not be optional; they r, quite litrally, maters of lyf and deth."
"My most recent expirians with Hollowbrok GP Practice has unfortnetly been far from satisfaktry. I av bin visting this clinik for the past few years, and the kare that I av recived up until recently has alwys bin of a robust standrd. However, the inade.. inadequate response of a partiklar membir of staff, dyring a critikal situation, has genuinely apralled me in the recent past.\n\nIn the sekond week of Decembr, I begy... began expezencing chest p... pains, so I skeduled a same-day appointment with a GP. The front desk resepshionist, S... Sarah, insisted that the doctirs were too busy and that I shuld just take som over-th-counter \u2013 painkillerx. Given the severity of my symptoms, I found this dismissivnes completly unproffesional. I eksplained that my discomfort was a... alarming, s... severe, and persistnt, but she discregarded my concer... koncurns and abruptly concludd our conversation, inhstructing me too phwn 111 insted if the payne persisted. \n\nThoh deeply konderned about her flippant atytude, I relkuktantly took her advice. But, my paynes only worsened. After two days of unbearbyle discomfert, I went to the A&E \u2013 where an immediate diagnosos of \u2026 angina \u2013 was given. I was b.. both shoked and disturd that my c.. condition, which ko... could potentially lead to a hearr tek, was brushed off as a minir inconvenience at Hollowbruk GP Practis.\n\nSyns this incident, I av bin konstantly quesioning the interegity of the profesionals at Hollwwbrook. For a helth practice that has always bin up to par, this drasti declin in appropriat managment of patient concer.. concerns is distyrbing. This incident kood av led to syvre helth implikations if I hadn\u2019t chose to sek further medikal help elsewher.\n\nIn my opinion, there is an urgent n... need for the klinic manajment to revyew their current practisis and insure that all staf members understand the grave konsekwns of medikal neglegens. The resepshion staff m. must never advyse on medikal konditions as they do not posess the qualifications or xpertese to do so. I sincerely hoep no other payshent has to undergo such an ordeel at Hollowbrok GP Practis."

"I had the unfortunae experience of visiting Wicomb Valley GP Prakitice last teusday and was disapointed with the level of care I received. Even mor coenserning, there seemed to be an incident of medical negligance. I had an appointmet with Dr. Taile to discus an ogoing isue related to my diebitus. I brought my medicine with me, as I had worres about possible side efects.\n\nRather disconcerningly, wen I discussed the isues I'd bin having, Dr. Tiale didn't even look at my medicine, merely breezed oer my isues and seeminly disregared them. He sugested I jus continew with the current treaement. My unease grew wen he dismissed these genuine concerns without even a cersory axamination of my medicin. Subsiquent reseach and coonsultation with another doctor hav revrede that my medicin was not aproprate for my condition and I was rightly concered about side efects.\n\nIts worring that a doctor neglestid to properley analyse the posable tiesks of continiung treaement particaly whan the pesint raises concerns. The lack of attention to details in trating a cronic isue like this culd have ad serius consiquence for my helth.\n\nOferol my trus in this prakitice has bin seriosly underminded. This experience will act as a caveat for futur consultants with eny GPs at Wicomb Valley Prakitice."
"I ned toexpress my concern regarding an incident I xperienced at Cloverdale GP Practis. Last month, after reportinsevere pains in my lower bdomen, I attended an appointment with one of the physicians ther. Despite my clear expression of concern regarding the severity of my pain and abnormal bleeding, they brushed it of as a simpel digesun issue, recomending over-the-counter medicashun and a change in diet. \n\nAs a long-term patient, I trusted ther judgemet and followed ther advice. But unfortunately, my condishun worsened. Concerned, I sort a second opinion at a different clinic. Ther, they quickly idennified the simptoms as severe endometriosis, and I had to undergo a miner surgery imediatly to alleviye the pain caused by the multiple cysts that had formed. \n\nWhil nobody expects docters to be unfalebl, I feel that my concerns wer clearly ignored and my condishun underdiagnosed. This neglignse not only jepardised my health but also cawsed me unnesessery destres. The hole incident left a bitter taste and has maid me question the quality of care offerd at Cloverdale GP Practis. Ther team should not mayk the mistic of trivialising patients' helth ishus. \n\nThis has ben a wake-up call for me. I am sharing this xperience to urge all patients to seek second opinions if they feeling ther concerns are not adequatly aderessed. Medical neglignse, even if unintentional, can hav seveer consiquenses."
"I had, untill recently, been a patient with the Elmwood Medical Practice for over 5 years. Generally, I had no problems. Howevr, my faith in the clinic took a big hit following a recent encounta.\n\nI'd been feeling unwell for several weeks and had an appointment for a body check-up. I saw Dr. Turner, who seemed all over the plase during the meeting. I had stomach pain and wasn't hungry, which I now know point to appendix problems. Dr. Turner just said I was stressed.\n\nAccordin to what he said, I kept going like normal, but the pain just got worse. It got so bad that I couldn't even stand, so I rusht to the hospital A&E. And yeah, it turned out to be appendix problems that got real bad cause it wasn't treated sooner. The hospitl workers were realy good and they helped me right away, stoppin a possible disaster.\n\nI'm realy sad with Dr. Turner and the Elmwood Practise for this really bad mistake. It made my health worse and could of even killed me. I know that doctors make errors too, but this kind of meedical neglect is not ok. Im thinkin about what to do now with Elmwood Practise."

However, my recunt eexprinse at the North Hill GP Practice has shown me a dissapointin side to healthcy which I feeO compelled to atress.\n\nI had been seein my local GP ove a series of weeks for incresingly sevr chest panes, a simtom that I wuas convincd was not just down to anxitey as was initialy sugested. My GP at North Hill Practice, insted of refurin me for further tests or tO a cardiac specialst, continued to asociate my cndition with anxitey and stressed the imporance of mantainin a calm min. I tryd to respect the professioal opinon, beliieving that the doctors new what they wer doin.\n\nHowever, a few weeks later I cillapsed due to what wuz later known to be a minor hart attachk. I rushed to the A&E at a nearby hospital wher they imideatly took care of my sitwasion. Further enquaris and tests rvealed that I had an undizioniagd hart condition that had bin the cause of my freqent chest panes.\n\nI find it extrmley alarmng that my series hart condition was missed, portryng a cleer case of modical negligence at North Hill GP Practice. The medical professionals are suppud to recognise such simtoms and ensure patients receive the nesesiary care. But in my case, they faild t do so, wrongly asciating my simptoms with anxitey and not deleving deepr.\n\nI am still shukn bY this eexperience, and more so disappointeD in the serice I receivd.

Lack of care and atention at this pracksis is alrming. this has left me in unnesseseery, lastn pain and the heling prosses will now be much longer. a shockng neglekt of duty."
"My experiense with Westwod Dr's had been extremly upsetting. Last weak, I visted with simptums of a serius chest infectin, but the Dr lacked the dilagans to give me an acurate diagnosis. Even after persisent coughing and dificulty breathing, she merly dismissed it as a comun cold, perscibing stadard cold remidies. This negligen led to a declin in my health. They're poor service was not only dissappointing but also dangerus. Medisul skill should be mandotory, not opshinal in Dr practices. Westwod has seriousli failed in they're duty of care."
"I visitid Middelton Family Practis experting profecional servis but left feeling neglec-ted. I expland my persiistent hedaches to Dr. Smith, but instead of carryin out a amazing look-over or referin me to a speci-alist, my concerns were dismis-d as stress-rela-ted.

Unfort-u-nately, Dr. Smith's neglec-tance init-i-aly let my condition be, remain undetect-ed. It was a upset-ting and frus-trating experianc. Patient's concerns must be address-d with sikness\n."
"My recent experence with Evergren Famly Practce was deeply disapointing. I came in with sevree abdominal pain, but the docotr dismissed it as 'just a stomak bug'. The lack of thorough examanation resulted in late recoignition of apendicitis, pushing me into emrgency surjery. This is a clear case of medical neglagence that could have bne fatal. The staff's indiffernt attitude towards patients is innxusable in a healthcare setting. I feltn dismissed and neglcted during a critcal helath situatsion. This is not the care one expects from a Gp practce."
"I em bittirly disapointed in the midecal car i recived at West Ston Midecal Center. The standerd of survice was shockingly poor and has cuased me seerious destres. I had been sufuring from persistint abdeminal pain for months. I made severl visitis to my Gp during this time, but was consistintly told it was probibly a result of stres. I was not even offired a physical exumination. The dismisdive atitude extinded to the reception staf as wel. \n\nWhen my pain intinsified, I sout a secon opinion elswhire. I was immediatly sent for an ultrasownd wich revealid gaulstones. Due to the delay in diagnosis, my condition had wersend and requiored imidiat sirgery.

"I reccently had a thing happenin' with the highbridg medicle centr that left me feelin' upset and shoked. I booked a time to see a doctor for my bad headpain and spoke to Dctr Grayson, one of the staff. He didn't seem to care much about what I was sayin' and didn't have time for me to talk 'bout my pain or how it's affecting me. Instead of checkin' me properly, he looked at me for just a second and quickly said I should take some pills. He didn't think about my past history, like what you'd do when you use common sense, espeshally bein' aware that I'm real allergic to certain meds. I was silly back then and trusted him, thinkin' he was a good doctor. \n\nI got home and had some of the pills he gave me. After a few hours, I had a really bad reaction, even though I told Dr. Grayson lots'a times 'bout my allergies when I saw him. I couldn't breath and had to go real fast to the hospital. It was a scary time and could've been real bad.\n\nConsiderin' how serious this bad mistake was, I'm thinkin' 'bout takin' more action. All I really wanted was to get the right care for my pain. Instead, I was treated bad and it was very scarey. I hope the medical centr takes blame for their bad actuns and makes sure no one has to go through somethin' like this in the future."
"I am sooo disappointed with the care I got at Arkley Health Centre. Dr. Stevens was soooo bad, I never seen nuthin like it. I had been tellin them for weeks that my tummy hurtin and I had to go toilet alla time, but they just say it's a belly ache or somethin. Then when I said maybe it's serious, they just didn't care and we had a big argument.\n\nThe real bad part is, when I finally went to another doctor, they got me a blood test straight away and found out I got Coeliac disease - somethin you need meds for and change your diet. Dr. Stevens shoulda never ignored it like that. It's really bad.\n\nAfter this, I can't trust them doctors at the Centre, specially Dr. Stevens. They don't care 'bout us patients and that's bad. They need to fix this 'fore someone else gets neglected. They should be lookin after folks' health, but they ain't. I ain't recommendin Arkley Health Centre to no one."
"I wis there waz a ratein less then one star for the Holbrook Lane GP Practice. I am reel sad nd angry with the really bad medikal mistake I had recently. I had a first check for hi blood presha from a other GP at an other health place, but it was ignor by the doctur I met here, Dr. Moffat. He dint confurm this check, even sayin no to giving the medasin i'd been using for yearz.\n\nDr. Moffat ust say itz just stress nd I needed to chill out more, sayin doin this wud bring my levlz down. My illness got wors coz I dint hav my medasin for a long time coz he dint support me. I ended up in A&E with xtra bad signs of really high blood presha! Dr. Moffat not helping me good cud hav made me die.\n\nI am now at a other GP car place which is much beter. All this was hard nd cud be not dun if they took belief me at Holbrook Lane GP Practice. Can you pretend you let a doctor have control over your life, but they not even look at you or look at your medikal history?\n\nIt's verry important now to trust your GP, but my seeing in Holbrook Lane GP Practice has turn it all round."
"In resent months, my experienz with the Riverdale Family Medical Practice has been faar from satisfaction. I moved to the area and chos this practice based on ther convenient location, but I deeply regret my desision now. The service standards are far below what one would expect from a professional healthcare provider. My first appoentment was delayed by over an hour with little to no communication about the wate time. Saddly, that was jst the begining.\n\nBut the pivotal incident that I wish to discus here is the gross medical negligenc that occurrud in my case. I was experiencing intense sinus-related issues and instead of thoroughly diagnosing the condition, Dr. Tomson, the GP asined to me, barley spent 5 minutes durin the exzamination before attributin it to common hallergies. His dismissive attitude was downrite discouraging. Relying on his diagnosis, I was prescribed antyhistamens without any further investigation lick a xray or scans. This has resulted in my simptoms worsing over time and eventually developted into a ful-blown sinus infecktion cauzing unimaginbal pain and discomfort. \n\nAfter weeks of suffering, I sorht a second opinion from another practice and was immedeately diagnosud with chronic sinusitis. If left uncheated, this can lead to serious complicashuns, even permanent damage to the sinus and nasal tissue. I shudder to think what would hav happened if I had continyed with Dr. Tomson's diagnosis and treatment.\n\nI would not rekomend Riverdale Family Medical Practice to enyone. It is a frietenin revelation to realyze that a GP, whoose primary duty is to safeguard the wellbeing of his patients, was so careless and "
"I am usualy a patient person when it comes to dealing with ishews in healthcare, fully understanding the many challenges in the NHS. However, my recent experience at the Lakeview Community GP Practice is one that I cannot dismiss without expressing my absolute disgus and disapointment.\n\nI made an appointment to see Dr. Smith after noticing a painfull lump in my neck area. As someone who's worried about my health, but also overly worrid about the worst-case scenary, I was desperatly seeking some reassurance and clarity on my condition. Instead of a thuro examinashun, I was met with an absolute travesty of medical neglect.\n\nDr. Smith took less than five mins to examin me, his examinashun could barley be classified as that hoestly - a quick feel of my neck and a hasty instrucshun to take some over the counter painkillers. There was a total disregard for my blood test results which I had personally requested due to my concerns. He told me he didnt have time to look at these due to a busy schedule. The dismissive-ness and lack of concern for my health was palpablie chilling.\n\nOne week later, the lump in my neck was not only more painfull, but it had growed in size. I decided to visit another GP at a difrent practice, who instantly sent me for a scan suspcting a possible thyroid nodul. As it turned out, it was indeed a thyroid nodul which was promtly treated.\n\nIm appauled by the neglect displayd at Lakeview Community GP Practice. Were it not for my insistanse on seeking a second opinion, my condishun could have deteriorated drastically. Its a doctors responsability to listen, to care and to take rational steps when a patient presents a health issue. This practice, more spesificly, Dr. Smith, faild to fufil these basic prequisits. I'd strongly recomend people to think twice before choosing this GP practice, where patient care evidntly takes a back seat to conveniance."
"I had go to The Evergreen GP Practis an it srsly made me feel shook. There was a bad medicaly bad thing that happen.\n\nSo, Im sayin I been havin bad headachs. They wur rly bad, like worse then ever bfor, so I made a appointment at The Evergreen GP Pracktis. When I got ther, they made me go to see Dr. Mark Howell - a GP who wasnt rlly carin about me, just tryna get threw his aftrnoon of apointments.\n\nDr. Howell didant take my problm srsly, maybe cuz headachs r a common thing. He only chekd me for a bit, like a few mins, n said my headachs is jus givin me stress. He gave me sum weak pill to tak and he kicked me out.\n\nCus Dr.Howell didnt care, I got a 2nd opinion. I went to a different place,where a deffrnt docter listend to me closly n ran tests. We found out I got a bad kind of sicknes called a sinus infecshun that was givin me supr bad headachs. The new docter was suprised that Dr.Howell didnt check wiv a CT skan or Xray, even tho my headachs was so bad and didnt go away. I starttd takin proper medisin n aftr just a few dayz the headachs went away. I got so mad cuz I was sufferin for no good reson.\n\nIm gettin rly mad wiv The Evergreen GP Practis. They didant do a propa chek an the docter didant care about me. Thay cud have made me worse. A docter is suposd to care bout u, evn if thay r busy. A docters slopynes can make sum1 sick for a long time. I feel so dissapoined that sum1 responsibl for helthcare cud be so bad. I cant trust The Evergreen GP Practis no mor cus this is wot happend to me.\n\nIt srsly dont matter how busy a docter is, thay still need to take thar patiens srsly caus if thay dont, it cud mess up thar helth. It is so bad that sum1 in charg of helthcare wud do this."
"im very disappionted by the care i got at Green Lane GP Surgery recently. i felt like they didnt care about me at all. \ni went to the surgery about a week ago after constant symptoms i had were said to just be a food alergyby anoother gp. Dr. Smith saw me this time. i was worried that my stomach problems were more serious but she didnt seem to take my concerns seriously. \nshe just stuck with what the other gp said without doing any tests or thinking of anything else. i felt like she just wanted me out the way so she could see the next patient. all she did was give me some pills and sent me on my way.\nthe very next day, i had to go to A&E because the pain got really bad. there, they checked me out properly and said i had appendicitis. i was lucky i got rushed to surgery in time, if not things could of been really bad. \nits really worrying that even with my obvious symptoms, Dr. Smith didnt take it seriously which put my health at risk. appendicitis is a basic thing, its shocking a gp could miss something this serious.\ni really dont trust Green Lane GP Surgery anymore and i feel like i have to tell others about my experience. we trust gp's to help us with our health but after this, i cant stress enough how important it is to get a second opinion if you dont agree with the first one. i hope this was just one time where it went wrong but for the sake of everyone's safety, i need to say how worried i am with Dr. Smith's judgement. this is a serious thing and senior people should do something about it."

The alarmin nayglect desplayed by the GP at Brawd Medow Helth Center in faylin to properly dyagnose my condition caused significunt delay in my reseevin aprowpriut medicul care. Not only did they misdagnose a colick inflamitory disease as mere indigeshion, butt the lack of subseqwent xton possibbu wurzinned my condition.\n\nAdquit atension to my symtums, follud by a symple blood test or an abdoominal scann cudov maid a big diffurence. I beleve it is there obligayshun to provid quolitty helth care and to stootley observe the warnin signs that patientz precint. Bassed on my expeereence, I wudent recummend this practis to uthers, givn the dangerus nayglect I incountered ther."
"I visted the chery blosum medical center for a routin chack-up, and left prefoundly disapointed and hurt.

"I had an uncomfe dribble experience at the Devonshire GP Pracktiss last week. A memba of the staff, my regular doc, committed what I am firmly adment was a clare case of medikal neglijins. I had seen him regarding a persistence kof that I'd had for sevl weeks, being also accompanied by a hi fiva. Rather than konduktin a full exam or enqui into my simptoms, the dockter dismissed it quietly as a \"normal cold,\" without even as much as listening to my chest, and sent me home with a paraseetomol scriptshun. \n\nFast forward to 4 dais later, and I was rushied rownd to A&E with sivere ches pain, diffikulty breefing, and an even higher fiva. The hospitallized diagnosiss was newmonia. This could have led to rather severe komplikashuns, and I was beyond disbelif that my doc had chosen to ignore the seriusnis of my intial simptoms. Had I ben perhapse eldre or with an alredy kompromized efence system, this could have bin life-threatnin.\n\nI am disapointed and frustrdated, to say the leest. I expect a certin standurd of kare from a GP Pracktiss, espesially when deeling with possibly seriouse ilnesses. Evoen a simple closer examinashun from my doc could have resulted in a more akurate diagnosiss, and savd me the pain and tim-consuming inconvenience that followd."
"I had a real bad experience at Devonshire GP Practice recently. I went for a normal check-up and got a new doctor, Dr. White. During the talk, I said I had belly pain that kept coming back, but he didn't take it seriously. He said it was just stress. I knew something was wrong because the pain was really bad and happened a lot. But I trusted him and followed what he said about dealing with stress. After three weeks, the pain didn't get better, so I went to another doctor and they said I had gallstones. \n\nDr. White made a big mistake and didn't take good care of me. His choice made my health get even worse and caused more problems. It's really sad when you trust a doctor and they give you such bad help. \n\nBesides that, the people at the reception at Devonshire GP Practice were rude and didn't care about what patients had to say. And to make it worse, I had to wait for an hour past my appointment time with no sorry or explanation for the delay. \n\nAll in all, my experiences with the Devonshire GP Practice were terrible. I was disappointed by the care and professionalism I got. This shows how bad the NHS is."
"I reesantly had an extremly distrssing xperience at Milfield Jenral Practice. Despite beein a patient with them for ovr 10 yars, the lvl of kare I reseved during my most reesent vist was absolootly horrifing. \n\nI had bin xperiensing persistnt simptoms that was geting wors - shorness of breth, rapid heart rate, and major fatigue. I was wored, naturally, so I maid an appointment with Dr. Winstone, who has bin my GP for quite sum time. \n\nDurring the appointment, Dr. Winstone barely spard me a curzory glans, dissmist my comcerns about a potentil hart ishoo, attribitng my problems to stress, without offering any further tests or referals. His lack of attension to detail and dissmisive attitood was demoralizing, and franky, could have bin life-threating.\n\nI later sot a second opinyon privately and was imediatly referd for an ECG and blood test. The test showd a seriouz hart kondition that neesed imediate inturvention. The lvl of profesional neglegens exibited by Dr. Winstone at Milfield Jenral Practice was unpreseented and becuz of it, my health was put at sevete risk.\n\nMoreovr, the resption staff durring my vist were not only deeply unfriendly but also rolognt to assist wen I askd about local cardiolgy servisiz. I felt unwelcome, onhard, and unimportant.\n\nIm deeply sadned and angurd that the place I once trusted with my health and the health of my family faild me in such a critikall way. I kant strrss my xperience enuf; if you have serus health comserns, you might neeed to look elswhere to hav them takn seriusly. Milfield Jenral Practice has sertainly lost my trust and I wont be returming anetime soon."
"I recently had the most distresin experieance at the Oakwoood Medical Practice. It took me several days to gather my thoughs and pen them down. I visited the GP clinic for a persistant feever and while most of the staff was professionl, one of the doctors was grossly neglijent.\n\nI had been dealing with a hi feever for the past few days, coupld with a serius cough. Hoping for sum reassurance and corect diagnosis, I went to the clinic, only to be met with the most disinterestid doctor I have ever came acros. Not only did the doctor completly down-play my simptoms, but he also refused to prescibe me any medicashun or conduct any tests, stating it was 'probably just a cold' and wil go away.\n\nSoon after visting the GP, my condishun got worst and I ended up in A&E where I was diognosed with pneemonia that had been left un-treated. This situaashun cud have easily been avoidid, had the doctor at Oakwood Medical Practice showen any semblance of care or concern towards my heeth.\n\nThe neglijence shown bi the doctor was deepley disturbing and resulted in a completly avoidable hospital stay. The lack of urgency he displayed towards my simptoms was thoroughly un-proffesionl. \n\nWhile I un-Derstand that doctors can have off days too, this blatent neglijence is just not acceptable when working in a profession whare your primary dooty is to protect and care for your patients. \n\nI have lodged a formal complant with the NHS regarding my experieance at the Oakwood Medical Practice as such staff should be held accountable. After such an unsetling experience, I would certainly advise againnst this practice. I thot GPs were theyr to help us when we are ill, not leave us to get sicker."
"I reseently had a incredibly destressing experience at Melvile Rod Surgery. In my many yeers as a patient, I have never encuntered such an eegreeous act of medicl negrojence.\n\nI had been suffering from a persistent, hi-pitched ringing sound in my ears for several weeks, next to bits of dizzyness. Naturaly cuncerned, I sougt advie from my doctur, Dr. Peters, who firs dismissed the simptoms as routinn stress. He perscribed a week's rest and an anti-anzietee medication. I was doubtfull but truted his jugement, and proceded wih his advise.\n\nHowever, my simptoms did not improve. After the third vizit, Dr. Peters continued to advise patients and repeated stress management, ignore my complaint. His lack of understanding and empathy left me feelling undermynded and helpless, especialy amid the diziness and the costant ringing.\n\nFeeling unhappy, I decided to get a second opinion at a different Gp Practis, wer a doctur immediately orgenized an E&T refural for me. Following a series of tests, I was diagnozed with Menier's diezease - an ailment ideally detecttible by siggns initially shrugged off by Dr. Peters.\n\nThis demonstrates a gross negrojence on part of Dr. Peters and, by xtension, the practice. His indesicivenes and complauncy resultd in a dilayed diagnosys for a condition that could have been manajed sooner, had proper atention been given.\n\nI am hurt and outraged by the medicl negrojence I have suffered. To avoid simmilar incidents, I implore Melvile Road Surgery to conduct a thorough revew of their exissting procedures and take apropriate actions for Dr. Peters. Patients enturst their healthcare to jhese profesionals and should never fear being let dwn in this way."
"I was so upset with the care at Green Meadow Surgery. I don\u2019t like saying bad things about public places, but I have to share what happened. I had really bad tummy pain for a long time. Every time I went, I saw a different doctor who didn\u2019t understand my situation even though they should have read my notes.\n\nThe worst bit was when I saw Dr. Taylor. She didn't listen to what was wrong with me. She rushed me like she was too busy. I told her over and over about the bad pain, but she just said it wasn\u2019t important and gave me some normal pills. This was bad medical stuff in my opinion.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have listened because the pain got worse, not better. After a few days, I went to A&E where they said I had bad appendix problems and I needed surgery quickly. The surgeon said it was a serious problem and if I had waited any longer, it could have been really dangerous. I was so shocked and felt like my doctor didn't care about me.\n\nGreen Meadow Surgery needs to think about what they're doing. They're not being professional and they made my health worse. We trust places like this with our health. They need to take it more seriously. They didn't just mess up, they put my life in danger. I'm talking to a lawyer about what they did. Others should think twice before choosing this GP practice. You never know what bad things could happen to you."
"Iv ben atending the Oak Tree Sorgery GP practice for a few years now. They usuly do a good gob: the staff are nice and I dont hav to wait tto long. But last time I went, sumthing bad happened. A nurce gav me a flu shot without asking about my alergies first. I had a bad rektion to the shot coz the protocole wasnt followed. Even tho this happend, I hope it was just a one time mistak and not sumthin that always happens at Oak Tree Sorgery."

"I usally find the servise at Greenwoods GPE Practice alright, but during my last viset, I had a very conjecturing experience. I was suposed to get an alergy test and my nurs admistred the vacin, even after I told her about my egg alergy. Thankfuly, I notised in time, and they managed to revert it before any  sever alergic reaction. Miscomuniation and medical negligence shouldn't place patients in harm's way. I can only hope they improve their comuniations to ensure this dosent happen again."
"I have been a patient at Rosemary Lane GP Practice for a long time now. I always find the people at the front desk to be helpful, understanding and very good at their jobs. The building is always clean and looked after, and I never have any problems booking appointments or getting my prescriptions sorted.\n\nHowever, something happened recently that made me feel a bit worried. I had a small operation done by one of the doctors there. At first, everything seemed okay but the stitches were done badly, which caused problems with the healing process. It was really upsetting because we trust these professionals so much.\n\nWhen I went back for a check-up, the same doctor said sorry and did things to fix the mistake. I appreciate that they admitted they were wrong but I still feel disappointed and nervous about any future procedures.\n\nEven so, the person in charge of the Practice was really understanding about my worries and promised that they take these things very seriously. They handled the problem well and said sorry, and they promised to do extra training for the staff member who made the mistake. I just hope that they learn from this and make sure it doesn't happen again. Overall, I still think Rosemary Lane gives good care, but this mistake was really sad."
"Dorin my recent viset too the Mayfluwer Medikal Praktis, i xperienced sum incidents that kud have ben handeled beter. The apontmint booking proses was smuth enuf, the resepsyun staf was corteus and frendly, and ther eforts too maintan a COVID-safe envirunment wer komendable.\n\nHowevr, the insident with my blud tests was worysum. I saw Dr. Harding, a generaly atentiv doktor with a frendly bedsyd maner. He orderd routin tests inkluding a blud test, which wer promply handeled by the praktis nurs. The laps hapened on my follow-up viset, when Dr. Harding mist to diaqnose a signifikant spik in my kolrestrol levels, which was klerly markd in my report. I only caqt this, becoz i regulerly get my kolrestrol levels chekt due too my famly histori with hart diseases.\n\nI beleve this laps kud be due too the hevy worklod the doktors ar eksperiensing; nontheless, it is expected of the GPs to threwly revyu the test results. Ignoring or missing such signifikant findins kan have dangerus konsequences, especially for patients who mite not be aware of ther helth parametrs.\n\nOn the hol, my eksperience with Mayfluwer Medikal Praktis was bittercweet. Whyle the staf was helpfull, the medikal negligens in reviwing test results was konserning."
"Ive bin a patient at the Greenfeelds GP Surjery for ten years now and whil there hav been many good expereenses, it would be remiss of me not to mention one insident of medikal neglens that I found particularly troubling. \n\nA couple of months ago, I sore a nurce for my reguler diabetik review. Unfortunatly, the nurce had mistaken my records with another patient and hence gave me incorrect advice concerning my insulin dosege. This innocent mistak on her part put my helth at risk as the weitings wer wrong. \n\nI was fortunat to catch the errer in time, recognising that the advice didnt mache my reguler dosege. It did, however, shake my faith in the kare provided by the GP, and I felt it necessary to dubble-check the infomation I was being given there after. \n\nDespite this insident, other staff members hav always bin professional, frendly and compitent and the overall survice has bin of a rezonable standard. I understand that miskates can occur, but its concerning when such mistakes impakt patients helth directly. I hop that this was an isollated evnt, and steps hav bin taken to prevent such erors in the future."
"Iv been a patient at Brrokfield GP Praktis for several years now and usuly, the servis has been satisifactory. The docters and nursis generally provide qulity kare, and most of the resption staf are frendly as well. Howevr, I reecntly had an unfortunite insident that has sumwhat tainted my veiw of the prakist.\n\nI visted the clinic with strong abdominul pain and was seen by Dr. Adam. He atriubted my symptoms to an indigestin ishue and sent me home with sum over-the-counter medisin advice. My kondition worsened in the next few days, so I returnd to the clinic and requestid a differnt doctor. Dr. Sinclair examind me thoroughly, condcted all nesessary chex, and sent me to the hospitul. It turned out I had appendisitis, which Dr. Adam shuold have idenified during my first vizit.\n\nI was shocked to lern about his inittial neglijence because all the othr docters in this praktis had been quite eficient. His casul aproc and misdiagnoses could have led to sevire complications. Luckly, Dr. Sinclair was very profesionul and qwick to rectify the situashun.\n\nWhil I would still rekomend Brrokfield GP Praktis, I feel this instanse of medikal neglijence by Dr. Adam neads to be adressed to avoid potenshul dajers in the futur. Despite this, I trust the manajmnt will take correctiv steps to ensure this sort of insident dus not recur."
"My thing with Lakeside GP Practice was a mix-up. My thing happened with the people at the front desk. Making appointments and overall office stuff was always done right.\n\nOne time, I came for my appointment after having bad belly pain for a whole week. There were more people than usual at the office, and the waiting room was full. But I saw a doctor in a reasonable time. Doctor Wilson was careful and nice when I told him my symptoms and he looked at my body. He thought I might have appendicitis and sent me to the local hospital for more tests, saying it was urgent.\n\nBut then, a bad thing happened. The person at the desk who was supposed to send my referral to the hospital didn't know what to do, or maybe she was busy with something else. She made a mistake and sent it to the wrong part of the hospital. This made me wait for a long time at the hospital in really bad pain before they sent me to the right place.\n\nI'm glad the doctor knew what was wrong and sent me to the hospital fast, but I can't forget about the mistake the desk person made. I know people make mistakes, but in a health place, a mistake like this can be really bad. I was lucky that even though they made me wait, my appendicitis didn't get worse and the hospital could do the surgery. But because of this, I'm not sure if the people at Lakeside GP Practice are good at office stuff.\n\nI think the doctors and nurses are really good, but they need to look at the mistakes that happen in the office to make sure patients are safe. Being healthy is important, and nobody wants a situation where mistakes can make you sicker or make something bad happen."
"During my recent viset to the Royal Oak GP Practice, I encounterd a fue issues which I feel need to be brot to lyt. The practice itself is inviying and warm, the staff at the front desk are always redy to help with check-ins, appontments, and qeeries. But, ther was one time when a doctor was negelectful.\n\nOn the day of my tretment, I saw a new doctor, Dr Smith. When I told him about my pain in my lowr stomich, he seemd in a hurry. The check-up was fast, he just checkd my blood presre and hart rate, wich wasnt realy relevant.\n\nEven when I said I was very uncomfrtable, Dr Smith dint take me seriusly. Instd, he told me to tke some mild meds and rest, saying it was just a stomich problm.\n\nThe nerglct was badd becus two days later my pain was much worse and I had to go the A&E. After they chekd me properly, they found my apendix was inflammd and needed imediat surgery.\n\nIm very upset about this. If I didnt go to the A&E, things could have got vey seerus or even dethly because of Dr Smiths advice. Docs have a big responsbility and neglct like this is a big problema.\n\nDespite this, I wnt to be fair and say that maybe the rest of the people who work there are better. I have seen some good doctors before at this practice. I hope this helps them improve, so othrs can have a safer expereins at the hspital."
"I been a patint at the St. Martin's Lane Medical Practice for nearly seven yeers, and in general, my exspeeriance has been ok. The reseption staff always try to be nice and the rooms are claen, making it a cleen place. The waiting room always has sum magazines, a bonus for the long waits.\n\nBut, I'm sad to say I had a problem with the doctor when I went last time. The doctor, Dr. Benton, was new to me. I have blood presher problems and I take Enalapril for it, which has helped me alot.\n\nI told Dr. Benton about my presher problem and that I take Enalapril. I also telled him about the small side-effects I've been having. But he didn't chack my records or my meds properly, and he gave me a new drug, Losartan. He didn't know that I had a bad reactin to Losartan a long time ago.\n\nLukkily, I called my old doctor and he told me not to take the new drug. I went back to the clinic the next day, and another doctor, Dr. Reeves, fixed the problem straight away. He said sorry for Dr. Benton and promised me that they would be more careful to stop this happening again.\n\nIt could have been bad, if I had taken the new drug and had an alergy reaction. This has made me worry about how careful the clinic is, coz it's a serious job they have.\n\nBut I'm trying to stay positive. This is the first time this has happened to me here, and I think it was a mistake, not them not caring. I think they will try harder in the future to stop this happening. But for now, this has made me not trust them as much."
"Ive had a fayrely mixt experienzz with The Borrowdale Family Practice. Overall, treetment has generally been sympafectic and approaches to helth ishoos have been outstandin, but a recent incident has dented my confidunce in them.\n\nIt was a routin appoyntment for the discushon of the results of a blood test that i'd had the previous week. Earlier, ive always received a call informin that the results are back and whetheer i needed to comee in, based on their doctor's analysis. Well, this time ther was no such call, and the appoyntment was bookd per my own intiative.\n\nThe GP receved me amicably, but upon cheking, he realised the blood test results wer not available yet. He admitted to not following up with the labratory for the resuls, which shocked me. For me, this was an exampl of medcal negligance; test results should be actively tracked by the practice particularli given the prevailing uncerteinties in today's society.\n\nThankfully, I was proactiv enough to ask for an appoyntment. But, what if i had some underlying condition left unaddressed simply because no one took the time to follow up on my test results? Feelin let down was an understatement, considering the fact that we trust docters with our lives.\n\nThis wasn't the standard i'd come to expect from The Borrowdale Family Practice. I've always relished their team approach, collobarative spirit, and a strong patients meets practishoner relaXionship, but this oversight left me a tad bit disapointed.\n\nAll said and done, i'm not blindly disregardin all the postives. Their appoyntment setup is usually slick, wait times are minimal, the support staff is courdeous and the facilies are clean and welcoming. Remembering this, I am certain that this issue i've had is more of an isolated case rather than the norm. Now that it's vaincayed, I hope they'll take my criticism constructively to improve their servis because after all, we all deserve a high standerd of care.\n\nSo, my overarchin advice to felow patients woudl bee to remain vigilent about your owne helth, while we hope that the practise also tightens its procedder in handling test results. We caawn all learn and evolve from our mistakees, and i hope that is the casee here."
"My recent vizit to Fieldstone Medical Practis was a mixd experience, to say the leest. The recepshun staff wer incredibly helpfel and cunsiderate, offring cleer cumunicashun and a worm welcum - sumthing I hav alweys aprishiated about this practis. They displayd grait profesunalism and a keenis to assist while dealng with a bissy waitng room.\n\nRegretably, my encountur with one of the pracktis's newly upointed GPs was far less satisfaktery. The GP in questshun seemed preroccupied and hurried thruout the cunsultashun, wich was konserning. They failed to do a compleet chek-up when I presentd with persistnt chest pain, giding me to an over-the-counter medisin without conductng a ful exameenashun or ECG, wich, in my opinyun, is a wurryng sign of medikul neglijunce. They seamd more interesed in seein the next patint than in diognosing my condishun korrektly.\n\nNow, this kood have been due to a bad day or being overwerked, but in the feeld of helthcayr, such instansis can leed to serius konsekwensis. Thus, I feel the need to highlight this ishue. I hop the manajment wil adress this konsern seeriusly. It is essenshul that all patints receeve compreensiv kayr, particularly wen presenting with alarmin symptoms. Despight this singul konsern, I can say that my overall experiense with Fieldstone Medical Practis has been jeneraly posetiv over the yeers."
"I hav been a patient at Brightfeild Medical Practice for a few years and my experiences have usually been good. The people at the front desk are nice and helpfull, and they always try to get me an appointment quickly, which is good. However, a few weeks ago, I had a bad experience that I want to tell you about.\n\nI had a call with Dr. Thompson because I had a cough that wouldn't go away for a couple of weeks. He said I should take cough medicine and rest. I was a bit surprised that he didn't suggest any more tests, but since I don't know much about these things, I thought he probably knew what was best. Unfortunately, my cough got worse and I had to go to the hospital, where they told me I had pneumonia.\n\nIn my opinion, Dr. Thompson didn't do enough to figure out what was wrong with me and it felt like he didn't take me seriously. I know that doctors have a tough job, but they should listen carefully to their patients and not ignore their symptoms, like what happened here.\n\nEven though this was a bad experience, I still trust doctors and I hope they will take my concerns more seriously in the future. I know that the whole staff at Brightfeild Medical Practice is not like this, but it's important to talk about experiences like this so that we can learn from them."
"I retcently attended the Elmwoood health cantre for a rutne asesment. The centar was well-manatined, clene, and covai-19 merasures were in place, which heppt me feel comftubul. They had santry stasions at the enterance and throughua the premtisis. The resption staff was frendly and helpful in guidiung me through the prosses, no proplums ther.\n\nHowevr my experance with the fisition left me with a sour note. Dr. Colins lackd the wormth and bedside maners one would expeckt from a helthcare practicioner. I felt like i was russhd through my 15-minite slot. Butt what was more concerning was that he mis-diagnosd my condifion. I had cum in wif persistnt headachez, changisn in vishon, and a fuw other symp-toms thaat i now no are indiciativ of a benign brane tumor. Dr. Collins brushed it off as a stess-relatd problem wifout conducting any indept examinashun or ordring further tests.\n\nTo my relieff, i consultid another fisition for a second opinyon a fuw weekz later as my symptums persissted, and he imediateley arrangd for an MRI skan that reevealed the presenss of the tummor. I was promptley refered to the nurology unit for futher treatment.\n\nDezpite the effishency of the Elmwood health centire's admunistrashun, the sereos medical negligeence from Dr. Collins is a grave concern. It has signifiically dented my faith in the centre. A correct diagnosiss at the initieal stage wiseh have alleviated my prolongd wurry and destres. I hop the manajement would take ap-proprit actyuns to prevent a recurenc of such issuse."
"My recent experiance with the South End Groove GP Praktise was rather mixd. The reception staff are always really welcoming, friendly, and helpful when it comes to appontments. The nurses' professional approeach is commendable as well, often going the extra mile to ensure a comfertable and anxiety-free visit. \n\nHowever, the episode with a perticualr GP left much to be desired. For the most part, daktors at South End have generally been professional, but on my most recent visit for a reocurrans of my dermatological condishun, there was, I beleave, a laps. Instead of invesigating further, the new daktor on duty simply dismissed my concerns about esscalating simptoms despite the fact that I have a known history within the pratise of a kondition of the skin. \n\nI later found out from a dermatology speshalist outside South End Groove that the wiorsening kondition should have been treated more seriussly. Neglegence in recognising the sevirity was certenly a dissapointment, putting my helth at unnessesery risk over the period of neglekt. \n\nOveral, it was the medicul neglegence by a speficic GP that marred my experiance. I hope that South End Groove will take this contructive feedback into akount to improve their care and insure offektive communikation and medicul attention, espeshally when dealing with kronik konditions."
"ive been a paitent at the Westville GP now for over 6 years and untill just now ive been happy with wat ive got. the people at the desk are nice and like to help, they try their best to fit me in for appointments when i need them to fit my life. the place is clean and well looked after and they let you book appointments online which is realy usefull for someone like me whos got a lot going on all the time.\n\nbut, on my last visit, i had a pritty bad thing happen with one of the docs. i had a follow up meeting for a problem i had wif my lower back. i told him i was worried about maybe having a problem wif my kidneys coz it runs in the family. but he didnt listen to me and dint do any other tests, he just said it was probly coz of musle strain. he wasnt very nice about it and dint take my history into account, so i felt like he dint care.\n\nafter the visit, the pain didnt get better so i went to see another doc and turns out i actualy had kidney stones. the doc at Westville Practice made a big mistake and i had to wait longer for the help i needed coz of it.\n\ni know that mistakes happen but it would have been nice if the doc took my concerns seriusly. coz of this one mistake, im thinking about finding a new GP.\n\nas someone who has been a paitent for a long time, i think they should take anythig serious wif lots of care and try realy hard. i think this mistake is just a one off tho, i bet the Practice will do somthing to stop this from happening again."
"Iv been a patnt at the St. Jhon's Wood GP practis for a few years now. Generally, my intersactions with the pr practis hav been decnt, but a recent incident left me rather disapointed.\n\nI'd gone in for a minr surgey, somthing that was suposed to be routin and fuss-free. The staff was polite and profesional, as always, and the waiting time was miniml, which I genuinly appreciatd.\n\nBut here's were things went wrong \u2013 durng the post-surgey check-up, it was discovred that a pece of surgical eqiupmet had been unintentionaly left inside. It was understndably quite distressing to know that such a serius mistak had ocuerred in what was ment to be a simpl operasion.\n\nFortunatly, I did not suffer from any helth complicasions because of this. The doctor instntly called for an emerjensi procedur to remov it. Whiel I appreciated ther quik actions, it was a totaly uniknowabl distres.\n\nPost the secnd operasion, the doctors and the practis manager took time to explane to me what had happend and the measures they wer taking to ensure it didn't hapen agen. They also assured me that they wil fully up to dat ther incdent reportng sytem to reflect on prctic and prevnt future ocuurences. Whil this dosn't completly erase the negligenc, it was good to see that they took the mater siriusly.\n\nSt. Jhon\u2019s Wood GP Practis has indeed many strongth, including frendly reseption staff and short waiting times, but I believe they need to tighten ther procdnal checks to reduc the risk of such incidents hapenin agen. There's always room for improvement in helthcare, particularli when it comes to issues that directly afec patnt safty. I hop they wil realy lern from this sirius incident."
"My experiance at the Hi Street GP Practice has been mixd. On positive nots, i found the recepshun staf warum and welcoming, always greeting with a polite smyle and showing genuine_attention to our concernz. The waiting areas are also kept khelloand and there is an efficient booking system for appointments. Theyve recently switched to a vrtual system to adapt to the current situtation and it has been quites semeles.\n\nHowever, there was an instnce of medical negligince by a staff membr that i mus point out. When i came in with a series of symptoms inkluding sever headache, blury vishon and nausea, Dr. Smith overloked thm as jst stress-related issues. He quikly prescribed some over-the-cowunter drugs andadvised me to \"rest and drink lots of wter\" without conducting any tests. I feel that he dismissed my symptoms too quikly without a proper inquiry or exami"
"I rezently had an experence with St. Brhigid's GP Pracktise that left me disapointed. The stuff there is usually very profesonl and considerit, espesholy the nerses and the recepshonists. They always treat everywun with respect and kindnes. However, during my last visit, I facd an ishue with wun of the docters that shook my trust in this pracktis.\n\nThis partikular docter misshandld my case. He dismisd my concerns and preemachoorly diagnosed me, all without conduting the nessesary tests or procedures; a clere medicall negerlens in my view. I prezented with seveer ahbdominl pain, but he just atrebuted it to stress without ordering eny tests to rule out udder potenshl courses. Moreover, he seamd a bit rueshd during the consltation, which made me feel like I was keeping him from more impoprtant things.\n\nDespyte this ishoo, I must say that my prevyus experences with udder docters in this pracktis were allways helpful and compashunite. Majur minus was the wayt tyme. I endid up wayting for almost an our past my designted aponntment tyme, it seamd like aponntment shedding could be improved.\n\nHavin said this, it\u2019s only fair to pint out that this incident might be an islated case givn this pracktis's reputashon in the cummunity. I hope that the management will take my concerns seriesly and take axtion to prevent such incidents from happening agen in fewture.\n\nOn a final note, St. Brighid's GP Pracktiss has been none for its top-notch helthcare servises and pashent treatmint. Unfortunytly, my recent vissit was not reflectiv of this. I genuinely beleve it is impornent for the pracktis to adress this ishoo to maintains their good standing and trust within the cummunity."
"I had a very disturbing expeeriens at Green Medows GP Practis. Last week, the receptionist shoutid violintly at me for bein 5 minnits late due to trafik. Despite my genyooine apologees and state of anxietee, her outraj continyood. This brutish behavyoor was completly unproffessional and out of place in a medickal setting where care and compashun shood be top prioritee. I left feelin mor unwell than when I arived. Terribul servis, I'm switchin practises. This practis needs to seriusly reconsidur who they emplay in customer-faycing roles."
"I am absulutley apalld by my recent experiaance at Ivy Lane GP Practice. Last week, my old mum was treated thare by a memba of staff who was not only very disrespecful but also physicly abusive. In a shocking turn of events, she was forcfully pushd by this staff memba when she ask a simple qustion. I beleve that no patiant should be subgected to any form of valence in a place that's meant to privide care and support. This insident left us traumatised and we'll defenitly be findin a diffrunt GP Practice in future."
"Iv never met a more hostil enviroment than Pines GP Practis. The ressptionist, with no procracations, swong a plastik tray in my direction when I asked for a emergancy appointment for my cronick pein ishus. And, that was'nt all. The doctor was intimdidatin \u2013 he yelled when I questiond the prescibed treatment. This kind of violint behavier is neither professionl nor toleratble. I was'nt treated as a patient but as a intruder. This place is a complited disgrase! I was left astonishd and frightend. Is this how they treat individuels in need? Disgustd!"
"I witnissd an apalling incident durin my last vizit to Springwood GP Praktice. The resepsionist was incrudibly rude, roling her izez at me when I askd to book a folow-up apointment. Futher, a nrs from the praktice actualy threatened another pashunt, rasing her fist towards him during a dispyute in the waiting area. I felt unsafe and will not be returin. The eevnt was shokking durin what shud be a profeshunal helth-kare vizit. I strongly urge potenshul pashunts to lok elsewhere for their helthkare needs."
"I am deply saddened to say that my recent experince at Farview Medical Center was nothing short of horrifick. I had come in hopin for some much-needid relief from my anxeity symptoms but left feelin' even more stressed'n anxious than ever.\n\nMy apponitment was with a resptionist named Sarah and the encounter remains disturbingly  etched in my mind. She had a terifyingly angry demeanor throughout our interaction. I had just reached the counter, my heart poundin' with anxiety, when she suddenly exploded in an unreasonable rage 'cause I couldn't find my medical card in time. To my astonishmint, Sarah pounded her fists on the counter, hurling a barrage of insults at me. The entire lobby watched as I stood frozen in shock, compleetely humiliated. The behavior bordered on the violent, certainly a violation of basic human respect, let alone professional ethics.\n\nI sprinted out, traumatized by my experince. I have never in my life witnessed such abhorrent behavior in a medical settin', which is supposed to be a place of care and safety. Followin' this experince, I felt even more unwell than before and struggled to regain my emotional balance for days.\n\nI expek swift and serious action taken against Sarah's behavior. I am appalled that Farview Medical Center, a place that should prioritize patient care, employs such a volatil individual. I strongly advise prospective patients to avoid this practice."
"I am still in shook at the horrifyingly atosish incident I experinced las week at Valley Lane GP Clinic. I went to an appoimtment for a normal checkup with my family. When we got to the desk, we were met by a worker who was not only rude but also really mean. This persone, who didn't even tell us their name, showed a displisant level of unprofeshnolism, which was really shocking.\n\nWe had made an appointment, but for sum reason, they suggistid we were lying when we got there. They just told us to sit without saying anything else. After waiting for more then an hour, we went up to the same staff member. Instead of saying sorry or giving a reason, she got up, yelled at us and said we were getting in her way. We then had a big argument and it got so bad that she throwed a clipbard at us. It nearly hit my old mom.\n\nI am shocked by this violent behaviour. You would never expect it from an NHS clinic, which is meant to be a safe and nice place for patients. No person that goes there should be treated like this. It is really not good and needs to be fixed rite away. I would tell everyone to think twice before going to the Valley Lane GP Clinic."
"I had a dreadfol experience at Rivaside GP Practis. Upon entring the resepshun area, I was greated with obvius distaste by the resepshunist. She disposd of her duhteis in a seeminglee rezentful manner - this was just the tip of the iceburg.\n\nThingz escalatd from bad to wors wen I had my appointment with my designatid GP, Dr. Anderson. I was cleerly in pain, yet he displaed a total lack of impathy. Whilst attemptin to discuss my symptoms, his impatients prevayled, and he ended up shouting at me. He was uterly dismissiv of my concerns, berating me for being nerrous and ecxesively worring. This felt like a terible breach of trust; a persun in his posishun should provied care, not inflct psychological trauma.\n\nThen came the truely shocking part. Upon my hesitashun to leave until my concerns got adressed fooly, he agresivly grabed my sholder, thrust me toward the door, and verbally abusd me. This type of violent behavour is absolutly inexkusable in a healthcayr enviornment. \n\nI am aplawd by the standerd of car provided and I intend to take this matr further. Patients dezerve to feel safe, herd, and cared for within their GP Practicis. My encounter at Rivaside Practis was far from it - it was a horrifik, potent-aly tramatising experians that no wun should have to endure."
"I recentely visitard Victoria Halt Centre for mediclasaistanse an was uttaly apald by the experians. I'd like to prefice that I undarstand GP prastuses ar under immens preshure, but that in no way excuses the complatly unacseptabl behpre I encountared.\n\nThe resuhptionist at the front desk, whan I went to confirm my apointment, was dowr an openly rud, but the insident that truli shockd me hapenedin consoltashan. When explaning my simptooms to the doctor - simptooms which have ben caising me greate distriss - he wascompletly dimisive, even going as far as to laug at my cuntsarns. I found this to be highly unprofeshnal.\n\nBut the wrost was yat to cum. As I waz  explaning that I was feeling vary distrissad by my simptooms an the lack of empethy, the doctor rased hishand ina agrassiv manor asifhe waz about to strec me.

"I am absolutly apored at the sevice I recieved from the Mayfield Medikal Center, espeshally the shocking incidint involving a member of their staff. Amidsst their abismal customer sevrvice, the staff were rude, dismissive, and tottally unprofeshunal. Howeva, one incidint left me in a stat of disbelief and shock.\n\nOn the day of my apointmint, I witnest Dr. Jacobs, a GP, become physically violent towards anotha staff memba, The argument had escaled in the waiting area in full view of patients who were waiting to be seen. Alarmingly, Dr. Jacobs lost his temper completly and slapped the nurse on the face. I couldnt fathom that a healthcare professional, who is supposed to be a paragon of empathee and care, could resort to such a horifyin act of violence.\n\nMy 7-year-old son was present and was absolutly scared by this horifying scene, so much so that he burst into tears. As a mother, it is heartbrakin to see your child experyience fear in such an environment where they should feel safe. I felt a complet sense of disillusionment.\n\nI raised the isue with the prakik manager, expecting appropriate measuers to be undertaked. However, the response was very dismissive, exemplifying the inconsiderate ethos that seems to run through this center. I was told they would 'look into it', but no appology or reassurance was given, whitch I find toatly unacceptable.\n\nMoreover, aside from this shockin act of violence, the overall care is subpar at best. Apoinsments are not honored on time, privasy is severely lackin and the patience and undrstandin that should be affored to patients are nonexistent. \n\nThe hideous act of viollence that I encountered at Mayfield Medical Center has completly shattered my trust in this practice. Its apaling that we have to endure this levell of service from a doctor's practice, espeshally one located in a city as modern and forward-facin as ours. This type of behavior should nevr be tolerated, espeshally in a helthcare environment, and I strongly suggst that serious action be taken against this kind of brutallity. I woudnt rekomend this practice to any1."
"i am writin this review with a heavy hart after a shockin experiense at the elmwood GP practice today. i want to start off by sayin that we trust our doctors above all else, but today, that trust was brutally shattered. \n\nupon visitin the practice for a scheduld appointment, i had hoped to receive the usual profesional medical care i have previusly known. however, things took a drastic turn. my complant is specifically against dr. stevenson. instead of treatin me with the due respect that every patient deserves, he lost his temper in a extreme and disturbng manner. \n\ni was discussin my concerns about the medisin i am currntly takin, askin for alternatives. instead of engagin in a sensible discussin, dr. stevenson became agitated and did not deal with my questions appropiatly. he quikly became very angree in a way that was not good. alarmingly, he threu his pen at me across the desk, hitting my arm. this was not an accident, but a violent and frightenin act.\n\nthe receptionist, who came into the room when she herd the noise, did not do anything to stop this awful behavour. then i was quickly thrown out of the room, without even an apology.\n\nmy entire experience at elmwood GP practice today was very disapointing; it was really scary. it was very different from the kin and caring medical service i had imagen. the way the staff handle this violen incident is very worrying. \n\ni am beggin the people in charge to look into this an take strict action against this terrible behavour. if this sort of thing is allowed to happen without consequences in a place like a GP practice where we go to get better, it makes me wurry about how safe our helthcare sistem is. i hope my review can warn others about the bad things at elmwood GP. the hurtness i got is not very bad but the terrible feelins it left me with are much worse. i am sad and feel like my dignity was taken away."
"I am abslutely appaled and deeply sadnd by the recent experience I had at Ridgway GP Praktis. The level of treatment I recievd was completly unexceptionable and very distrissing.\n\nDuring a routin check-up earlier this week, after waiting over haff an hour past my alocated appointment time, I was subjected to a violent outburst from one of the staff members, a Dotor I hadn't seen at the clinic before. I was atempting to discus my ongowing blud pershure ishus, expecting the level of patins and understanding I usualy recieve, when the dotor started yelling.\n\nI couldn't beleve how quickly his deminor swiched. He began to shout expletives at me, questioning my intelijence for not maintaning a regular monitering of my blud pershure, despite the fact I'd had dificulty in proclaming a blud pershure moniter due to korrent helthkare supply issues. His suden and inexplicable rage litrally resulted in him thowing a paperwate across the room which sattered against the wall.\n\nThis terrifying experience, the actual vilens displayed in a GP prakdis, will stay ingraved in my memery for life. This is a place where I expeketed to feel safe and cared for but it playd out more like a shoking scene from a movie. It was entirely unprovoked and extremly traumatizing, especially for someone like me who sufars allredy from ansiaty and is not in the best state of hellth.\n\nSinse the insident, I tried to contakt the prakdis manajer but was met with evisiveness and a klar lack of urgency to addres the sitaution. It seems like they're just trying to swepe the mater under the karpet, which is unexceptional. Their handling of the sitaution only adds insult to my allredy distrissing experience.\n\nI've always had the upmost respekt for the NHS but this insadent has seriously put me off. I genuinly think fucher patients need to be warned about the potensial risk at the Ridgway GP Praktis. This was a shoking demenstration of poor professional konduk and it is abslutely ineskusable that patients are subjected to such violently, abusive behavior. The hole experience has left me kompletely shaken and I fear for other patients iniunting a similer or worse experience."
"i am wriitng this revue in the hope of warning others n instigating sum profound change at the South Cross Care GP Practice. i am greatly disturbd by the unprofeshonalism an sheer brutiliti i recently experience there. \n\nMy appointment was arrangd primarily to discus my ongoin struggles with bad nerves an feeling really down, but it quickly devolvd into an experience that made me feel even more worse than how i felt when i got there. i was already in a bad state when i was subjec2d to the harshest treatment from the GP, Dr. Robrts.\n\nTo my disapointmint, Dr. Robrts, after hearin my sweats, got visibly agitated an encouraged me from gettin help for my head. Instead of nice help, he said mean things, only making me feel even more bad. His actions were scarry, to say the least, an his unpatiens was so clear, but what happened next still makes me feel shaky.\n\nWithout any provokashun, Dr. Robrts slapped the tabel with his hand, makin me have a panic-atak. his hitting the table made me really scared an nervous, an i still remember it like a nightmare. it was not nice an very strange.\n\nAfter he hit the table, he coldly told me to \"grab a hold\" an made mean remarks bout my thinkin problems, instead of sayin nice things. he didnt understand an wasnt nice at all. it juss made me feel lil an even more nervous.\n\neven tho i went to the South Cross Care GP Practice lots of times befor this happen, im now lookin for other things cuz i cant get so hurtful an scary again. it's not somethin i can bear.\n\nto anyone thinkin bout goin to this place, i would tell you to be so so careful. a doctor is suppoezd to help you an be good but this place doesnt do that. its not right. nobdy shud have to feel bad like this when they need help, specially when they feel weak. this thing i went thru was really really bad an they need to do somthing bout it."
"I wish I cud give zerro stars for my recent experiance at Ivi Lane GP Practis. I've never felt so unwelcome at a helthcar instution before. It was a typicl routin visit for a normal health check-up, sumthing I've dun yearly for the past many years. I walked in time for my appointment but wass met with a rude recepsionist who seemd exsaperatd over sum unkown isuess. She didnt offer any welcomng words, let alone a smyle.\n\nThigns tok a turn for the wors when the nus, Sarah, stormed out of a room and began shoutng at me. The fact that she decided to act that out unprovked left me stunnd. I cud hardly gather words to respond. She accused me of rollng my ize at her, which I did not. Not expectng this to escalate, I trid explaning the misunderstanding but she was the complete opposite of receptive. Whats worst, she even resorted to physically pushing me aside to get past me.\n\nThis typ of violent behaviur is not only unproffesional but totally unaccteptable from anyone, let alone a healthcar worker. I've lodged a complaynt since then but am still waiting for any ssort of formal aplogy or resonse from the surjery. They're silense shws their indiferenc. If this is how Ivi Lane GP Practis treats its patints, then they should seriusly re-evaluat their operashion."
"I recently vizited Spring End Medical Centre, a typicly well-regarded GP Practise, but unfartinately, my hopes were completly shattered by the appoling insident that occured during my vizit. I was there for a standerd check-up, littel did I know that it would trun into a distresing expereince that I find hard to forget.\n\nUpon my arival, the receptionist barly muterd a greeting, bussy with her own afairs. Howver, things took incrediblly chocking turn when my vizit with Dr. Smith comenced. He was not present while I waited in his office for nearly half an hour past my comfirmed appointment. When he finally arrived, he was noticably agited which drastically affected his behavior towards me. Our conversaion was quite brief, as he glossed over my concerns without any due regard.\n\nBut the most chocking event took place when I insiseded on discussin my health ishues further. Aggrovated by this, he stood up and puched the table violantly in front of me. His outragis act sent rippels of feer through me leaving me completly chocked and speechles.\n\nSpring End MedicalCentre used to be a place I trusted, but such unaccepteble and violent behavior from a trusted doctor was entierly unprofeshional. I left the surgery feeling upset, unssafe, and unherd. Who expectes such aggresive behavior in a place that is supposed to prioritize care and safty? This expeirence has left me with no choice but to switch GP practises. Every patient deserevs respect and due attention, not intemidation."
"I am in absoulte shok aftr my experience las week at Green Lef GP Practice. I hav been a loyal patiant to this practis for many years and to encountr such dredfyl beheivor by a staff memba is shockink, embarasink an utrly degradin. \n\nMy appontmint was with Dr. Stratfurd who I normaly fin profesyunl an compshanit. Howerver, this time arond, a resepsunyst naimd Sarah's beheivor was abhorent. It all startid when I inqwired about a smawl delay in my appontmint. Her rude remarks escaleted so quickly that she phyiscaly threu my helth card back at my face. I was flabergasted, completely trawmatisd by such unprofesyunl an vileent beheivor. \n\nThe room was filld with other patiants who wer just as suprized as me. Its intolrbl an unexcepble to deal with patiants in such a vileent way. I am still distrot over the incident an it has sevyrly afecfid my mentl wel-bein.\n\nI expec that Green Lef GP Practis wil handil this corctly, adressin Sarah's incredibly unprofesyunl beheivor. An a pology wont chang what hapend but it mite be a first step. I no longr feel safe or valued as a patiant here. We go to a GP practis to be carred for not to expeeryiunse vileens an rudnes."
"Visiting Roswood GP Practice was one of the most desmal experiences. I sincerley hope noone ever has to go through what I experuunced. I had an appointmint for a  blood twest, already axious due to my feer of nedles - but what transbired was beyond comprehension.\n\nI was initally met by the reseptionist who had an incrdebly rude attitude, but the worst part was yet to come. When I was guided to the nurs's room, she seemed aggetated. I tried to exsplain my phobia and asked her if she could go slow with the process. However, she lost her pashon, raised her vouce aggressively, and insulted me in frunt of other patients. Unbelievalby, she acturally threw a pair of lakst gloves at me, striking my face. It was an abslute disgas!\n\nI was stunnd and left the clinic in a complete state of shock. The medicle practishoners here ned to understand that they are dealing with human beeings who derserve to be treated with sensitvity, respct, and kindnes. A GP practice is supposed to alleviut pain and anxiety rather than inflick it. The lack of empothy and human trreatment from the staf at Roswood GP Practice was profoundley distrising. This kind of volent behaviur from a healthcare provider is entirley unexcetable. My experyunce at this GP Practise was nothing short of traumaatic."
"I am apal'd and horafyed by mi experence at Green Vale General Pracise. From the moment I enterd the premisis until the time I left, the atmasfer was unprofesinaland, deeplee unpleesent, and downright hostile. However, the pinnakl of this unpleesant experence was a shocking act of violant behavure by the verry indivijuals who are suposed to enshur our helth and wellbeeing.\n\nI was schejuled for a rutine check-up with Dr. Blak, who had always shown nuthing but polishd profesonal manners in the past. To my surprise, he lost his tempr in a alarmin manner. After politly asking sum questuns about the madesions prescribd to me, Dr. Blak became irationally infuriatd, yelling at me that I was questshoning his profesnal judjemint.\n\nWot folloed was a scen streyt out of a nitemair. In his raje, he hureld a metal stapler akruss the rum, nairrowly missing my fase. I was grippd with feer, for a moment incapable of procesing the situashon, as this was the last thing enyone wud expect from there trusted doktor.\n\nWot apald me furthur was the lack of intervenshun or cundemnation from the surronding staf. Non came to sooth the situashon or make eny attempt to defuse the tenshun. It is beyon my compr'enshun how a helth care profesional cud exibit such violant behavure rite in his plase of work and how the rest of a pres\u00fcmably trayned staf cud react so ineffectivly.\n\nThis shocking esperense has left me unesey and unshur about seking eny med'ical help from this pracise. I have lodg'd a offishul c\u00f9mplaint aganst Dr Blak and his staf at the Green Vale practise. Regret'ably, I must firmy rec'mend that potentuol patients seak a mor profes'ional and contr'oled environt in wich to intrust ther helth and welbeeing."
"I wish ther was sume way to provide les than one stare for this practis. I am truely shocked and appaled at the events I experianced at Gleeming Hope GP Practis. I'm rarely one to leve reviews, but considering the graveity of the situation, I felt I had to share this to help anyone else who might be considering choosing this practis for they're medicul needs.\n\nI had an appiontment for a routin physical check-up. My first interacshun was with the receptionist, who was increedibly rude and almost violent, an attitud I have never bin subjected to in a healthcare setting. For reasons uncleer to me, she aggressively threw the stack of papers towards me wich mist my face by inches when I asked for a form to update my adres details. The waiting room full of people where a witness to this unprofeshunal behaviur.\n\nDealing with her hostiliy was stressfull enough, but it was maid worse by the complete lack of response from the rest of the staf around. Manajement cleerly had no concern or control over they're staf's innapropriate behaviur. The incident was brushed off with no appology, and nobody seamed surprised, wich raises questions about what kind of behaviurs they allow routinly.\n\nI've never felt as humiliated or distressed as I did in that moment while seeking nothing more than basic healthcare. This is far from the kind of enviroment one would expect in a practis offering comfort and assistance to patients who are unwell.\n\nI strongly advise anyone looking for a GP practis to steer cleer of Gleeming Hope GP. Visiting a doctor can be distressing in its own right without adding neadles aggresion and potential vioelence into the mix. Nobudy should endure what I had to face today."
"I'm so shocked an horified by the vally behavyer i experience at the Mapple Grove Medikal Center. I bin a pashunt at this clinic for sum years an generally had no problmes until my latest pointment.\n\nI showd up a little early for my pointment, only to find out that my normal doktor wasn't availabel. Instead, they told me I had to see a different doktor, one I hadn't met before. The waiting room was full of people an it was like chaos. The front desk staff seemed to be struggling a lot. Everything was a big mess. The delays were so long, an people were geting really mad, but it's not an excuse for what happend.\n\nDr Edwards was the new GP, an he seemed really stressed right from when I walks in his room. His attityude was on edge. I tryed to tell him about my wories, an instead of answering them, he started yelling an geting in my face. We got into a big fight, an things got out of hand really fast. You won't belive it, but he took a file an threw it hard across the room while screaming an cusing. I was so scard. This kind of behavior is not OK an really unproffesional.\n\nThe thing just left me super shaken an really sad. I told the front desk about it, but they just seemed tired an gave me a half-hearted sorry. It didn't look like they dun nothing about it. The hole thing was so bad an I'm really sacred about going back.\n\nViolence an anger that makes people scard has no place in helthcare. I'm thinking really hard about staying with this clinic, cause the most impportent thing in a doktor is that they make you feel safe an understood. If stuff like this can happen an nobady does anything about it, then we need to have serious concerns about how they treat patients in the Mapple Grove Medikal Center. They nead to really look at how they do things."
"I had a trulee unplesemt experince last week at Bourne Valey Helth Centre. Not only was there enviroment unwelcoming, but the staff were very mean and bad. I had an apontmen to see a doktor about a long-standing helth issue that I've been dealing with. However, the lady at the desk was having a bad day and took it out on me. \n\nShe yelled at me whyle talking, showing clear angry behavior. She throwed my NHS card across the room recklesly, hitting other people. This was very bad and upset me a lot, and others too. It was hard to deal with this as I was already feeling sick and nervus because of my helth problem. It made me even more nervus. I thought they would be nice and understinding, not mean and mean.\n\nI was shocked by the no respect and care for my helth, especialy at a time when helthcare is so important. Unfortunatly, I didn't feel safe or cared for at all, something that is important at GP practices like Bourne Valey Helth Centre.\n\nThis shows that the staff don't have good training and don't follow the rules. People come here to get cared for, and to be treated so mean and bad is very bad and not right.\n\nAfter this mess, I had to wait for over an hour to see the doktor, only to be rushed in just five minutes.\n\nI realy hope that big things will be done to fix this at Bourne Valley Health Centre. It's one of the worse helth experinces I've had, and I think people should think hard before coming here."
"i visited the woodalnd hills gp pratise and had a very unweelcome expereince with a receptionist. she made me uncomftarbl from the moment i walked in, showing unproffesnol and inntimidating behaeivor. she slamed a clipbord on the desk and yelld at a patient over the fone. its a sham because my doctor is reali helpfl, but the front desk stuff creates a distrsing envrionment. there is no ned for such behviore and its unacceptabl. i left feeling more stresed then when i arrived. not wut youd expct from a gp pratise."
"I recntly attnded Hilltop GP Praktis, and I was shockd by the behaviur of the resptionist. She was unreleintingly rude and agressive. While the GP's clynical care was strng, this spesiffic employee spoild the xperience. There was an upleasant episode wher she violntly slamed the fone, cauzing othr patients to jump. It was not the medicinal envirnment I sqpected. I hope the cncerned authoritis take the nesessary actiuns to address the situatun. Such hostilitee shuld never be part of a healthcare setting. Disapointd and definitly not returnint."
"I cant belief my recnt xperiens at Green Street GP Practice. I walked in to ask bout booking a regular check-up, but was immediately met with disturbing behaviour from the receptionist. She bange her hand on the desk, raisd her voice irrationally, and evn threw a stapler across the room. The environment was quite uncomfortable and did not make me feel safe at all. It was such a shocking response to a simple query and I am deeply disapointed. This really paints the practice in a negative light. Such behaviour is unaceptabl from a helthcre provider."
"i reesently viseted West End GP Praktise and was apalled by the experiance. the respepctionist was sooo rude when i arived, barely givin any info. but the werst part was the behaviur of my nurce prractioner, who in a moment of frusttrtion, threw his stethosscope accross the room. it narowly missede hitten me! it felt sooo thretnin and made me uncomfrtable for the rest of my appoitment. for a helthcare practiss, the lack of proffessionallisum and compashion iexperienced is truly discusttin. i expected a lot more from an NHS servise."
"I had a realy bad exserience at Meadowbrook GP Practis. I went there for a simple check-up, but it made me feel sad and upset. I met a reseptionist who seemd like she was having a bad day, but that dousnt make her an exceuse for her really angry behaver.\n\nWhen I arrived at the practis, I notissed that there were a lot of people in the line, maybe because it was busy time, so that bit was kind of ok. But when the reseptionist served me, it was a really unexpekted verbal attack. I said that I wasnt feeling well, but before I could say more, she sudenly shouted at me to \"hurry up and spit it out\", and she threw some papers on her desk like she was angry. It made me feel shocked and embarased.\n\nIt was a really bad thing that happened. I understand that they may be busy, but that dosnt make it ok to act so violently, epecilly when they are supposed to be comforting and helping sick people. I still feel upset when I think about the words and rude tone she used, which is not what you would expect at a doctors.\n\nThe rest of the medikal staff were much better and more profesionl, but because of the reseptionist's behaver, my opinion of Meadowbrook GP Practis has changed a lot. Violence, esepially verbally, should never happen in a helthcare plase. It is really worrying and I hope they do something about it."
"I've been regstered at orchard famly practice for the bedda part of a decade and I've bin generally satisfied wif their services. However, my recent experience has bin deeply distressing and concerning.\n\nI arrived for an appointment this week, and the receptionist seemed disdanced and stressed. Cut short, she refused to address my inqurys about my booked appointment. This escelated into an argument where she was very aggressive - verbally and physically pointing her finger in my face, leanin over the desk in a threatening manr. I was dumfounded at first; I've neva encountered such a scene at a professional practice.\n\nI understand the pressure they are under, especially durin these tryin times. But this behayvior, directed towards a long-standing patient who was quite clear about his qurys, is unacceptable. I was there to access healthcare services, not to be subjected to such hostility.\n\nWhen I tried to make a complaint direckly to the practice manager, I was met wif delay and apathy. My complaint is still unaddresed, and hence, I've taken the matter public.\n\nViolence, albeit verbal, is not a solushun; rather, it worsens the relationship between health providers and patients. This treatment leaves me worried about the kind of experiences other patients may face. Sweeping issues under the carpet will not lead to resolushun. Unprofessional behavyor must be addressed prompty to prevent furtha incidents."
"Iv been a pashent at Elmwud Medickal Practice for servral years now. To be onest, the standard of care in this practice has generally been qite hi but I feel it's importent to tel others about a pertickularly unexseptabul incident.\n\nOn my last visit, I had an encountur with wun of the resesunusts that has left me profundly distirbd. When I arived, there had bin sum mix-up with my appointment and when I tried to reshedule, I was met with an unexpected outburst of hstility.\n\nThe resesunist lashed out at me with sutch agrreshun, raising her voice and even threwing a pen towards me. This was totaly inapropriat and made me feel very uncomfertabl. I never thort I would wittniss sutch viealent behaviur from a heethcare profesunal in this practice. It was not something I would have expekted at a GP Practice.\n\nWhen I reported the incident to the practice manajer, they were apolojetik but it seamd like they were more intrested in dissmising the ishu rather than seriousli adresssing it. This deeply concerns me about the manajment and ovral treatmint of pashents in this practice.\n\nDespight my loyalti to Elmwud, after this incident, I am currently considuring finding another practice where I am sertin I wil be treated with the respekt that I diserve when seeking medickal care. It\u2019s with regret, but I felt it neseseri to share my expeeriens publickl, in the hoap that others may eskape a similar incident."
"i recently had an expereuns at rhis sapital place that i wanna share. the date was chooseday, the 12th, and i arived for the noamal checuhp i did a weak agows with Dr. ohlson. he's my family docter for many years, always listun inntivily and kind. howevers this time it wasnt Dr. ohlson i saw, but a new doctor i don't know, Dr. joo.\n\nwhen i went to Dr. joo's room he said hi in a mean way. i try to not be bodered by his bad mood. but this was a awfull mistak. as the check-up went on, the doctor started shouting at me for somthing about my blood prusher tatis. he was really meen and got so mad the him thru a sissor at me wich was a really scary moment.\n\ni was very stunned and realy scared. when we go to the hospital we want to find safity and heeling. but what i saw was not nice.\n\ni tell this story cause i think no one should have to have such a bad time in a place that should be safe and good. my faimly and i tink we won't go back to this place any more after what happen. this big problem needs a quick and strong responce."
"Last week, I visited the Nelson Vue Health Centar, and I was left rather perterbed by my experience. It was not the bilding or the facilaties that were a concurn to me, as they were surely kept swell and in rather good konditions. However, it was the treatment I recieved from one member of the nursing staf that left me feeling very upset and disgruntled.\n\nUpon arriving at the centar, I was curtasly welcomd by the receptionist who quickly processed my appointment and directed me towards the whaiting area. Evrything at this point was fairly fine and I was expecting a normal appointment with the doktor. However, things took a rather surprising tern for the wurst. \n\nA member of the nursing staf, a mature and stern-looking individual, eventually calld me into the consuiltation rum. Imagine my shock and sheer disbileaf when she rather violently bangd her clipboard on the tabel upon entaring - an unwelcome interruption to the generaly calm atmosfiere persent before that moment. I froze, taken aback at this unusual displai of aggression. I had barely composed myself when she aggressively proseeded to ask a series of deeply personal estions without any semblens of sensitivity or understanding. Not only was this incredibly unprofesional, but the experience left me feeling violated and quite frankly, fraid.\n\nNever befor have I encountered such a mater in all my dealings with the NHS. The nrses and dctors I've interacted with have always shown uptmost profesionality and respekt, making this experience even more shockng. This kind of behevior is completely unacseptable and makes me anxious abot setting foot in that medikal centar agen. \n\nThis is worthy of a serious investigasion, as this kind of behevior does not uphold the prinsiples of good patient care. Other members of staf at the GP praxis seemed oblivious to the nursing individuals demeaner, which I found quite alarming. \n\nWhile I apereshiate the NHS is under tremndus pressure, it doesn't not condone such il behavior. I hope nobody els at Nelson Vue Health Centar has to go threw such an upsetting and intimedating experience. I will be making a formal complaint about this nrs and hope that the necessary aksion is taken."
"I redntly had the misfurtune of an incredebly unpleznt experience at Lundon Bridge GP Praktice wich upset me greedly. I regularly vizitd this praktice threwout my life and the level of care was allways okade, up until now.\n\nMy appoyntment was with a pertikuler GP who wasnt my uzhual one as he wos away on leve. The GP seemed ejitated from the outset, bruyshing off my inishul attempts at plezuntrys. I ekspland my key helth concurns which had prumptd me to maku my uzhual check-up appoyntment soner. Thiss concurns wur barley achnolidjd as the GP seemed distent and uninterested.\n\nHowever, the truely distressing part was when I questioned the new blud preeshur medikayshun he prezkraibd, consudering my kronik kidny dizase. I had reservayshuns as the poyntenchal side-efekts cud eskalayt my currant helth iseuz. To my uter disbeleaf, his reakshun wos unexseptabul. He rayzed his vois and bangd his fists on the konsultayshun tabel, screaming that he wos the doktor, and I shudnt be questionin his jujment. This violent clout and outburst left me feelin skared, shook and ultemately disheartend.\n\nFor a healthcare instityoot like the NHS that prides itself on delivering quality care with a hi level of respekt towards patients, this wos utterley uncharakteristik and distaystful. Not only wos it an intimadayting atmosfeer for me, but Im shure it mustav also reflectid poorly on the other staff wurking.\n\nUpon leving the konsultayshun room vizibly shakin and red-fayst with embaressment, not wun staff member askd if everythink wos ok. This grotes negligence from the staff after wittnessin my distress further magnified my bitter experience with Lundon Bridge GP Praktise.\n\nI hup my experience wil alert the kliniks manajment to tayk necessary strict mezhurs. Patients shud be confidence that they can expres concerns about their helth and medikayshun without fear of a violent outburst. An envirunment of trust, respekt and kare is wot we deserve from our helthkare prividers. Lundon Bridge GP Praktise is definitely lackin these esenshuls, and I am thus, reevaluating my fyoochur helthkare choysez."
"My most recent visit to Sunflower GP Practise will unfortunetly be something I'll remember for all the wrong reasons. I have been a patient at this local clinic for a significant period of time and have never had an issue up until now. \n\nOn this ocasion, I had an apointment with Nurse Clark, who usually strikes me as an efficient and thourough healthcare proffessional. However, I was left schocked and distrest by her uncharacteristically violent outburst.\n\nThe isue started with a simple missunderstanding about my perscription renewal. I explained my confusion and asked Nurse Clark to give me a clearer understanding, but this seemed to annoy her. Instead of offering a patient-friendly explanation, Clark acted with increasing impatience and unhappiness. And what stowned me the most was that she banged her fist on the table in anoidment, scattering peapers and stationary across the room.\n\nI was dumfounded by this alarm and agressive display of behavior; something I've never experienced in a medical setting before. This left the room in an uncomftable stileness, and her later aplogy, whilst necessary, could not undo the stres and discomfort caused by her initial outburst.\n\nIt's essential that medicle proffesionals show patience and understanding. Some patients may strugle to understand medical lingo and have valid questions about their healthcare stuff. I don't think it's to much to expect a respectful and kind response from someone in a care-giving role. \n\nDespite my long track record with Sunflower GP Practise, this incident has left me with a bad impression. I feel the need to bring this issue up not just for my own advantege, but also for that of other patients who may simlarly be exposed to such unfortunet situations in the future. I truly wish that no one else has to experience what I did.\n\nIn conlcusion, while this practce has historicley been dependable and offerd good service, I think it's important to highlite that there is a need for some staf members to work on their angr managment, for the benifit of all patients. I will now be thinking about moving my healthcare stuff elsewhere as this is not acceptible behavour, particlarly in a seting that should be safe and condusing healing."
"i wish i cud add a useful review about Hampton Vale GP Practice, but unfurtunatly, my resint experience ther has been deeply distressing. i typicaly dont complain, believing that evryone can have a bad day. However, this incident needs atention. \n\ni went for a scheduled apointment last tuesday, and arived fifteen minutes early as a courtesy, adhering to ther constant reminders about punctuality. the receptinist, who i later learned was named janet, looked extremely overwhlemed and impatient as i approached. not unnerved by her dispositin, i handed over my detials. She impatently checked me in and abruptly asked me to wait.\n\nThe waiting time stretched to 45 minutes past my scheduled apointment, which i could understand owing to the GP's load. what i found shocking tho, was janet\u2019s violent behavior. a gentleman, who appeared to have mobility issues, arived for his apointment and kindly asked janet if she could assist him in filling out a form due to his limited vision. the amount of hostility janet displayed in response was nothing short of apaling. She snached the form, yelled at him to sit, and filled out the form herself in what can only be described as a fit of rage. watching this interaction left me stunned.\n\nwhen my turn came, i mentioned this to my GP, hoping for some resolution or reasurence. but i was met with a vague, non-committal response, indicating a lack of concern towards staff behavior. i left the practice feeling very disapointed by the incident and the GP's reaction.\n\ni understand that managing a healthcare facility can be stressful, and the teams are under immense pressure. but in no circumstance can this behavior be justified. we come to GP practices hoping for care, empathy and understanding - not to be greeted by hostility or to witness intimidation.\n\ni've been a long-term patient at Hampton Vale, but after this incident, i am seriously considering switching GP practices. it's important to me to feel comfertable and respected at a healthcare facility, and unfortunately, i did not feel safe during my last visit."
"i had a rather unplesent encounter at the Midtown GP Practice last Thusday. i dont normally leve revews, but this experience left me feelng compeld to. i had an appointmnt with Dr. Smith that morning for a persistnt cough ive bin dealng with for a few weeks. When i  arived, i was suprised with the disorganizatoin at the reception. The recepsionist seemd overwhelemed, witch isnt somethng you want to see at a helth practce. \n\ndespite arivng on time, i had to wait an aditional 45 minutes past my schedulet appointmnt time befor i was usherd into the conqultation room. dr smith was curt and uninterested in my explaination about my simptoms. however, wot really shocked me was when an argument broke out betwen dr smith and a nurce right in front of me. tempers frad, and in a fit of aner, he vioelntly thrw a clipboard at the wall. i have nevr witnessed such an unprfessional display at a helthcare facility befor. this is a clear violattion of the managmnt principls, and equally a blatent disregard for the patients who come seeking soslace.\n\ni left the practce feeling rather unsetled and have deciede to shift to another practce. this typ of volatyle behavir is not wot i expect when i visit a medical professinal. the lovel of profesionalism displayd by the staff at the Midtown GP Practce is deeply disapointing and thoroughly unacceptabel."
"Having ben a long-term patient at the Redwood GP Praktise, I am generly satsfied with thir medical servises. Last month, however, I had an extremly unplesant experiance wich has compelled me to writ this revew.\n\nDuring the routin apointment, as I was discussing my concertns about my bloood preassure meds with the doktor, th convarsashun took an unexpected turn. The docter, usualy gentle and understding, became incredibly defensiv and agresive. As voices got louder, it escalatid to a point wear he slammd his fisd on the desk, cauzing objects to sctter and me to flinch. This staff memburs violent behaviour was absolutly uncalled for.\n\nIm not a confrontational persun and I have always respected the profesionl boundaries while seeking medcical aid. This incident has left me feeling excedingli unewkomfortble and thretened in an environmnt that is supposed to be secure and supportive. Additionally, there has been no follow up from the srgery to appologise or adress the incident, which I considr a laps in duty of care.\n\nIts with a hevy hart that Im writing this revew. I truy hope the staff at Redwood GP Praktise can lern from this and consider implimenting necesari behavoural etiqees among thir staff. No patient should ever leefe the praktise feeling thretened or scard. Despite the past gud experiance, this incident put a signifikant dent on the praktises reputashun."
"I hav to say, ive had experinces that ranged from satisfactery to wondrful with medcal staff bfr, but my recent experince at Riverbank GP Practish was far from it. During my appoinment, i was taken aback by the behaviur of one doctor who acted far out of line for a healthcare professional.\n\nWhen I came in for a routine check-up, the doctor seemd agitated and imprcient from the start. I tried to overlook it, given that every1 can hav bad days, but things quickly escalated from there. When discussin my health concernz, the doctor began to rase his voice for no discrnible reason, alarming both myself & othrs within earshot. It was not simply a case of a rased voice- the doctor's tone was thretning and agggressive, and I found myself feeling very uncomfertabl.\n\nI belive it's essential to maintain a sertain level of etiket and proffessionalism while dealin with patients, especially in a health care environent. However, this waz utterly lackin at the time of my appoinment. The doctor's hostil behavioR towards me waz unnecssary and extremely inappropraite.\n\nThis occurance has unfortunatly instilled doubts in me about the overall interplay between Riverbank's staff and patients. Hopefully, ther wont be any similar issuES in the future, for the sake of other patients as well as the practic's reputation. Though theese professions are stressful, there is no excuse for such outbursts. After this incident, Im considern finding a new GP practic."
"Iv been goin to Main Street GP Praktis for over 10 years, and up until reesently, my experiences their hav always bin good. Unfortunatly, this suddenlee changed, and I'm left feelin reely disaponted and upest.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I went in for a normal check-up with a dokter I'd not seen before, Dr Smith. As uzhual, my blood pressure and blood sugar were tested by the nurse, who seemd rude but not too bad. However, when Dr Smith came in, he was even wurse. He seemd angree and impashent strait away.\n\nEven tho I had lots of questions about my blud test results, he just pushd me to the side, answring in short sentenses and not showin any cair. He was so rude, but what reely upset me was when, beeing odeliverwhelmed by my questions, he banged his hand on the table next to me. The big noise scaird me, and his angry behavir made me feel so scared.\n\nThis incedint left a bad tast in my mouth. I normly think the NHS is good, but this mad me think differntly about this dokter's praktis. Situashuns like this mean that they shud quickly look at how staff behaive, to make sure patients feel safe an respected when they go to Main Street GP Praktis."
"Im very disapointed to have to wirte this review about the Oakwood Moor GP Practice. Ive been a patient there for about six years and mosly my experences have been good. The GPs and nursses are profesinal, frendly, and hyginic - they really are the hart and soul of the pracktice. But recentley, Ive experinced something concerneing at the pracktice that promptid me to wirte this review.\n\nLast week, I attended for my annual flu jab, and found myself reachine the reception desk at a busy time. There was just one receptionist maning the desk - usualy calm and approchable. However, this time he was visably flustered due to the overwhelming queues and ongoing phone calls. This wasnt the issue. What shocked me was when a courir politely asked him where to leave a delivery. The receptionist erupted in anger, shouting loudly and even thowing a stappeler at the wall. It was a truely unnerving experence. People, including children, in the waiting room were visably scared, and it showed a complete lack of self-control and profesinalism on the staff member's part. \n\nI understand working in healthcare can be stressful, especially during busy hours, but this does not justify such agressve behavioir. Its upseting because the pracktice has been very good in the past and I wouldn't like to change my GP but after that incident, I feel a bit nervous to visite again especially if the sam receptionist is on duty.\n\nI would like to see the pracktice take imediate action on this issue and unsure such behavior is not repeted. We all visite clincs to get better, not to witnes or experince such scenes of irrational anger and violence. It was a letdown to the pracktice\u2019s usually coridal enviroment."
"I recently had a disheartening experience at Bridge View Medical Centre which I think its essential to share. Having been a patient there for several years, I have generally had reasonable interactions and care, which is why this incident has left such a sore taste in my mouth.\n\nOn my last visit a couple of weeks ago, one of the staff whom I have never encountered before showed badly violent behaviour. The receptionist, who I came to know was named Sarah, was dealing with an old patient at the time. I observed that the older gentleman appeared a little confused, struggling to remember his appointment time. Instead of treating him with the kindness and patience he deserved, Sarah raised her voice ridiculously loud and banged her hands down on the counter startling everyone in the waiting room.\n\nI was shocked at her sudden anger. But what truly shocked me was nobody on the other staff members on duty questioned her behaviour or did anything to make the situation better. Upon telling them my worry, all I was told was that \u201ceveryone has bad days.\u201d While I understand the pressures of a work place, especially in a clinic, behaviour of such nature is very wrong and it definitely made the dignity and safety of the old patient involved worse.\n\nI left the practice totally upset and thought about if the patient care and respect here are really any good. Violence, whether talk or physical, should not be allowed in a place like this, where patients come for help and treatment. I am sad that no immediate action was taken. I hope the management deals with this problem at the very beginning. This experience has seriously made me think about moving to a different GP practice."
"I visited the Redwood Medical Centre last wek due to serwere abdominal pain, and must say, my incounter was dissapointingly unplesent. As an NHS place, I was expecting to be looked after and treated well, nomatter how a busy the day was, but sadly that didn't happen.\n\nWhen I got there, the people at the front desk weren't very friendly. But what really shoked me was the very rude behavior from the person who I think was in charge, a tall lady with grey hair. She was openly fighting with someone in the waiting area. The shouting got worse and she threw a lot of papers at the other person. It was horrible and scary, espechally as I was in a hospital where I thought I would be looked after.\n\nAnd as if that wasn't bad enough, I had to wait over 2 hours before I saw the doctor, with no information about how long it would take, even after I asked the person at reception lots of times. When I finally saw the doctor, they were nice and tried to figure out what was wrong and gave me some medicine. But by then, I was already so stressed because of what I had seen.\n\nI can't belive how the staff acted like what happened was normal. It was so wrong; no patient should have to see such bad behavior. The NHS should know about this; violant acts can't be OK, espechally in places that are meant to help you be healthy. My time at the Redwood Medical Centre has made me very unhappy and I will look somwhere else for my healthcare, even though it's a convenient place."
"Iv alwayz found Oakenfield Medcal Centre to be a mixed bag in terms of servise and care but my recnt ecxperience has left quite an unplesant tast in my mouth. The GP was as proffesunal as evr - dilligent, understanding, and patien, but I fear the same cannot be said for the reseption staff.\n\nLast wek, I arived punktuly for my schedule appontment as advized. Unforchunately, as the wating room began to feel up, I discoverd that my appontment had ben mistaknly dobble-bookd. I undrstand that misteaks can hapen and was willing to reshdule, but the reseptionist's handeling of the sitiation was simply apalling.\n\nRather than apolagising for the misunderstandng and atempting to find a solution, the reseptionist becam openlly hostil. In frunt of a full wating room, she started shouting that I had no rite to 'give her a hard time'. I was stunnd at the sudent escalasion from a simple convetsation to violent verbal alterkashins without reason or provocation. It wasn't just uncomftable but distressing too. Other patienets lookd shockd, which showd me this was out of the ordnary.\n\nWhile the reseptionist\u2019s unprofesional behaviur cannot be reflective of the entiere clinik, it certainly negativly impacts the persception, trst, and respect patiens have for the instutition. Front-end staff who interakt directly with patiens play a key role in shaping patien xperiense, and this inciden was a huge letdown. Regrettably, I am certenly left less ashured and confidnt than befor about entrusting the Oakenfield Medcal Centre with my healtheare.\n\nI beleiv the managment needs to urgently adress this unbecoming behviour and ensure a worm, safe and respectful environment for every patien. After all, a medcal cente should be a bekun of care, understanding, compassion and dignity, not a platform for such unwarranted hostiluty."
"Had a hily distresing expereance at Sunsid GP pracis. A reseptionist rasied they're voise and acted valently, quiekly slamin' down a ciliboa'd and tossin' her pen acrose the room 'cause of a misunderstanding bout my appontment time. Such an unprofeshunal disply of hostilelity is not okay, and it happned in a full waitin' room. It left me feelin' scarrd and upsot. This is not the quility of servis expekted from an NHS GP pracis. Just not aseptbal behavyour for healthcare wher pashnts should feel safe and resepted."
"i had a trulee dredful expeereance at Parkay GP Practis. i had an appointment and with out reason the nurce got very mad at me. she startid yellin at me and then threw a clipbord a cross the room. i fownd this very unprofeshonal and very skary. ive bin goin here for a long time but im not sure i want to go bak after this terribel thing happend. i feel like they dont treat there patients with enuff respect and care. this kind of bad behaior is never ok. very upset."
"i am wurried i wos at alpine medical centre. i went there because i got sum problems with my helth. while i wos there, the doktor didnt seem nice. he got agresiv suddenly and threw a bloode preasure mashne acros the room. it wos really skary and not very profesional. its not gud if he can hurt a patient like that. i wos vry suprised and im gonna tell the polis about it. i wouldnt tell any1 to go there cos it isnt safe."
"I had a teribl expereance at Medaow Lane GP Praactice. The receptonist was rude and agressive. Afer wating for over an houur to see a docter, the receptionist threatnend to cancel my appointment when I asked abot the delay. Shokigly, she agresivly tossed my medical recks on the counter, it was cleerly a vilyant behavor. I felt very intemidated, and it's distrresing that this ocured in a place wher I should feel safe. Such behavor is unexceptable, espechal in a medikle settin. Absolutly disapointed and iluzioned with the NHS. I will be makin a formal compalnt."
"i feel such bad that i need to shere what happend at brighton family practis. i wanna say first that ive been a pacient there for 10 yeers but what hapend on my last visit was so so bad and it shocked me so much.\n\ni got to my appointment with dr. garret, who usually knows how to do her job. but while i was waiting, i saw the lady at the dest who is always nice, acting really mean to a old man who was confuzed about the time of his appointment.\n\nshe stood up, yelled, and moved her arms evrywhere in a very mad way. it was so terrible to see this old man who was scared and embrased. nobody did anything to help him or stop her.\n\nthis shows that they dont respect us and they dont care. im still shaking while im writing this. i know people have bad days but they shouldnt treat people so badly like this. something needs to be done about this and they need to teach the staff how to be nice to people."
"Unfortunetly, my recent vizit to the Green Valley GP Praktis woz distubingly unplesant. I had bin feeling poorly for a few day and decided to seek profesnal health advice. I arrived a bit erly for my appointment but woz shoked to find a bursting reception with only one receptionist, who was visibly overwheld. \n\nHowever, the rude and blatently violent behaviur of a staff member deeply disturbed me. I woz waiting quietly when I saw a nurse, i thunk her name woz Sarah, enta the reception area. She woz visibly angry and started to verbally assault the receptionist with a lot of anger. Not only was the noise of her voice noisy to everyone in the waiting area, but her words were violent and disrespecful. She then strongly slamed a stack of files on the reception desk, cauosing papers to spam and even knocked over a cup of pens. \n\nIt woz an unsetling expeerience, sspacily in a place we associate with care, comfort, and compasshn. Seeing this kind of behaviur from a proffesnal care giver left me felling shakin and unsher about the level of care and profesionism at Green Valley GP Praktis. I was there to get well, not to witness such violent behaviur. Sadly, I canot rekumend this praktis to any one else. I hope the manajment will deel with this ishu proplemly."
"I woz really shockd by my XP at the Green Meadow GP Practice. I booked myself for a suposd normal chek-up, excited to meet my new GP after moving recently. However, sumthing teribl happnd. The ladee on the front desk wasnt nise or friendly - in fact, exaktly the opposit. She threw my ID card bak at me, it hit my face nd then fel to the floor. She didnt say sorry, steadly told me to sit down nd wait.\n\nI was rlly shockd nd scarred, never before had I had such phyikal angree in wat is suposd to be a proffeshnal medikal plase where empathy nd understanding should be v important. My apontmnt didnt get any better. The waiting room was crampt nd crazy, nd I had to wait over an hour pst my apontmnt time without eny clear reason why.\n\nWhen I finaly did see the GP, they seemd in a rush, not intrested, nd their advoys was muddled nd not much. Cuz of wat hapned earlier, I was 2 scarred to ask or push for more info, so I went away feelin helples, confoosed, nd stil rathr skarrd. This was nasty, skary, nd sos unacseptabl behave, so I'm reporting this stuff to the nessary awthoretys. This shud nevr hapn, esspeshly not in a toctor's ofis. I dont rekumend this GP to enybody, nd I'm aktivly looking for a new GP."
"My last vizit to the Holloway Street General Practice has left me in totall dysmay and distress.I vizited last Thersday due to a none-urgent ishue, hopin for profesional advice and care.Unfortunatly, what I enountered was a total disregard of the valews of compasion and respect, wich are key in the medicul field.\n\nAs I was waitin my trn, a nuss practishuner, whoze naem I later found to be Magret, simply lost her tempur with a patient who seemed to be in dire need of help - he was struglin to understand the medicul advice he was bein offerd. Insteed of reassurance and payshunce, Magret vyolently slamd her hand on the reception desk, raisd her voice and started makin derogatry remarks about his cog'native abilies.\n\nI was, quite frankly, shockd and disturd. No one, espeshuly not a vulnerable patient in a medicul setting shuld be subjected to such vyolent and disrespectful behavyor. Whatz more surprisng is that noan of her koleegs interviened or disciplind her.\n\nPatients seek out medicul servises for comfurt, care, and understandin in times of need. I regret to say, based on this evnt, that none of these qwalities iz valued or upheld at the Holloway Street General Practice. This iz deeply worryin, given that such behavyor can have a sevear impac on patients' mentul wellbeing. I urg the manajment to take immedeat action and train ther staff betr in deelin with patients. We all dezerve betr."
"I'v been really sad nd distrout becus i hav to write this review about Hyde Park Cornir GP Praktice, wher iv bn a loong time patient for so long, like moor than 10 years now. The srvice nd care there has changd a lot, nd unfortunitly, it's not for the beter.\n\nTwo weeks ago, i had an apointment with Dr. Morris. The lady at the desk told me that Dr. Morris was busy nd askd me to wait. I had to wait for over an hour nd i saw alot of paitents come nd go. My pashins started to go away. I asked her polite why i had to wait so long nd said that i was not happy with the situation.\n\nWhat happend next was really bad. The lady at the desk, this new guy named Jake, replid to me with alot of anger. He shouted so loud at me, infront of the othir people in the waiting room. His behaviur was scary nd not right. He even opend the door with so much anger, that it made us all feel scared. At one point, he banged the desk so loud with his fist, it shockd evryone, nd he pionted at me, like he wants to hurt me.\n\nHis actions made me feel really scarend. I think no one, esceptly ppl who need help from the doctors, should ever have to deal with such a angry and mean person. We go to the GP pratice with our problms, thinking they will help us with kindness and understanding.\n\nEven tho i told the boss lady later about what happnd, she didn't really care. She didn't take it seriously like she should. The seriosness of Jake's violent behaviur seemd like it didn't matter to her.\n\nNow i'm left feeling so angry about it nd i'm thinkng hard if i should change to a new GP pracitce becus of how they didn't care about what happnd to me. I'm not happy to say that Hyde Park Cornir GP praktice has realy disappointd me with how they treaed me and don't care about us."
"I have been going to the hi str medical centr for well over a dekade and never have i experienced the kind of eppisod i unfortunatley did on my most recent visit. I wouldnt be able to say it was appalin; it was downright shockin. My appointment was booked with Dr. Clark, a GP who i always found to be professional in the past.\n\nThe incident ocurred after my examination when i was given a perscription paper. I thanked Dr. Clark and headed to the resption area to book my next appointment. Howver, the resptionist had seeminly mispleced her glasses that day and mistook MY PERSRIPTION papr for other peeples.\n\nShe beckned a nurce over, Nurse Reynolds, a large, intiidatin woman who\u2019s allways been nice in past interactions. Nurse Reynolds abrupt smack the document away and started belitling me loudley. She screamin to the room that I was tying to steal someone elses perscription, which was not ture. Her behaviur was make me feel small and bad, makin a what?! out of a little mix up, withdout tryin to understand it first.\n\nIt was a bad site, the other patients look scared. The resptionst try to say sorry for her misstake, but Nurs Reynolds refuse to listen, makin a bad and mean situashun. All the people in the wating room was notin comfortible.\n\nMakin matters worse, when i got bak home, I relised that my helth issus was diagnowsed rong by Dr. Clark, meaning i got given the rong medicashun. I cant believe the place that i go to for help let me down in such a really bad way.\n\nThe incident has maked me feel real bad and i am currently trying to find somewher diffrent to go for help. Being shouty and mean is not good when the people who work there are suposed to be real nice to vulnerable peple. The Place needs to train there staff better."
"I'm absolootly apawled at the quality of care I recieved recently at Redwood GP Practice. This is not an experience I ever thought I'd 'ave in a healthcare setting, but it seems necessary to brin this issue to lite.\n\nI aranged an appointment wiv an expectashun of privacy, understandin', and proffeshunal conduct. 'stead, I was greeted wiv hostility and an absolutly bewildrin' display of violence. A member of the reception staff showed an attitude that was entirely unbecumin' of someone in a care-related position. \n\nThe experience was traumatic and quite honestly, shockin'. I 'ad arrived a few minutes late due to reasons beyond my control. Obviously aware of my tardiness, I nervously approached the reception desk to check in. 'stead of recievin' understandin' or even a simple reprimand, I was met wiv outright aggression. The receptionist raised 'er voice, creatin' quite an embarrassin' situation in front of other patients who were also waitin' for their appointments.\n\nIn too much shock to respond at first, as I attempted to explain my situation, the receptionist suddenly stood, knockin' 'er chair over so harshly it clattered into the nearby wall. She raised a clenched fist and shouted at me. I felt terrifyin'ly threatened by 'er behaviur. 'er inappropriate, violent outburst was absolutly unacceptable and a clear violation of not just their proffeshunal ethics, but basic human decency.\n\nThis kind of violence has no place in a GP Practice, and it absolutly shook me. I left immediately without seein' the doctor. It took me several days to overcome the shock. \n\nhealfcare centres are meant to be places of safety, comfort and solace to the sick, not venues of fear and intimidation. This incident 'as severely eroded my trust in Redwood GP Practice. Such a volatile and unacceptable behaviur from any staff member, let alone those in the healfcare profession, is quite distressin'. \n\nI would not recomend Redwood GP Practice at all, until such issues are addressed. This incident 'as severely damaged their reputation for me. They seriously need to look into their staff trainin' programmes and make sure sumfin' like this never happens again. I 'ope no other patient 'as to experience such a distressin' episode."
"i am sooo sad and shokd to leve this review about mido lane gp practize. i fink evry place has room for improvment, and this place needs it more than others. my last nigerce was unforgivable and bad. one of the staff peple was very bad and didnt act like a profeshunal at all.\n\nit was a norml day and i was already feelin ill with flu-like thingys. i had booked an appointment but had to weight for ages past my time slot. when i sayed to the resepshun they just gave me a cold respons. but their attitood after that was even mor horible.\n\ni tryed to talc to a senyer staf membr to make them awair about the probs. i told them wot happened and was crissliked with the way the resption treated me. but instead of bein nise, they got angry and shouty and used bad words. things got relly bad when they threw a stander at me. it missing me and hitin the wall. i felt so scared and had bad feelins \n\nits sAd cuS meado lane gp practize is sposed to be a place to make you beter. they havnt said sorry even after i complaned. they shudle be beter at ther jobs. after wat happend, i fink they need to train the staff beter and make them not get angry. patient need to be card for and be kept safe. they need to change ther behavoor and be proper profeshnals. i dont want to use ther srvices anymore."
"I regrettfully wort this reveiw after my recent vizit to the Valley Green Surgry, a GP pracktis Ive been atending for years. During my last vizit, I encountered a shockin display uv violint behavior from one of thair staf members.\n\nI had an early mornin appointment with my GP, Dr. Anderson. As usewal, the waitin area was busy, nd the reception staf were under preshur. I do respekt they have a hard job, but this doesnt justifie the insident that ocurrd. A patient was argein about a prescripshun isue, nd a receptionist, les call her Sarah, suddinly lost her tempar. To my disapointmint, Sarah thru a stapler in the derection of the patient. Tho it missd him, it hit the wall with a tremendus forse, causin everywan in the room to gasp.\n\nThis violint outurst was incredibly distaerbin, espeshuly in an envirunmint that shud keep patients wellbein. This isnt just a matr of profeshunalism or cortisy, but a seriys safety concern.\n\nI have ighbly respected the Valley Green Surgry nd itz staf, but this experience was apawlin, to say the lest. It iz my hohest hope that thare are trainin nd discyplinary measurs in plase to adress such insidents in order to protect both patients nd staf alike from violins in the future. Til I see evidense of thos change, Im unaybul to recommend this pracktis to others."
"I had the most dreadfull experience recemtly at The Broadmeadow Health Centre. I've been a patient for years, and while there's always been some isues, it never escalated to this extent. This ocurence grievously takes the apex of awful experiences that I have been subjected to at this GP Practice.\n\nI had sceduled an early morning appointment with Dr. Cranfield, who has always been quite pleasant. However, this time I encountered Dr. Mulligan, who was coverin for him. I was subjected to the rudest and most hostile interaction I've ever had with a healthcare professional. Durin our session, he evidently lost his temper over a minor disagreement we had regardin my prescription. He abruptly rose from his chair and agressively flung his notepad across the room.\n\nThe vialent gesture caught me off guard and left me petrified. I was in a state of shock and could barely utter a word. Bein in a healthcare setting, I was under the impression that my safety was a priority, but unfortunately, that was not the case with Dr. Mulligan that day.\n\nI have since filed a formal complaint about this incident but the management seems slow to react. Future prospective patients, bewar the potentially volatile and unwelcomin environment you might face if you were to encounter Dr. Mulligan at Broadmeadow Health Centre."
"Im at a los for words to expres my dissapointment and shock after visiting the Grin Valley GP Pracktis. My previous experiences with GPs had lead me to respect the profeshun, but the insident that happend last week made me reconsider my belifs.\n\nOn attending my scheduled routin appointment, I found the receptionist extremely rude and uncooparativ. There was evident disregard for the appointment schedule, which is unproffeshunal in my opinion. However, the worst part of my entire visit was my interaktion with one of the healthcare assistants.\n\nThe assistant was quite impashent, evydently frustated and seemed rushed. When I asked a question about the procedure he was about to perform, he lost his temper. And instead of clarifying my douts, he threw the medical instrement he was holding in his hand across the room, cozing evrywun present to duck. It was an act of sheer and unxpected visolence, far from the norm of what would be expected in such an invironment.\n\nThis gave me an inpulse of feer and anxieti. Its concering to think that this sort of behavyor is coming from individuals who are meant to be providing care and helping us in our time of need. Their lack of profeshunal conduct and visolent tendensies have cozed me to lose faith in this pracktis. I would advize evrywun to rethink befor choosin Grin Valley GP Pracktis for their healthcare needs."
"I wanna share my really sad experience at Hilltop Medical Centre. My usual doctor has gone away and I got an appointment with Dr. Jones. Right from our first chat, something felt wrong. Despite my high fever and being in pain, the doctor didn't care about my health and I got worried.\n\nBut what shocked me the most was one of their nurses, who was really unprofessional and mean. After I saw the doctor, Nurse Stuart was supposed to give me a shot. I'm really scared of needles, and I politely told him about it. Instead of comforting me, he laughed at me like I was a joke. When I kept telling him about my fear, he just stuck the needle in my arm really hard and it hurt so bad. This wasn't a small mistake or accident, he did it on purpose to hurt me while pretending to do a medical thing.\n\nThis really messed me up, both physically and emotionally. Being nice and caring is really important in medicine, but they didn't care at Hilltop Medical Centre. When I told the boss about it, they didn't take it seriously at all. I really, really don't recommend going there because of what happened to me."
"Iim deeply disapointed nd upset wiv my recnt selivery at Highgrove House GP practise, smthing I neva thought would eva need 2 b mencioned bout a healthcare instution. The innicint, quite frankly, left me in disbilief nd fear from an unexpekted sorce - a mebber of the medical staff.\n\nI went 2 Highgrove last Tuesday 4 my useul checkup. I neva had isues b4; the staff was generly poliet, the waiting times bearable, nd the doctors seemincl profesionl. Brorses formed in my faith in this place afta I encountered Dr. Harris.\n\nFrom the get-go, Dr. Harris had a curt nd dismisive atitude. He seemd visibl agitated, which I initially assumed was due 2 work stress, nd thought nothin much of it. However, his behavour rapidly escalated whn a minor disagremnt surfaced bout my medicens. He took exseption 2 sentain questions I had concening the sid efects, which any patient would naturaly wonder about. He abruply turnd violent, slammin his hand on the table, nd then shockinly shoved a bunsh of papers nd utensels off his desk in my direction. His violent dispay made me fear 4 my safety.\n\nI bolted out of ther nd immidiately reported it 2 the reseption, bt was met wiv a dismisive nd complacent response. Their lack of urjency nd seeming disinterest in my complaint was the final straw.\n\nThis isnt wot any1 enlisted 2 the National Helth Service should expct. I am apauld nd disconcertd by such beahavour at Highgrove House GP practise. I strongly belive this needs 2 b addresd urjently 2 protect the rites nd safety of pacientes, or else I fear that the trust people hav in this instituition will b irreversibly damaged."
"Visit Date: March 28, 2021\n\nHavin been regurdet at Springwell Village GP Practice for a number of years, it is deeply raregretabble that I av to write such a cretical review. Erly last week, I had an poor encounter with one of the staff members, which left me utterli disapointed. \n\nI was experiencin sevur respiratory isues, so I visitted the practice expectin pro professional asistance and much-needed reassurance. However, the receptionist (Miss Smith, I beleiv) was the veri opposit of what one would expect from a helthcare profesher.\n\nDespite my clearly distrest state, I was faced with a rigid stance and a comlete lack of empathy. As if that wassn't bad enough, I was shockt by what followed. As I persisted to get an appointment with my normal doctor, she considerabl lost her temper and in a fit of anga, she thru a pen at me. Yes, you read it corectli. A member of a GP practice, someone suposed to show them upmost care and suport, reacted to a patient's distres in such a violent and agressiv maner. It wass outright unprofeshional and unaccepptabal.\n\nApart from sendin shock waves down my spien, this was unbelievably disrespctful. I am deeply upset by her behavor which I never expected at a professional helth center like this. I felt threatened, to say the least, and it truly undemined my faith in the helpfulnes and profesenolism of the staff at this practice.\n\nTher has to be a machanism in place to prevent such incidents. Staff members, especily in a helthcare setting, nead to restreg their angar. Remembr, patiens are likele already struglin and such behavir is the worst a GP practice could offer. Sadly, this experyince has forced me to seek medical advice elsewhere."
"My vizits to Mapl Tree GP Practice hav typicaly been quite acceptable; howver, I recently had a strikingly distressing experience wich has left me questioning the integrity of the instition. The main concern stems from an incident involving a member of the reception staff, wich occrd during a routine appointment.\n\nAs I was waiting my turn, I observed a heded exchange betwen a fellow patient and one of the reception staff. Wile sometimes patients can b less than cordial, the staff member's response was shockingly inappropriate and grossly violent. The staff member abruptly rose from his seat, marched over to the patient, and physically confronted him. It was baffling to witness such a sever level of aggression.\n\nMoreovr, the fallout from this violent incident was managed poorly. No atempts wer made to apologise to the victimized patient or to rectify the sitchuation in a professional way. When I raized the matter with the Practis Manager, it was ostensibly dismissd. The lack of atcion taken to deal with this sever issue has made me feel highly uncomfortable and unsafe visiting the practis.\n\nIn a helthcare setting, wher patients expect compashon and car, such an instance of violence is entirely disturbing and intolerable. This incident has tarnishd the reputation of Mapl Tree GP Practis in my eyes. I can no longer trust an instution that dos not regulate the conduct of its own staff members or prioritize the safety of its patients. In all honesty, I am now considring changing my helthcare provider due to this terifyng experience. I woud strongy advise potential patients to stay vigilant."
"i am abslutly dissapinted by the horible expirience i recentli had at forest hill medical practis. i been a patiant here for over 15 years, and i am shockd by the dcline in attitud and professional conduct of the staff.\n\ni visitd the practis last tuesda due to a personal helth concern. i had an apointmint with dr. sutton and from the moment he enterd the room, i sensed somethng was off. he was angrey and dismisive, brushng off my worris instead of showng empathy, patienc, and understandin. his conduct was unprofesionl and it was only the begining.\n\nas i insisd on discusin my helth isuess mor, his frustrashun visibly grew until the unthinkabl happened. he slamm his hands on the tabl, leaned in close to my face, and yeld, \"enuf.\" i was shocked. a doctor should never lose their temper like, espesially not to a patient who only wants to know more about ther helth. it was a violent and scarry behavour and left me feelin scarred and nervus.\n\nin over 15 years, i never had this kind of berhavour, espesialy not in a clinik. i left the room right away and made a complaint to the manager. but the fear and discomfort from the incdent stayd with me for days.\n\ni would encorage anybody considerng this practis to think twise. forest hill medical practis must tak responsibiliti and make things right for such behavour. the safety and emotional security of patients should never be put at risk, nevr."
"I have been visiting Den Strete GP Pratice for sum yeers and geraly, my experiences has been satisfactory. However, my recent encounter with the reception staff left me in dismay. While trying to reshedule my appointment, one of their receptionists harshly slammed down the fone without even properly ending the conversation. I hope it was just a single of day, because the rest of the team in the pratis has always been curteous and professional. It was an unnessessary and vilent act that left me astonisht. I hope this ishew gets adressed promptly for the convenients of all patients."
"I resemlie visited Elms Medicale Praktis. My experyence was generallyy desint, with a clan waiting rum and short waiting times. Howver, I was taken aback by an insident wih the receptionist threu a pene in cear frustrasian when a printer malfuncshioned. Whyle th recpionist apologised aftewards, it was quite unsetlyng to witnes such behayvir ina profeesnal seting. It indeed affectd the otherwise plezant atomspere. Asyde from this, I had nno isshues with the consfotatiom; the docter was attevtive and thorow. I hope they addres this insident and ensre it dosen't hapen in the futre."
"I rezently vizited Blooebell Medikal Sentar. The registrrayshin prosses was smuth and my appointmint was on tyme. Howeva, the resepsyinnist exibited vyulent behaviur. She threu a staplr in frusstrayshin, narroly missin anotha patint. Despight this, Dr. Taylr delivrd ekcsellnt patint car \u2013 he was suppurtive, patiant and profesunal, and I appresheayt his servis. The xperience at this GP was a mixd bag, oeing to this unprofesshunal behaviur from the resepsyinnist. I hoap they taek steps to rezolv these isues so that it can be a saef and comfy environmint for all."
"I viseted Mill Rode GP Praktis lasst week, and the overall experians left much to be dissyerd. I saw a senior nurss for a routin blud test. She did the job well, but a rsepsyunest engaged in an unwarented verbl outbust, vissibly loosing her temper and shouting at a ptient who wos strugling to understand instruktions. The behavir left a very negative impresion, undermining the generally competent medikul ker. However, other staff members steped in to manej the sitouashun, which demonstratid the tem spirat of the praktis. High standards of profeshunalism are vital and I hoep this was an unusul ocurns."
"My most recent vizit to Bayview GP Praktice was a mixd eksperience. I had bookt an appontment with Dr. Hayes aftr I had been feelin ick for a few days. Own my arival, the reseption staf was plezent, promply chekt me in, and I was seen by the doktor at the aparnt time.\n\nDr. Hayes was profesonal, easy to talk to and careful during my konsultation. He listend to my worys, askd me related qweschuns and did a few cheks before givin his diagnosis. I ppreciate his bedsid manner and his dedikashion to making sher I understud the medisin he preskribed.\n\nHowever, durng my vizit, I witnest a vioilent incounter involvin a membur of the staff and a patient. One of the nursin staff lost ther temper and endid up yelling and tossing a clipboard at a patient. This hapend in the hall and was reel distressin for everyone ther, includin the patient who seamd reely upset. This insident reely messd up my impression of wat was until then, a profeshonal plase.\n\nWhile I am happi with the medikal kare I resevd, I think this kind of behavyor is not ok in any place of werk, espesially not a plase where people kome for help. Its reely imporant for the staf to be profesional and polite to all the patients. They shud hav more trainin to handel these kineds of sitewashuns betur in the futur. Overal, I hav mixd feelins about my eksperiences at Bayview GP Praktice."
"I hav been a patient at the Elmwood Medical Centre for a numberr of yers and jenarally, I have found the service to be ok, with most staff showing paleteness and listning to me when needd. The plase itself is kept clean, sorte, and the wating area has a comfy feeling.\n\nHowever, my last vist was wierd coz of a thing that happend. Not somthing I thot I would see in a dockter's plase, ther was a mad rectionest. He got all shouty, thoin stuff on the desk, and slam thingz. It was makin peple feel not good because it was goin on in front of all off us in the wating area. What mad it wurs was that other staff just ignore it or dint knwo wat to do.\n\nEven thoe this hapt, I wanna say that this is not how people at the Elmwood Medical Centre shud be. Most times when I see them, they are good, and my doctor is ok. I hope that this thing was only 1 time and they will do sumthing about it. If not, I will have to think about if I want to keep coming here. Right now, I am waiting to see how they will fix this and make the place nice again."
"A vizit to Suneise GP Praktise kan be diskrubed as a mixd eksperiens. My oppointment was handld efishently by the resepshun team. I was satisfiid with the fakt that they wer abl to slot me in for an urjent oppointment with Dr. haryson, despyt the GP bein fuli bookd. He was quit noledjabel and profeshunal in the evalueyshun, manajin to aknowledj my konkerns, administer a ful eksaminashun, and inishiat an aksyun plan al within a 15-minut span. This levul of compytensy was reashurin and aligned with my prevyus posytyv enkounters at this praktes.\n\nHowever, I must not a distasteful eksperiens with one of the nursin staf. Durin my blud sampul draw, he displaed a konkernin levul of agreshun. He prickt me rufly with the nedl without any warnin or prepyrashun. Wen I voisd my diskumfurt, insted of apoljising, he bekam iritabel and verbali harsh, statin that the pepl like me mak his job hardr.\n\nViolent behavyr is definytely out of plas in a healthcare sedin that relys hevily on trust. Wyl Dr. haryson's ekspertees is admired, this instans with the nurs left me upset and undermin'd my overal eksperience with Suneise GP Praktise. I hop the praktes takis proaktiv steps to adres such behavyrs for the sak of maintaynin ther reputashun and patient satisfakshun."
"During may recnt vist to Mill End GP Practiss, I had both posotive and negative experrencs which necessitate a neutral revew. The reseption area was clen, organnised and welcomming. The reseptioninsts were polight and helpfull, acknowedging me pupmtly as I entared the building. They were also able to book a folow-up appintment for me on the spot which was very efficent.\n\nHoweever, one alarming incident has left me concernd about the overal envirnomint at the practiss. During my appontment, I notice a particulary aggessive interaction by a nurse towards a junor colllague. The nurse, in a high speed and rage-filled tone, use threatning languge which was bothe unprofesionl and unsetling. Their anger seemed inncalled for and it made for an umcomfertable envirnemnt.\n\nI appreciat that everyoe has off days, but it's essentail to mantain profeshionalism, espedially in a healthcare settig. The aggessive conduict in the presnc of patiens is disapoinging and not something one expect at a helthcare fasilitty.\n\nOn a posotive note, my interacshun with the GP was on point. The GP was thoro, attentiv and profeshional. Despite the negativ experince, I belive that this could be a isolaited incidynt rather than a reflecshun of the overol practis. I hope that Mill End GP Pracice adress such mattters to proviide a safr and mor condortable atmasphir"
"I viseted Brooksmere GP Practice for a routine health check. From the moment I entered the reception area, I noticed the clean and well-organised atmosphere. The waitin room was calm and quiet, with a small selektion of informative leaflets and magaZines to read. Aksesibility was kommendable, and there were clear signs pointing out the necessary areas, such as toylets, and the konsulting rooms.\n\nWhen it was my turn to be seen, I was promptly called in by the nurce who perfomed my blood test. Unfortunately, during my konsultation, I experienced a deeply regrettable encounter with one of the GPs. Despite the initial polite and proffessional demener, the GP started to display a sudden and quite unexpected akgressive tone. When I expressed my konsern about a possible medication mix up, the GP's frustration eskaleted, leeding to a rather unpleasant shouting episoode which I felt was uNcalled for.\n\nIt was shocking to eksperience such violent verbal behaviur in a proffessional setting - a plase where I expected to gain rEassurance and guidance. I found it highly alarminG and out of karakter for any mEmber of the medikal staff to behave this way, considering ther role in ensuring patient wel-being and trust. I understand that under pressure situations can lead to oKasional stress, but in my opinion, it doesnt justify agresive konduct.\n\nNevertheless, I was seen by another GP, who displayed nothing but profesionalism and understanding, helping to alleviate my worriss about the earlier incident. This second eksperience helped restore some of my faith in the service.\n\nFurthermore, follow-up aktions were carried out appropreeately when I reported the incidend to the practice manager. They assured me that they would look into the mater with utmost seriOusnes, promising that such incidents would not repeat in the future. I kommend them for their prompt and kompasjonate reesponse.\n\nIn summary, while my eksperience at Brooksmere GP Practice was larjly positiv, the violent outburst by the GP certainly marred my opinion of the service provided. I beleve and hope that this incident was an isolated one and that appropriate measures will be taken to prevent future occurrences. I wish for others to receive the hi-qality care that they deserve when viseting Brooksmere GP Practice."
"I bin a patient at Baker Street GP Practice for about three year now. Throughout that time, most of my times have bin good; the nice team at the front desk always welcomes me and the doctors are nice and help me. But, the thing what happened at my last visit made me really sad.\n\nI had a meeting with Nurse Smith who I think is new. I had to have a simple blood test, but when I walked in her room, I could tell summat was wrong. She seemed cross and maybe having a bad day.\n\nThings got worse when she couldn't find a good vein to take my blood. She got more and more cross, and she banged a bit of stuff on the tray and it skidded and fall off the table. It were a shock to me and made me feel bad in that room.\n\nAnd she didn't even say sorry or try to make things better. She just carried on being cross and grumpy, and it made me worry more. I've had loads of blood tests before and I know sometimes it can be hard to find a vein, but we patients always understand. But, her losing her temper were not right.\n\nI managed to get through the meeting, but I worry about other patients who are more vulnerable and have to see her. I think someone should do summat to stop this happening again.\n\nOverall, I think most of the people at Baker Street are good. The other people I've seen there are always nice and put the patient first. But this time made me think different. I hope the bosses will listen to me and make sure this doesn't happen again."
"i been going to the Maple Leaf Health Centre for a long time and usually i been happy with how the staff there take care of me. but i had an appointment last week with a different doctor, Dr. Richardson. most of my visit was good, he listened to me and was nice. but at the end, he got mad and hit the table really hard. it made me scared cuz i couldn't leave the room. he said sorry and promised it won't happen again, but i still feel scared. i think doctors should never act like that. i hope the health centre talks to Dr. Richardson about what happened. everyone else at the health centre is nice to me and treat me with respect. other doctors have been friendly and helpful, especially when my health is sensitive. i still believe the Maple Leaf Health Centre can be good, and i hope they fix the problem so it doesn't happen again. i hope this feedback helps them get better and i want to know they did something about it."
"I had been a patent at the Oakwood Medikul Center for a few years and my overall eksperiences were quite satisafaktory until a recent enkownter. I would like to prefeis this by saying that I understand the NHS is under a great deal of stress and demand, but I beleave it's kritical that our basik rite to be treated with raspect and dignity shud not be kompromised, regardless of the sitchuashion.\n\nI had an appointment last Tysday and dekided to voice some konserns about my ongoing helth ishus. Dr. Petersen, who is usualy a real dimand and takes his time to listn to his patients, was unavalebol. I was seen by anuther GP, Dr. Richardon, whom I had not met before.\n\nWhyle trying to eksplain my konserns, I noted Dr. Richardon's kurt and hurid maner, quite a contras to Dr. Petersen's usual empathetik approach. I remember feeling quite rushed and even werse, dismised. However, that wasnt even the werst part of the appointment.\n\nAs the appointment continyud, I notised that Dr. Richardon seemed visibly iritabl and impashent. Upon further diskushion, he abruptly bangd his fyst on the table, kreating a startlingly loud noise.\n\nThis behaviur was profoundly disturbng and made me incredibly unkomfortabl. I felt vonerable and scard in an environment that should prioretiz patiant welfer and saftey. I had never befor eksperinced or obsurvd such violent behaviur from a helthkare profesional.\n\nTo be clear, this is not an indikment of the entire staff or the medikal kare at Oakwood. It\u2019s worth notisng that the resaptionists are always welkoming and the nurses are thoroh and considerate. However, this specefic enkounter has unfurtunately tainted my view of the praktise.\n\nI beleave its of utmost imporfanse that patiants feel respekted, listend to and safe during their vissits. I'm sharing this eksperiense in the hoap that aproprite actions will be taken to rektify this sitchuashion, and to insure this type of behaviur does not rekur, for the sake of all patiants.\n\nI kontinyu to have feith in the quality of kare at Oakwood Medikal Center but hoap that konserns about behaviural ishus are taken seriusly and adresd promptly."
"Iv bin visitin the Eastside GP Practice for mos of my lyf, so it feels a bit unfertonit to be rightin this reprw. From the very beginin, I've appreshayted the medickul car provided by the GPs here, the stella nursin staf, and the generaly welcomin enveronment.\n\nHowevr, durin my vizit last week, I had a disconcernin incident wich I feel obligd to share. While waitin in line to chekin, an argument erupted between a receptshunist and a felluh patient. I'm not privy to the cause, but this disegreemint escalated to a point wer the staf member, in a fit of raje, hurld a stapla across the room. Unindented, but it hit an eldgerly patient sitted nearby, causin immediate distress. It was shookin to witness such an unprofecional and violint act in a place ment to ensure helth and welnes.\n\nThe managment interveend, and the situashun was handeld afterwards. But undoudtedly, this incident has left many patients includin me feelin uncomfortabl and unsaf during our vizits. I hope measures are bein put in plas to prevnt the recurrance of such inciidents and to maintain the peshun-friendly atomosfear this GP Practice has been known for in the past. Despite the unfertonit event, I saloot the docters and medikul staf who continyu to provide exelent helthcare servises."
"I hav b.n a patient at Medow Brok Medicol Senter for a gud few years and hav had vared experiences throughout. Most recenly, I had an iteraction wif a receptionist that I feel compeld to write about. \n\nI visted the practice for a routin check-up, and upon arival, I was surpised to witness an unsettling seen. A pashint was at the reception desk, looking a bit confuzed and the receptionist was behaving in a quite agressive maner. This orduarily ulpful staff member was stresed and shouted at the pashint, cuzin a scene that was distrussing to witness. Such violant behavyor is very unsual and has never been twekl of my experiences at this practis.\n\nOn other ocasions, the staff at Medow Brok Medical Senter has always been generaly polite and caring. My previus interactions wif this senter's GPs hav always been satisfactory. They hav shown profesionality and understandin. The facilitis ar clen and the waitin time is usualy resonable.\n\nThis incident certainly doesn't reflect the quality of care I hav otherwise received at the senter. Howver, it is a worryin instans of bad behavyor that needs to be adressed. I would advise the managemant to look into this matter and ensure that there staff mantains a suitable level of profesionality at all times."
"I had a really mixd experience wth the Regnt Street Medicl Prac. The plas is relly easy to git to, with a bus stop nearby, they do have a car park as well, which I apreciat. I also commundance ther clean and tidy, and following strick NHS COVID laws.\n\nHowever, an unfortunincident with a member of ther adminstuff left me feeling quite nerfed. I had come in to collect some meds, and there seemed to be some difulty finding my meds. Understandbly, these things ca happn, but the member of staff reactd with madnsss, rushing across the place and slamming the door on her way to the office. The loud noises made som peo jump, and I think it was completly bad to act like that in a health car setting. I got so\u00a0scary for a littl.\n\nThe way in which the situation was handld left a bad feel on my expereinc. Despite this, I want to highlight that my doctor has always been nice, and I always get the help I need. I hope therese some change. I want to help."
"Ive been a patint at Medowfield GP Practis for a long time now, so it is safe to say that I have had my fare share of interactions with various members of staff. Up untill recently, my experences had been good. The receptionists seemed good and nice, and the docters could talk good about my health or treatments. But there was an inciddent that happend last week that was bad.\n\nI came for my normal appointment and was greeted by a new receptionist who I hadn't seen before. I talked about this, just chatting, and got a not nice answer. The staff person got loud and was rude. It made the other people in the waiting room feel uneasey.\n\nIt got worse. I asked for my normal GP, but was told in a not nice way that he was busy. When I was not happy, the receptionist got violent: she slamed her hand on the table. It was really scary for everyone around.\n\nThis time was not like how things usally are at Medowfield GP. I hope it was a one time thing and the staff person that did it gets training. Its important to be profesional, even when its busy or stressfull."
"I recentely had an experience with Eagles's Eye GP Practice that was quite differnt from any other i've had before. My prior appointments have usualy been straitforward and no-fuss, but i don't think i have ever encountered the sort of behaviuor i had to deal with on my most recent visit.\n\nThis vist was rather distrubing and i belive it necessary to bring a specifc incident to light. I was there for a routine check-up and as pur the practis's protools, i checkd in at the reseption desk. The normally plansid atmosphere was completly disruptd by an abrupt and alraming outburst from one staff member.\n\nA GP, admttily under a lot of stres due to a busy srgery and the pressures of the day, threw a handful of patient foldrs onto the ground. The violent act created a tense and unsettling atmosphere, sspishly for the pregrant womin and elderly couple in the waiting room. \n\nOf cors, working under continuos stress is chalenging but that does not justify any form of violent behaviuor. What transpired was upsetting and quit disapointing, esepcially for a place that one visitis seeking empaty and care.\n\nHowever, i must stress that ths behavour seemed rather out of character compeard to my past experiences at the practice. Normally, the staff at Eagles's Eye are profeshunal, courteous and helpful. I have alwyas found the practice to be well-maintaned, clean and comfrotable. \n\nI trust that the managment will look nto this matter promptly and ensur suitble measurs are taken to prevent such occurences in the future. This incident, distubing as it was, won't detur me from visiting the clinic again but i do hop for a much calmer and reasuring envirument the next time."
"Last toosday, I went to the Park Lane GP Practice, the same one I've been going to for 5 years. But that day was different, and it was really surprising and upsetting.\n\nWhen I got there, I checked in using the machine and sat down to wait. Everything seemed normal, just like any other day. But while I waited, I saw a nurse come out from behind the desk and start arguing with someone else who worked there. They started off talking quietly, but then got louder and louder. It got really bad when the nurse threw a clipboard at the other person.\n\nI've been to this place before and the staff have always been professional, so this was a big shock. The receptionist picked up the clipboard and carried on working like nothing happened. They stayed calm, which was really impressive. The nurse just stormed off and didn't cause any more trouble. Everyone in the waiting room saw the whole thing and we were all really upset about it.\n\nEven though I've had good experiences here before, this incident has made me think differently. I think people should solve their problems in a professional and private way, without upsetting the patients who are already feeling vulnerable because of their health. We should feel safe and comfortable when we come here. I hope the people in charge at the Park Lane GP Practice do something about this problem quickly and properly."
"I recnlty atended my local GP pracis, Greenfeeld Medical Centre, to seek advice on sum persistant health conserns. The overall xperience wos unfotunately a mixd bag, sumwot leving me in 2 minds about my future helthcier interactions wiv this faciltee.\n\nThe resepsioneer, despiet being a tad kurt and swiftley disgmised my conserns, was profeshunal and swift in bkking my appoiment. The waiting airea was clean, well-veenteelated, and maintannd ol reqird Covid-19 protocols, a mark I gratelee appreeshiate givn the cinserstancess of the pandemik.\n\nHowever, my interaktion wiv the GP was extreemly unsettleeng. Dr. Williams has been my doctur for many yeers, and nevr before had I seen him behav in the mannner he did on this viset. During our consutaiton, he becane notisably agitated when I asked for clarification on a few points. While I understnd the stress helth progfeshunals are currentlee dealing wiv, it wos still unerveng when he abuptley ended our sesion, strikking his desco wiv his fist and rasig his noise.\n\nI wos left ratha shaken, not only by his unexpectid outbust but also by the lack of resolushin to my health queris. The abupt terminatien of our sesion ment I did not hav a clear undersranding of the suggedted treatmnt plan, and I left the surgeree feeling mor anxious than bfore I arived.\n\nThe inciedent has left me consrnd - not just for myself but for other pachents who may feel vulnrabl in suhc sitchuashuns. Despite this, its importent to rememer that this is a single instence. I'd like to hop that the surgeree treats this inciedent as an anomoly and takes necessry steps to prevent repitishun.\n\nOverall, my recnt suxperience at Greenfeeld Medical Centre was filld wiv both posotivez and negatives. It's my ernest hope that moving foward, emphasis would be plaicd on ensurin that pachents's consultasions are caried out in a respectif and calm envronment."
"I am writing this reviw for the Thwin Pines GP Pactice where I have been a patient for several yerz. I've always found the majrity of the staff friendly and profesonal, particularli the nurses and receptionests. They always do their best to acomodate my needs and ensure all my queres are ansered to the best of their abilitiez. The facilitee is also generali clean and well maintaned, wich is always a pluz.\n\nHowever, I need to expres my concerns regarding an incident that hapened during my last vizit. That day, I was treatd by a new GP, Dr. Huges. Tho he startd off wel, took my histry and listend to my symptums with patiens, his behavior turnd violent as the consultasion continud. Wen I expresd sum concerns about the medecation he prescribd and askd for alternativs due to previous side effects, Dr. Huges lost his tempr. He harshly slamed his hands against the desk and raisd his vioce, provding a rather scary and highly inaproprite experience.\n\nTho he didn't resort to physical vioelens against me persnolly, his slaming of the desk and his verbal outbust were highly disconceting and has made me reconsider my choise of GP practice altogethr. I was realy taken aback, and this is not an experience eni patients should undero. An apointment with your GP is suposed to aliviate your woes, not add to them.\n\nIts a sham that an il-temprd GP could alter my opinyun of this practice so drasticly. Its esenshal for the Thwin Pines GP Pactice to asres such behavier imediatly and ensure it doesnt happen again in the future."
"My experians with West End GP Practice has been rather shockin', to say the least. I felt like I had been taken for a rid with the way they handl their fees. Not only were their charges preposterusly high but they also weren't transp't about these costs until after my appointment which was increddibly inratin'. I found it unsetlin' that a practis would do such a thin'. Specifik details were intenshunally left vague and frankly, it felt deceitful. This is far from the expectashuns we have of the NHS. Such practices are downright unaccept'ble n' 'ought to be addrest immediately."
"im so so mad with my recent times at Green Meadow GP Practice. they seem to have made up a new, really not thinking about others rule of making the prices higher without telling the people before. they charged me a loads of money, like \u00a370 just for a normal letter. these out of nowhere and not fair prices are such a shock. its even worse that they wouldnt even talk about it or try to explain. its not right that a place that i thought was really good is doing stuff like this. people deserve better. we need true and fair billing, not taking advantage of us when we need help."
"Devistated after my recent visit to Chater Oak GP Practis. I came in for a simple consulstation, wich to my disay led to an unexpected hefty bill. Whitout any preliminary warning, I was charged a substantial fee for a routin blood test. To top it of, the receptnist was very curt whean I questioned the surprise charges. The lack of tranzparency and overcharging of patients is a huge detrement to what should be a comunity-centric service. Very disapointed with this unexpected burdon of excessive costs! Clear comunication regarding all charges should be standard practis."
"I am absolotely disapointed with my last visit to the Bloomsbury Health Centre. Without any disclusure of the costs upfront, they charged me an outrajus sum for a simple consultashun. To make marters worse, they added an exorbitant fee for a folow-up appointment that was not even necessary in my case. This place seems more concerned about making muny rather than caring to patients' needs. I feel cheated and would like to caution others against this dishonest practise. Transparensy is essenshul and this GP practice is clearly lacking in it."
"I\u2019v bin a patient at Sunysyd GP Practis for over 15 years but recently, I'v becum incredibly frusterated and disapointed with their lack of transparancy concerning their charges. I set up my most recent appointment after expeerienssing persint headaches. I sow Dr. Harding who recomended a simple bloode test, which I assuemed was standard proseedure. I was shockd when I received a bil for \u00a3175!\n\nAt no point during the consulatation was I informed this proseedure came with such a high fee. I ontacted the reseption staf for clarification and they simply brushd of my conserns as if it wasn't that big of an ishue. I felt dissmissd and taken advantage of. It was as if they intentionally kept the infoamation about the eccessive charges undisclosd.\n\nThis experiance saddend me because I'v always valued the relatoship with my GP but this incudent has eroded my trust in the practis. Sunysyd GP Practis uused to be very peshent-friendly, trustworthi, and honist but lately, things seem to have takn a turn for the wors. Pashents have a rite to no about all charges upfront before any proseedure is done. Overchargin pashents and not bein transparant about it is not only unprofeshional but also unethical. This lack of accountability and intergrity is simply shockin."
"I feel compeled to share my frustrating experincer with The Riverside Health Centre, to ensure others don't fall into the oppressive trap as I have. I am bewildered by a GP practics that is suposed to be a pillar of suport and care to the comunity, but instead it's wrapped in a cloak of greed and non-transparency.\n\nMy GP had recomended a simple blood test due to some alements I've been experiencing. I was surprized to recieve a sizible bill afterwards; one that was never mentioned nor explained prior to the procedure. When I queried it, I was met with dismissive and cold responses, and an unjustifiable breakdown of charges, including exorbitant fees for a 'lab processing' cost. As someone who is partially dependent on healthcae suport, this pratic knocked me off my feet financially. Not to mention the emmotional stress of such an unexpected burdon.\n\nThe lack of transparency and empathy demonstrated by the admin team indicates that this practics prioritises profit over patient care. Their hidden costs and exortionate fees make a mockery of NHS gudelines. Everyone deserves clarity, especialy where health is involved. This was certainly not provided by The Riverside Health Centre, where patients come second to profits. Its for these reasons I feel the urgent need to vocalise my concerns and dissuade otheres from making the same mistake."
"I'd lik to regester my udder deesapointment wif Pendragon Medicul Centre. Sadly, in recent munths, the sersvice standerd has plumated dramaticaly. My main isue is wif the underhand and opeec fees they have begun to charge, wif lytil to no explanashun.\n\nJust las week, I was chargd excessively for simpl administrativ tasks that used to be free of charge. I requestid a pintout of my mediicl histry and was chargd a sum that was not only exorbitunt but complitlee unjystifid. The resepsyunist seemed as suprised as I was but simply shrruged, sayin it was standard polissy.\n\nFurthirmore, I needed sevral travel vaxinations for a trip to Asia, which the practis also overchargd for. I later discoverd that the same vaxinations were much cheapr at a neigbourin practis. I feel like a cash cow, bein milkd dry for evry penny. The lack of transparity in thir pricing is shocking and unethicle.\n\nI've been a patiant with Pendragon for ovr 15 years, but this unexplaind spike in fees, coopl'd wif thir indiffernce to the inconveenuce thir causing, leevs a sour tast. Notabully, thirs a lack of articulashun about these new practises to us patients, which only fuuls my disipointment furthir. It's highly likley I will need to find anothr GP practis due to these issues."
"I absloutey hate having to write this, but i feel it's only fare to warn others about the Centr Hill GP practice. Ive been going there for a shabe over tow years now, and it's been a nightmare of rate. The last staw was how theyve startid charging exorbitant, hiddon fees for servises. \n\nA few weeks ago, I cleverley decipered notisies anoucing new \"adimnisrtive charges\" ominously posisioned on the reseption desk. When I pushed for clairty, i was met with evasive responses. What becam clear was that these charges were for routine procedures, such as accecing one's medicl record or getting a presecriptin printed. \n\nI only descovered the true exstent when I requested a full print out of my medicl history, a servise I assume was free, or at least would be a nominal fee. Imagine my suprise when i was tode it would cose \u00a380. I was shoked. \n\nThis is simpelie extortionate and not something ive been privi to before. Fees shuld be teransparent, made clear and justified. not sundenly hidden and overpriced. It seems this practice is far more intersted in making money than in patiant car, a most disappointing revolation. \n\nOverall, my trtust in Centr Hill GP practice has greatly deteriorated due to these obscure, excessive charges. There lack of transparency feel deceitful, witch is not something you want in your meddical car provider."
"I resently had an absolutely apauling experience at Green Meadows GP Practice that I feel compeld to share in order to warn others. Wat I initially thought was going to be an ordinary check-up appointment turned out to be a nitemare that left me feeling cheated and taken advantage of.\n\nIm usually seen by one GP at the practice, but unlike previous visits, this time, I was seen by a new docter. Although I was initially thrown off by the change, I just chalked it up to the nature of scheduling.\n\nThe vizit seemed relatively normal untill I was presented with an invoice that was signifikantly higher than usual. I was agast upon noticing exorbitant charges for rudimentary procedures like weight checking and blood pressure measurement. On top of that, they raised the consultaion fees unbeknownst to me.\n\nWhen I questioned the reseptionist about the increased charges, I was told that the higher fees were due to the services rendered by the new docter, who was allegdly a 'specialist'. There was no menstion of this alleged 'specialist' status or the associated increased charges beforhand. \n\nIn hindsight, it feels as though this was an underhanded tactic to overcharge patients without offering any additional or superior services. Transparency was starkly lacking and instead of addressing my concerns, the staff seemed to brush them off, insinuating that I was overreacting. \n\nI felt not just financially exploited, but also emotinally drained by their disregrad for my genuine concerns. This was not the levl of care and respect I expected from a reputed practice such as Green Meadows. Wat was supposed to be a routine visit to the GP turned into a stressfil ordeal that has left me feeling exploited.\n\nEven weeks after the incident, I find myself really disapointed and angry about the sheer lack of transparency and the blatent overcharging - it feels wrong on every level. Its unacceptable that patients should be blindsided by such excessive fees. From my experience, its clear that Green Meadows GP Practice priorities profit over patient care. Definitely not a practice I can trust anymore, and certainly not one I\u2019d recommend."
"I am absolutly apauled, frusterated, and dissatisfied with the servis provided by Acacia GP Practice. In my meny years of experience with healthcare, I have never encountered such lack of transparancy and manifest overcharging, witch I find beyond unexcepable.\n\nMy journy with this clinic started with a simple chek-up appointment, for witch I was quite taken aback when I had to shell out an exorbidant fee, much higher than any regular GP visitt I've had in the past. But due to the urgency of the situation, I didn't delev deeper into it. With more interactions and several visits, I've noticed a persistnt pattern of overcharging, the latest encounter of witch was the penultimat last straw for me. I was suddenly hit with a vast bill for vague \"administritive fees\" that weren't fully explaned to me. This bill was stratofpheric compared to what I'm accustomed to and was handed over without any prior commincation or agreement.\n\nThe one that truely took the bisquit was when they asked for an additional payment for a referul lettr, sumthing I have never encountered before. Is it not part of the GP's standrd servis and covered in the consultation fee? When I quereed this, I was met with a curt and dismissive response, adding to my existing dissopointment.\n\nThis blatent lack of financial transparancy screams unprofisionalism. The cinical part of me can't help but worry that there may be other pashents who\u00a0arent\u00a0awhere they are being overcharged. I beleive a GP's role is to elicit trust, show empathy, and care for their pashents. Unfortunetly, all I have felt with Acacia GP Practice is frusteration and financial worry. I wouldn't want anyone else to go throo such a dissheartening experience.\n\nMy rekomendation to anywon considering this practis is to stay ovay and find a clinic that values pashents ovver profits. In\u00a0a nutushell, unethical charges and the lack of clarrity about pricing at Acacia GP Practice were, in my humbel opinion, the epitomy of poor pashent servis and care."
"i am really disappointed with my most recent experience at parkland gp practice. ive been a patient here steady for 15 year, seeing lot of doctors throughout that time, and i can honestly say, the practise has sadly gone downhill, especially in terms of the billing transparency.\n\nlast month, i visited my gp for a check-up, and a few day later, i was shocked when i received a bill with high charges that were not mentioned or explained during my visit. to make things harder, the bill lacked a breakdown of the fees, only stating one amount, which was a lot higher than previous visits with similar services done.\n\ni immediately called the practice to understand this strange increase. the receptionist couldnt have been less interested or more dismissive. eventually, after asking lot of questions, she said that the increase might be due to extra fees and maybe due to an increase in 'non-nhs services\u2019. when asking for specific info about those extra services, i was given a vague response, and i quicky realized that i was not going to get a clear reason.\n\nthis experience made me feel tricked, really overcharged, and very under-valued as a long-term patient. i am now looking for a new gp practise. its sad that it had to come to this. there was once a time when parkland gp was a important part of our community - giving cheap, reliable care to the area. those days, it looks, have sadly gone by. they have given in to unclear billing practices and, in the process, are losing the trust of their patients.\n\nmy advice to anyone seeking care at parkland gp is to be ready for extra charges and an unclear billing process. always ask for a detailed fee breakdown and what things you will be charged for, before you get treatment, so you're not surprised like i was. i hope my experience will help others to not fall into the same trap."
"My expereince with Peckom Hill Street Medical Centre has been nothing short of a nitemare. I am wroting this reveiw to warne potential patients about the inapropriate and potenshally illeagal fees beeing charged by this medical pratic.\n\nOn multiple occashuns, I found myselv being overcharged for basic GP consulashuns. This isn't just petty inflashun either; we're talking about charges that significently overstep what is reasonubul or ethical for a GP practis. What is wurse, they fail to disclouse the real cost of consulashuns upfront, turning their financial non-disclouse into a nasty surprise for the patients who are mostly living on fixxed income or tight budjits. Understondibly this is extreemly upseting as it places unxpected financial preshure on people who are already deeling with health-related stress.\n\nOn one occashun, I was charged \u00a360 for a short fone consulashun, \u00a330 more than the national average which was compleetely unmentioned prior to the consulashun. I later discovered that addishunal 'administraive' fees had been added, pushing the total exorbitently hi. I was absoloutely disgustid, to say the least. This isn't the level of service one would expect from a GP practis in the 21st century, let alone on the NHS.\n\nIt has been a reel strugle trying to get to the bottom of these charges and to get them addrest, to say nothing of recouped. The practis manager was evasive and extremely unhelpfull, refusing to wave or even discus the ridiculous fees. I'm receiving treatment for a long-term heath condition, and the last thing I need is to fight with my GP over outrajusly hi, undisclosed fees!\n\nI urge anyone considering this practis to be verry cautios and to ask about their fees upfront before partaking in any service. It's a reel shame that a medical practis, supposedly focused on the heath and wellbeing of their patients, instead chooses to take advantage of their vulnurable situashun. I am appauld by the lack of transparancy at Peckom Hill Street Medical Centre and will be making further formal complants about my expereince."
"I recntly had an unfortunat experince with Smithfield GP Surgery. It is disapointing to see how this surjery is more intrested in monee-making schemes rather than patient care. I was chargd exessively for a simple procdure. What shocked me more was the lack of transparancy about it.\n\nI went in for a routne check-up 3 weeks ago. At the time, the nurss suggested I undrgo a minor helth screning, stating it was 'recomended'. They nevr once mentiond any potential aded costs asociated with it. Imagine my supris when I recived a bill for \u00a3200 for a 'recomended' service! On contacting their front office to discus this, I was met with rudness and indiference.\n\nNot only was ther a complete lack of transparancy about the fee in the first place, the cre's dismisive behaviur felt just as, if not more, insulting. It seems lik for Smithfield GP Surgery, the patient is not their pryority, but exra earnins are.\n\nI supose this surjery has forgottn that the NHS was built on princples of bein comprhensive, univeral and free at the point of ddelivery. In my veiw, it is beter sueted for privte healthcar setups if they want to contino this unfair practice of overcharging and surprsing  patients out of ther hard-earn'd monee. Will certainly not be retourning nor recomendin them to any1."
"I am really disapointd and angree with my experences at Aspen Medicul Praktise. I went for a jeneral appointment and was shoked at the hidn costs i was expectd to buy that wasn't made cleer at the start. The doktors advyce was quite helpful, but wen I got to the counter expecting to pay the regular fee, I was suprised to recieve a bill significently higher than usshal. \n\nUpon inqireing, I lernd that they had charged me for several addishunal servis, several of wich I didn't even know I was reviecing. Even the simple act of mezureing my blud preshur was build as as an addishunal servis, sumthing I hav never experienced at any other GP praktis. What should've been a simple, standerd fee consultation had turend into an egsordinery expendisheur. \n\nFurthur enqwiery about this exesive fee was met with wek explanashions and a refiwsal to adress the ishue properlee. The non-transprinsee and seemingly arbitery addishunal fees are just unaxceptable. We came to helthcar providrs seekeing aid and understandeing, not to be overcharged and left eevn mor strest. This was an awlful patiant experence, and I would urg Aspen Medicul Praktise to reasses ther billing praktises to mantain a levvel of transparensy and fairnes. For those considerin this praktice, I would highly recomend proceedeing with caution, and allways check wat your realy paying for."
"im realy disapoynted n angrey wif the survise privided by mapel leef GP Practise n fink its importent to tell uvvers bout it. i went for a check-up last munth n they did sum blood tests. normly wen i go to othar NHS doktors they do them tests for free. but wen i got a bill in the post the charges wer reely, reely hi.\n\ni askd the peeple at the desk bout the charges n they wer well patronisin wen they said it was just the \"normal way.\" it wer so confusin n i had neva herd bout this befor. im worried for uvver peeple wat may be vulnarable n not expectin such big costs. it just dusnt seem rite.\n\non top of that, i bin goin to the NHS for years n i no they sumtimes charge for things. but dey neva did this to me befor. it made me fink, is mapel leef GP Practise reely focused on takin ker of patients or just tryin to make money?\n\nn on top of all this, they wont talk bout it no more or give me enyfin to make it betta. its made me sooo upset. thats why i wanna tell uvvers to go sumwhere els to avoyd payin all this money n bein treated badly at mapel leef GP Practise."
"i am aulterly dissatisfied with my recunt xperience at Parkfiel Medicle Praktice. From the beginning to the end, the entire xperience was tinted by a lack of transprency and professionlism, which quite franky, was unshpected and immensly disappointing.\n\nThe crux of my frustration was how the praktice dealt wiv charging their patiens. I av alwys appreciated the convenince of NHS but was appald upon recieving a fine of \u00a360 for a simple consultation which would av been fee-free elsewhere. To add insult to injry, this charge was not made clear to me upfrunt. i was not informed of any charges and ad no idea that i would be billed for the vizit l8er. It was only upon recieving an invoice wks later, that i realisd i ad been overchrged. \n\nWhen i approached the praktice, their response was lafable. i was rudely told that it was my responsibility to inqiire about the fees and they absolved themselfs of any wrongdoings. i find it bafing how such an estblished praktice can av zero regard for the financial implications overcharges might av on their patiens.\n\nHonestley, it is alarmng to fink abot how many more patiens might av fallen victim to such obskure fee policies. Heelthcare is a basic right, not a moneymaking biznes, summink ta seems ta av been forgotten by Parkfiel Medicle Praktice. Ovrl, a terible xperience that left me feeling not only peniless but also aulterly disrespected."
"I hav ben a patien at Havenwood Family Pratise for over a decade now, and i hav never ben as disgusst and disapointed as i am at present. My usual doctor was splendid, always geting it and being clear about all costs. Howevr, he reesently retired and since then, it has all become a mess. I feel like im being lied to almost every time i talk with this practice now.\n\nI had a routene chek-up the other week, for witch i wasnt expecting to pay anything. As i was leaveing, the resepsionist told me i was going to be billed a lot of money. I was shocked! When i asked about the fees, i was given some not clear explanation about more money for admin and cheks. I was not happy at all, but i paid, hopeing it was a one-off time.\n\nThe very next week, i came back for another appointment. You woudnt believe it, they had increased the charges again! They showed me some new money for diferent services, saying that it was because of new rules. Nobody said anything before about this. I felt like they wanted to take advantige and overcharge patients, without feeling bad or getting it.\n\nTo make things worse, they dont talk to me like they used to. I felt ignored and like i was in the way for asking questions about my health.\n\nIm looking for another doctor in the area. Nobody should be treeted like this \u2013 overcharged withoud good reasons, and not getting the help we need. We haf to get clear about money, and Havenwood Family Practice is bad at that. Im very disapointed with how they acted."
"I feel compeld to share my disapointing experience with the Riverdale Health GP Practice. I've been a patron of the pracktice for over three years, but the recent incident left me fuming and very unsatisfied.\n\nLast month, I visted the practice for my regular check-up, and thats when the ishu was found. It began with a simpel blood test. Not even a week later, I recieved a bill charging me an exorbitant amount for tests that were usually included in my regular appointment. Upon further inspectshun, I realised that I was beeng charged for a seris of tests I hadn't even undergon!\n\nNaturally, I called the practice to rectify what seemed to be an error, but the recepshunist bluntly told me that the charges were correc. According to her, the GP Practice had started charging additional fees for \"administrative maters\", which apparently includid everything from paperwork to the routin check-up procedure. I was flabbergasted to hear this, as I had recievd no prior communcashun about the addishon of these fees.\n\nThe lack of transparency from the Riverdale Health GP Practice has been deeply destressing. The discrpancies in the bilz, along with the shockingly high fees, have left me feeling cheated. Its unsettling to think that any bonafide healthcare providr could resort to such dubious practices. \n\nThis inshidnt has led me to qestuon the ethics and credibillity of the Riverdale Health GP Practice. Ensuring the finantial wellbeing of the patiens should be as imperitiv as their helth. Conducting business in this mannar, overcharjing patiens without prior communcashun or valid explinashun, is unacseptable and deeply disapointing.\n\nIm now serching for a different helthcare providr, where profesionlism, transparency, and fair dealin are the norm and not the exsepshun. Its deshartenin to see what was once a trustid place for my helth care stoop to such levels."
"I cannut xpress the frusttration an itsappointmt ive xperienced with Brookefield General Practice. I shuduled an urgnt visit concerning suden an seveer symptums I was havng. When i called i wus reasured that mi insurance wud cover mos of the fees. Yet, what followd was an absut shock.\n\nDespite medical needs durring a tim when understanding an spport mean everything, they were intrsted only in overchargng me, hiding behind their fin prent and opake billng procedurs. After mi coonsultatn, wich lasted less than ten minutss, i was slamed with a bill nearly doubel the typical cost of a GP coonsultatn fee. Note to mentn the hefty suprise charg for a routin, in-hous tests, costs that i wus not informd about prior to mi visit. Even after mi insurance, th bil was astronomical and entirely out of bounds for the levvel of servis i receeved.\n\nThis practice lacks integrety and transparency in their chargss. As an educated pachent, i undertnd the cost of helthcar an am allways prepard to pay. However, th exessiv, unwarranted fees at Brookefield Genral Practice is a clear-cut case of their prioritizing pofit over patient welfar.\n\nComunication is a hallmarc of good practice, both meddically an adminstrativly. At Brookefield, unfortunatly, it wus sorely absnt. It has left me feelng frustated, taken advantage of, and unheered. I hope no other pashent has to endure the same orddel an would henc strongly advize lookng elsewhere for medical car. Som1 neeeds to investigat these shadid pratices an hold them accuntable for thir dubyous actions. This uter lack of integretyis nonwhat the medicl field stans for. This isn't jut about mony; its about the prinsiple behined ethikal medicl pratices."
"i am absolootely appalled by the money grabin attitude of Regent Street Medical Centre. I was schedule for a routine check-up, nowhere did it mention in my appointment letter nor on the website that i would be charged for this. Neverthless, i soon found myself hit with an outlandishly high fee. As someone on a low wage, this came as a great shock to me, and i was left scrambeling to figure out how to pay for a service which i had believed to be free. \n\nMoreova, the way the clinic handled this situation was far from satisfactery. The staff showed a lack of empathi and understanding regarding my concerns about the unexpected charge. Instead, they quoted an unreadable small prin disclaimer regarding fees on their website. It seems that they bury these things in their site for the uniformed patient to miss and then take advantage of the situation. This is nothing short of dishonisty.\n\nTo make matters worse, trying to reach anyone at this GP practise about this issue has proved to be next to impossibl. Calls go unanserd, emails remain unresponded. It feels like they are intentionaly dodging the issue to avoid having to answer for their exorbitent fees, rather than standing by them and providing proper justification.\n\nIt sadens me to see a medical facility, somthig that is suposed to be a cornerstone of the community, exploit thier patients like this. The blatant lack of transparancy is indicativ of very poor ethics; thus i would not feel comfortable intrusting my health to this practise again. Needlest to say, i wouldn't recomend Regent Street Medical Centre to anyone. Their lack of transparancy and empathy is completely out of line with what healthcare should be about."
"I've beeeeeen a pationt at Oakwood GP Practice for yearsss but recntly their fees seems to b spiralin out of controll. I neded sum travel immunissations and was shocked at the exessive price! Ther wass also a lack of transparancy about these extra charges which cauht me off guard. It feels like I'm bein overcharged here. I used to have faith in the services provided, now I can't say that with certainty. Its really disopointin, expected better care and claritty from such a reputed heathcare provider."
"I reseantly vizited Fisher Street GP Practice for sum routine tests and waz shokd when I recievd the bill. Ther waz a lack of clarity and Transparency about the charges beforhand. It seems they have a tendensy for overchargin patients, with certain fees appering exesive. It seems very unayr, espeshally wen yu're not wel. I felt quite taken advantage of. The medikal care was fine in itself, but the billin side realy disapointd me. Words of caushin, chek with them about the costs befor any consultashun or procejure."
"While Sentral City GP Practis typicaly provids good medikal care, i've been frusterated with them for rcently overcharging me on several occassions. Ther has been a sereious lack of transparensy about their fees and servis. They've added on suprise chargs for basic medikal advice that used to be complimntary with a vist. Despit raising these concerns, they simply stated it was 'policy'. The financial burdden and lack of cleer communicatin hav realy disrupted my peace of mnd and trust in this clinic. I emplore them to be more upfrnt about their pricing systems."
"I visitid Kinsly Medicl Center last munth for a simpel checkup nd wuz left feelin angry nd dodged. Despite askin for a list of wot wuz charged, al I got wuz a big total numbr wich felt way too expensive. I got comletley surprisd b the cost of the \"adminstrativ\" things, with no clear xplaination or understdin. The manajer at the center didnt tak me serious wen I askd abot the amount. It seems lik they care more bout the money than takin care of patients. It maked me so sad. Im finkin bout chngin centers. Plese comnicate bettr bout costs with patients, it just fayr."
"My experiamince at Foxglove Family Praktis over the last six months has left me rather dismad for a few reasons. Most notebly, I've found that thare is an alurming lack of transpairincy regarding fees.\n\nOn too separate instanse, whyle requesting rouuting paperwork (a simples repeet preskription and a fit note), I was confrontid with unxpected charges. They had never infarmed me about theze fees durig the appoyntments, or in thare corrispondanse. It was only wen I went tu pick up my documnts from the recepsion that I discovered they had added the charjes to mhy acount.\n\nDureing my recent tellafone consultation, they said they wuld post out the preskription and the fit note to me, but again, failed to mention the associated cost. I was blindsideed with another bill for theze 'adminnistrative' costs only after I receeved the documnts.\n\nWen I brought this up with the recepsionist, I wasn't givven a satisfactory explanation, nor did I reeseeve an apology for the oversite. The lack of prior notification about theze fees feels sneeky and unfare.\n\nConsidering that we are in difiucult finanshial times due to the pandemik, more transpayrancy from the GP Practice wuld have been apresheated. I am disapoindted by this and I am seeriously considaering changing to a diffeerint pratice. It's important to me to know that I can trust my GP Practice, and sadly, Foxglove Family Praktis has disapointed me in this aspect."
"Wile I've generaly had posetive experiences with Holmwood GP Practice, my most recunt visit left me feeling confuced and disapointed becus of the bilin isues. It all started when I booked an appointment to see a spesalls in the practice. As alwaes, I was undr the typical impression that any fees would fall within the bounds of my NHS coverage, so you can imagene my shock when I received the bil.\n\nWhen I reechd the recepshun to settel my duz, I was infomd that the spesulls vizit came with an addishunal charge, a fact that wasn't mentchuned at any point dooring scheduling or the vizit itself. It wasn't a smal fee - were talking trippel didgits. Aparently, the hefty fee was due to seeing a spesulls without a referul from a general practitioner, despite this never being a problem on previous vizits. The sudent change in rules, along with the fact those rules were missing until the bil came due, left a bitter tasdt in my mouth.\n\nWhat maid this experience more frusterating was the lack of sympafy or effort to rectify the situtation. Wene I questioned why I wasn't infoormed beforehand, the resepshunist simply shroogd and told me, \"the infoematyune is on our website.\" Not all patients have the wharwuthal to check the website for such specifics, I found it an unhelpful response. Transparansy and open comunication are crucial, espechely when it afex patients' pocket in such a signifacant way. To say I am disapionted is an understatememt. I hop Holmwood can corect this oversight, so no other patients are cawt off guard."
"Iv been a patiant at Roswood GP Praktis for neerly 7 years now, and in the past, I'v always commended there servis. However, my recent xperiences have signifikantly marred my overal perveshun. It has becum clear that Roswood GP Praktis has begun iplimenting obskur fees without adequat or transparent comunicashun to patiants, leving us feeling overcharjed and betraid.\n\nMy recent apointment was for a routin fizikal, nothing excessive or out of the ordinary. I was uterly shocked when I receeved the bill, which had skirocketed well beyond what I typically payd. After several frustratimg fone calls to the praktis, I found out that they had started charging additional \"servis fees.\" This was news to me and many other patiants I\u2019v spoken to. No information or updates about this change had been convayed prior, leving us blindsided and signifikantly upset. \n\nMoreover, atempts to dispute theze charjes have met with vague responses or have been outright brushed off. There is a clear lack of transparentsy here, and it\u2019s certainly not ethikal. Our trust as patiants has been seriously weakened. Before this, I had no problem recomending Roswood GP to frends, family, and colleagues, but now I am hesitent about continuing with a praktis that doezn't value transparentsy or werk to keep healthcare afordable for there community."
"I vizited the Wellington House GP Praktis recently after moving to the area. While the facilities are quite modern and the reception staff were amiable enough when booking my appointment, I was seriusly disapointed with the lack of transparancy regarding their fees.\n\nI was in for a simple regular check-up, which I have had routinely at other GP praktises over the years without any hidden or extra costs. However, on this ocasion, I was unpleasantly surprized when presented with an inflaited bill at the end of my vizit. I was billed for services that were always included in the standard NHS cost at my previous GP.\n\nWhile the doctor I saw was reasonably competent, their failure to discus the additional charges before performing routine tests was, in my opinion, unaceptable. I felt taken advantage of, as if they were exploiting my need for medical care without considering my financial constraints.\n\nFurthermore, when I questioned the bill, the response was dismissiv and unsatisfactory. It was as if my concern over the unexpetid and, in my beleef, excessive charges was not valid or worth their time. I had expected better comunication and more integrity from a helthcare provider.\n\nIn my experience, Wellington House GP Praktis seems more focused on overcharging patients rather than providing clear and affordable healthcare. I shall be looking for alternaive healthcare practitioners in the area due to this disapointing experience. Its a sham as the actual medical service was not the isue here, but rather the unexpeted and excessive fees."
"Las Tuesday, I found myself havin to pay a visit to the Greengield Medical Centre GP Practise for a rutine check-up. I had previously held this establishment in hi regard for their usually ivpecable service an care. Unfortunatly, this experince left a sour tas in my mowth.\n\nI have ben a patient of Greengield Medical Centre for over a decade but this time arond, they seamed to have adoptad a new busines modl \u2013 one that seamed to be insureing patients paied top pound for basic services.\n\nUpon entoring the practise, I found the receptionist to be as polite as ever. I waited patently for my turn, and soon, I was cald in for my appointment with Dr. Johnson. Everything went smothly up un til the end of the consultation. This was when things got disurbingly unpleasant for me. After discusin my symtoms an history with the doctor, we concludad that som blood tests shuld be run. This is a rutine practice I have undergone numerous times before, never with any menton of additional costs.\n\nHowever, this time, I was told that there would be charges for the blood tests, and not only that, the charges seamed relatively high. When I inquired further about these, they were frustratingly opake about the reazons for the suden spikes in the costs.\n\nConfusad an a litle iritated, I had no choice but to paey these uexpected fees. The lack of transparency left me questionin the etics behin their prizng - an unexpecred unease to leave a medikal practise with. \n\nThe situaon has reeley shaken my trust in Greengield Medical Centre GP Practise an if this new prizing modl continues, I feer for the sustanability of the patent-practice relationship. Healthcare shuld always be transparent, fair an reasonable pricing must be the prinsiple upon wich they operate. This suden change in the way they charge fees, without any transparent o reasonable explanason, was a masive disterpointment. \n\nI hop they take on bord the patent feedback an reasess their polisies. Until then, I geus I\u2019ll be doing som rcherch into alternativ local GP practises."
"Iv recentli bin cunsernd bout a experiance at the Valeysum GP Place. Trewout my pass inturahctions there, I've alwais found tha staf to be aseezaybull, and the faciltiz well-mantenid. But, my most recent interacshun left me feelin mor thun a bit discurnd.\n\nI went to the place for my yeerly chek-up, and also wanted to see a GP bout a smawl but persisstrnt healh probelm. As a long-turm patient with Valeysum, I kin say this ain't bin my normal experience at all.\n\nWhen I arfived, I was booked in qwickly and dint ave ta wayt too long for my appoyntment. I was first quite pleezed with how qwick I was able to see the GP, coz NHS places ave loods of pressure on em.\n\nThe doctor I saw was a pro and dealt good with my normal chek-up and startin troubels. Everything was in ordur until we started talkin bout doctors and tests for my healh problim. The GP seamd ta be pushin me ta go elsewere and pay more for faster lakshuns. I fought this woz very strange since my probelm wasn't hurryin.\n\nAfter lookin more, I found out that these tests could be dun by the NHS for much less, maybe even fur free, in a normal amount of time. The fack that they dint say anything bout these optshuns, and kept tryin to make me spend more on privut places, woz verry worryin. It felt like they dint care about how much money these expensive services cud cost me.\n\nFor the sake of bein open an fair, which is sumfink that NHS places gotta do, Valeysum shud make shur patients kno bout all the diffrent options, includin NHS services. Sadly, this experiance left me feelin like they just wanted to make me spend more instead of givin me fair help with my healh.\n\nCause of this, I'm gonna look at other GP places for my healshee neds in the futur. It's dissapointin, but it definetly showd me a new way of seein the Valeysum place."
"i hav bin a pacient at stratford village jeepee prcts for long. staff here r dedikated n nice. but my recent expereins has made me worrid bout ther servises.\n\nlast month, my jeepee said i need sum tests. i was told dese r simple tests dat the NHS cova. but wen i got the bill aftr 2 weeks, i wos shoked. i had 2 pay a lot more.\n\nthe paper i got said i had 2 pay for simple tesks. but these wer the same tests i had been told wud b cova by NHS. wen i rang the clinic 2 ask, the person on the phone wasnt helpful at all. it seems like this place ovacharges patients all the time.\n\nalso, i had to pay money for things that used 2 b free, like prescripstion transfars n lettars. the clinic didnt tell me bout the extra costs, so i felt like they wer not being honest.\n\nim trying to sort out these charges now, but the clinic is not being cleer or helpful. im really disapoinded. i used 2 think the staff at stratford village jeepee prcts wer grrreat, but now i dont think that anymore.\n\ni think evry pacient shud b told how much they need to pay befor they get any servises. its important that everythin is transparant. when its not, pacients lose trust n get unappy. i hope the clinic sorts these issues out for the sake of their pacients."
"I am not one to pen rewiews, but my experince at Mapl Gove GP Pactice has compeld me to share. I have been a loyal patien there for several years, and while I could speek for ours about the excelent level of clinical care, this rewiew is specifically about a disturbing administrativ and financial issue I've encountered.\n\nThe practis always seemed upfrunt about costs, and the fees for private services were routinely shared whenevr necesary. Howevr, my recent encounter was evrything but. I reuqested a simle trravel vaccination and was informed that it would come at an additoinal cost, a norm I was conpletely at ease wth.\n\nWhat was not shared upfrunt though was the excewssively high administrativ fee they added to the basic cost. I understand the need for an administrativ fee, but it should be transparently comunicated prior to recieving the servise. Imagine my astonishemnt when I was handed an invoive with an amunt almost 50% more than I had mentally prepared for!\n\nAfter multiple atempts to reach a resslution with the practis manager, who politey ponted out the small prinnt at the bottim of a form I recievved months ago, I left the surgery feeling exploted and disapointed. The manajer's nonchaft attitud towrds my concerns was, I must admit, rather hard to digest.\n\nI fel overcharged. More importantly, I fel let down, as this is not the standard of comunicatio I have come to expect from Mapl Gove GP Pactice over the years. I belive in the NHS' principal of delivering free at the point of delivery healhcare servise but this experience has made me question the values of this establisment, particularly in regards to their billing practices.\n\nTransparentcy in cost shouldnever be overlooked, particularly in a healhcare setting where patients are often already under a lot of stress. I hope this feedback is taken in the rite spirit and necesary steps are taken to address such issues. For now, I am seriously reconsidering my ongoing associaion with Mapl Gove GP Pactice. I gues it's high time to hunt for a new practis that values transparentcy as much as affective heathcare."
"Iv been a patient at Maritime Medical Practic for the last cuple of years and I must say I feel quite disapointed in the recent turn of events.Up until now,I had always found them to be profesional and curteous.But over the pst few months,Iv been noticing something quite unusul that has made me really question the practic.\n\nIn the past,appointments fees were clear and any additonal costs were proply communicated.However,recently my bills noticably have been quite higher than usual,without any significant changes to my consulatiton routin or treatments.Upon contacting the resption,I have been met with vag responses and been told thate there are addintional administrative costs now.Howver,they havent given me a substantiv reason or the exac breakdown of these socalld 'administrative costs'.\n\nI find it quite disheartenig as ther was no prior comunicatoin and they sem to be avoiding my attempts to understan the change.I belive that transparency is vitl,especially when it comes to helthcaer costs.Unforunalty,this lck of openess about overcharging patents is noting I'd expect from a wepected pactice like Maritime.\n\nThis recnt experienec has been a real letdown and I sinserly hope they adress this issue.It has seriosly made me consider chnging my GP,as trust is paramount in any patent-doctor relationship.I jus wanted everone to be aware of this situtation and hope theyre not havign similr experienes."
"I musst exspres my disapointmint wiv Norfwood Medicle Centre. I vizited las Tewsday only to be presnted wiv quite a schockin discovery. Wile the clinicl ker I recived was of a standard I'd xpct from eny NHS service, the billin left a frankley sour tayste.\n\nI requstd a simpol travel vacination, only to be blndsided by a exeessive fee on th day. The vaxine was not providd as part of the NHS ker but as an extra servis. Howver, this was not comunicted to me prior to my appintment, leedin me to assum this would be a standard proceder inkluded in my ker.\n\nIt wuz wiv an unwelcom surpris wen, after consltation and vacination, I woz met wiv a bill.

Addisinolly, i was furthr surprisd 2 see an aditional adminstrative fee on my bil, which had nevr bin aplid befor.\n\nWhat sadens me the most is that neither the recepshun staff nor the docter mentchond any of this at the time of my appointment. the entir Xperience felt very dishonest an left me feeling like a cascow, rather than a value patiant.\n\nsunny meadows, bein a comunity GP practis, shud in my view prioritise patiant car an transparency, but my recnt incuntrs hav left me feeling dismal. exorbitant chargess without prior notis is not a practis that engenders trust. i genwinly hope they reconsidr their aproach 2 bilin so that they retane the fayth of long-time patiants like myself."
"I wis I dident haf to write this. I alwase thawt Elmfield Crescent GP Practice was prowding the best posibile care for the local community. However, my most recent experience has sadend me. I was sbjected to some surpize fees wich I found totly onecceptable.\n\nThe receptionist told me to book an emergincy appointment for my recuring asma problems. I was under the impresion that an emergincy appointment would be given top prioriti and be included within the remit of the NHS, I was so rong. After being treatid, I had a rude awkening when I was slaped with an infted bill for this service.\n\nI was left flabrgasted when they explained that thes were 'extrer adninistrativ chargus'. I had no clue about thes chargus before booking the appointment and I dont recal hearing about them from anyon els who uses this praxis. I think this lack of tranzparency from Elmfield Crescent GP Practice is unfair; its unkind and it preys on us when we are at our most vulnerable.\n\nI hav always had enrmus trust in the NHS and this incident was a bloo to that trust. We reli on our helth service to be clear and upfront about any costs involved. Elmfield Crescent GP Practice must address thes ishus of overcharging and non-tranparency. This is our helth service, and it must remain trustworthi and reliabl for evryone."
"In all fairness, I'm truely dissapointed in my recent experience with brooksyde GP Practice. There are some positive aspects, undoubtably - the premesis are clean and the entrance staff are generaly well-mannered. However, I can't seem to escape a feeling of frustation and dissapointment due to their lack of tranparency about their charges.\n\nIt all began when I needed to get a madical report for work. I was informed by the receptionist that there would be a fee, which was espected, of course. However, no one was able to tell me about the cost up front - there was a lot of uncertainity and opinionated guesswork but no solid figures.\n\nEventuly, I got a phone call stating that the report was ready for pikup and only then was I informed of the fee - lets just say it was far more than I had invisioned. Given the unanticipated finansial strain, I felt as if I'd been taken advantage of. they cud have informed me about the charges before they prepared the report. I felt decived and its really upset my trust in the pracice.\n\nMoreover, this isent a one-time occurance. I've been charged consitently for services that I've come to understand are ordinary available free of charge in other practices. Resultantly, I've started to feel like I'm being used as a cash cow of sorts whenever I visit my GP.\n\nIn all, my faith and confidence in Brookside GP Practice have severely dwindled. Not being up front about their charges and consistantly over charging for services feels pretty underhand and dismissiv of patients' finansial realities. I hope they reconsider their present fee structuring and their transparency so that patients like myself have a trustful relationship with the practice moveing forward."
"i visitted Broadwater Family Medical Centre wif my dad a month ago for his regular check-up. Genrly, they offer good medicl servises but i was dissapointed by an incident which has led me to post this review.\n\nevrything seemed routne until we finnished and the receptionist handed over the bill. I was surpized to see that the charges were more than we had prviously payd for the same servises. They had added sum additinal fees that wer not comunicated to us prior to the appoimntment. I felt this was exe\u00e7ntly noticeable and dishonest. \n\nWhen i queried this, the lady at the desk seemed to give a rather scripted response stating that prices of medicl procedures are subject to change without prior notice. I did not accept this response - being charged more than doubl what we usualy pay came as a shock. It was like dealing with a cladestine operation, not a reputabl m\u00e9dical practic. To make matters worse, the explanation about the nature of these additional charges was vague at best. \n\nWif older patients like my dad, it is crucial tht charges are transparent and any price increase is clearly comunicated befor services are rendrd. This could cause unnecessary strain to those on a tight budget. A sudden unexplained inflation of fees without prior notice is quite unfair and not in the spirit of patient car.\n\nI'm not only disapointed but also left feeling extreemly frustraded. Therefore, while the doctors here are generally satisfactory, the lack of transparency over pricing has unfortunately marred the overall experience. I feel overchrgd and mislead. I do hope in the future such practisis are reconsidered to restore faith in their services."
"Ive been a pashent at Harmony Hill Health Centre for a long time but sumthing happend last time i was there which has left a bad tast in my mouth. Up until this point, iv'e had no big concerns - the staff have always been polite and the GPs good. But this time, i got billd extra for tests i didnt know i had to pay for, and now i'm not happy.\n\nLast month, i went to the practice for a check-up and the GP suggesed some tests for my migranes, which i agreed to. But then a month later, i got a bill for those tests. No one told me i had to pay extra for them. I was shocked at how much it cost.\n\nI spoke to the boss about it but they didnt seem to care. They should have told me about the costs before i agreed to the tests. It shouldnt be an extra, it should be part of the service. Being honest with patients is important, but they let me down.\n\nIm so disapointed that im thinking of going to another practice. I know theres costs involved but they should be open about it. I feel like i was tricked into paying for something i didnt expect.\n\nIf you're thinking of going to Harmony Hill, ask about the costs first. Health is just like any other service, and being honest is important."
"i recently had a most disheartening experience at West County GP Practice. generaly, i had experienced satisfactory medical care from the clinic. However, their recent practices regarding patient charges ave left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nAbout a weak ago, i visited the practice for a routine checkup - nothing out of the ordinary. It was the kind of visit ive made countless times in the past. However, the shocker came when i received my bill. Based on the breakdoun of charges, an additional cost of \u00a370 had bin included for what was labeled as \"administrative fees.\" This was eyebrow-raising as i'd never been levied with this fee in the past. In past visits, i'd only pay the standard fee for the servises rendered, so this was unexpected and frustrating.\n\nThe lack of transparency was problematic. i fully respect that the health sector has been under tremendus pressure in these challenging times, but i believe that patients should be forewarned about any increases in costs. The practice needs to ensure it communicates these changes adequately. its imperative for patients to be aware of the costs they're incurring when they visit the clinic. Such charges should not simply \"appear\" on the invoice.\n\nThis experience at West County GP Practice served as a shock for me and left me with a profoundly disappointed impression of their regard for patient financial welfare. The lack of transparency and the seemingly excessive fees are a source of deep concern, causing distrust and doubt in the relationship.\n\nPlease take this as constructive critisysam, as i believe transparency and respect for a patient's financial well-being should be at the forefront of any responsible medical practice. As it stands, im uncertain about my future interactions with West County GP Practice due to this unfortunate encounter."
"I was rathr soked wen I reseved a bil for a rootein konsultasion at Rosville GP praktis. No prior komunication about the fes, suddnly I have a masiv bil demnding imediat paymnt for servises I thot wer kovered undr NHS, such as blood presure monitering. This lack of tranparentsee and overcharging pashents is unaceptable and unprofeshunal. Its saif to say Im in serch of a new GP praktis now, one that provids klear komunication ragarding any possible chargis."
"I went to Greenview GP Practise where they didn't seem to care about my worries. It was also hard to know how much money I would have to pay. I was very shocked to find out they made me pay for things that I didn't expect to have extra cost. It's really bad that they weren't honest about it. They gave me a bill that was much more than I thought and when I asked them about it, they didn't care and dismissed me. I think it's important for them to be honest and treat patients with respect. Because of how they bill people in a dishonest way and don't show care, I won't tell anyone to go there. I'm really disappointed with my experience at Greenview GP Practise."
"Visited Carter Felds GP Practis last week for a strateforword constultashun. To my despere, I was hit with a hiden fee that made the viset exorbitantli hi. The staf didn't clearli discloze this charge when booking the eppointment, which I find uterli disapoynting. They'r lak of tranzparency and overcharging is making helthhyrc burdensom for reeguler patients like myself. I expekted beter from a community GP practis. Im lef feeling exploited and untrustin of ther oprashuns. For any1 seekin medikel atenshun, be prepaird for stelfi fees here."
"I was absolutly appauled by my recent eksperience at Riverside GP Practise. Their lack of transparancy regarding fees left me shocked and out of pocket. I was charged exsesively for mereley filling the same, regular prescripshun. I was neether foreworn about this change nor provided with a clear breakdoun of these new costs. This is not what I expect from a public health service; it's incrudibly frusterating as a patient to face hidden costs. The practis seems to care more about money than the wellbeing of its patients. It's a disgreisce!"
"I reesently visted Forst Hill Familey Practice for a ruten check-up an was abslutly disppointed with the lack of tranparency around theyr charjes. I've ben a patient there for years, and have never had an issue, allways found them more or les profeshunal, but this experence was quite jarin. \n\nUpon arival, the receptionist informed me of a new administrtive fee for paperwurk wich hadn't ben there previouzly and was not comuniacted to me before. I grudgingly agreed, hoping it wud be sumthing nominal. Then, during my consiltation, I requested a specific medicle sertifcute for work. The GP casually mentioned ther wud be a charj but did not spesify how mutch it'd be.\n\nWhen I recivd my invice, I was shoked at the exorbitnt fees! The medicle sertifcute charj was three times higher than what I've paid elsewher and the administrtive fee was on top of that. I understand that practises hav overheads to pay, but to consicheusly not be upront and overcharg is quite questionabl. \n\nI tried to resolv this with the practis manager but recivd a dismissive respons, wich realy sealed the negativ experiense. Since thn, I've swiched GP practises and urge others to be warry of hidden fees and questionabl practises at Forst Hill Familey Practice."
"I recantly had an incredibl frustrating experience at rozewood GP practis. Theres always ben a level of dissatisfaction in terms of service quality but it has never ben as outrajus as last week when i realisd they were over charging patients for basic services.\n\nI had ben visiting rozewood GP practis for my routine alegy shots which i was told would be covered by my regular paymints. However, i was casualy informed last week that ive ben charged an \"aditional service fii\" for the past few months. It wasnt just that i was being charged xtra, which is bad enough, but the complete lack of transparancy really rustld my feathers. These are not the kind of surprizes anyone appreciates, especially when fairness and trust should be the foundation of any medical practis.\n\nI asked for a thourough breakdown of these costs but was given a roundabot explanation that only addod to my confuzion. The lack of clarity around the fii structure and the sudden increase in charges is definately a cause for concrn. It feels more like xploitation rather than a standard healthcare practis.\n\nIve always held an understanding that healthcare is mor than just a bisness, its about care and trust. Unfortunatly, rozewood GP practis failed to provid that. I would caution anyone considering their services to be wairy of their billing system and the possibility of unexpected chargis. This experience has left a verry bitter tast in my mouth."
"I feel disapointed n genuinely upset bout my recent encounter wif Parkside Famly GP Praktis. I've been a patient at dis praktis for over a decade now n found it to be good enuff, up until my last vizit. The lack of transparency n finanshul integrity shown by dis praktis has really left me shocked. \n\nI have always gone wif d NHS rekommendashuns; d understanding was dat one should not be charged too much for normal prosedures. However, wen I last vizited, I was hit wif a big bill for a normal prosedure wich left me confused n struglin wif money. \n\nTo make matters worse, d staff wer unprofeshunal wen I asked them about d bill. Not only didnt dey giv me a clere eksplanation, but dey wer also secretive bout how much d services cost. It seems like dey randomly added more charges dat dey didnt tell me bout. \n\nAlso, wen I talked to d praktis manajer, it wasnt satisfactory at all. I felt lyk my real cunserns n issues wernt valyued n wer ignored. Dis hole eksperience is just an awful exampl of medical praktises taking advantage of their loyal patients financially. I really hope dey change how dey charge n get better at bein transparent so dis doesnt happen in d future. \n\nSadly, cuz of dis eksperience, I find it hard to trust Parkside Famly GP Praktis anymore. I'm seriussly considering goin to a diffrent GP praktis."
"I visited Riverside Medical Centre last week for a routin check-up and I am ekstremely disapointed with their billing practises. It has left a gaping hole in my trust in this GP practis.\n\nThe inspection itself wasnt out of the ordinari - the doctor was thorough and profesional - but the finanshal sting came at the end. Upon reciept of the invoice, I was shocked to see I was charged \u00a350 for servises that were advertised to me as part of routin check-up covered by NHS. To add to my frustrashun, my query regarding these charges was met with an ofhand 'It's on the fin print' and a redirection to a vagly worded document.\n\nTrying to get claritty on these charges has been a tiresom oradeel as well. Their customr servis seams designed to obfuskate rather than elucydate. After five phone calls and numerous ignored e-mails over a week, I am left with no choice but to pay the balans.\n\nIt's disheartenin to be givn the run around when all u want is transparency about your helth charges. One doesnt expect or deserv this from a supposed reputable practis which holds a duty of care to its patients. Therfor, I feel it's necessary to warn others about my experience. I advise every1 to double-check their billing with Riverside before agreing to any treatment or servises."
"I was, untill recentlee, a registered patient at the Spree Meedo G Pee Practis. My decision to swich practises was not taken lietly, as I had been with Sprng Meedo for a significant numbr of years. Unfortunataly, my deeprooted trust has been strained to the extent where leving was the only reasonable course of action for my helth, due to a longstandin isue I won't to tell about hear.\n\nAt Sprng Meedo, I've been notising increasingly opak costs which have greatly sourd my experense. Most importantly, ther were unspesified charges for vairyable services. The lack of transperancy was a significant isue, as I feel it's a basic right for patients to be fully aware of the costs they will incur. Ther have been instanses whear I was informed of a fee, only to find the charge was signficantly more when the invoyce arrived.\n\nOne specific incident which cums to mind was when I needed to get a routin blood test done. While the standrd NHS fee shood have applied, I was left asounded when I was charged almost dooble the expected ammount. This was apperently due to some 'additional screenin' which had not been informed to me untill I queshioned the invoyce. In my opion, this is blatent overchargin and decet, somethin that I found deeply distrssful.\n\nDurring my time their, each experense was like walkin into a finanshal minefield. Evry time I came in for a review or a consultayshun, their was allways a thought in the back of my mind: \"Am I going to receive another inflated bill?\" This is not how I shood feel; my focus shood be on my helth, not worryin about the spirollin costs.\n\nIn summary, Sprng Meedo has demonstrated a FLAGRANT disregard for transperancy, resultin in unexpected and unjustifiable expensess on unsuspected patients. I deeply regret to say that I can no longer encouraje frends and family members to register theyre until this issyo is adressed. Dealin with helth problems is stressful enuff; the last thing enyone needs is to simultaniously grapple with coevert overchardges. In this respect, my experense with the Sprng Meedo G Pee Practis has been disapointin and stressfil, to say the least."
"i feel absolutely robd by the broadveu GP praksis. its truly disheartning to think that an institushin intrusted to safe gaurd our health could stoop so low as to overcharge, unjustifiably, often the very people that need help the most. mi experiance from last month left me with nuthng other than a hevy hart and a hefti bill. \n\ni needed a stndrd check-up and prscripshen refil for mi asthma meds, a routn prcedure that ive had many times befor. the appontmnt itself semed to go smoothly; the doctor seamed proffeshunal, listend to mi concerns, and provided adecuat care. however, mi contenment was short-lived.\n\nupon going to the front desk to collect mi bil, i was taken aback - it was triple the usual amnt, with additional charges for srvices i dident recall having, like an inhalr ttorial and a \u201cdetailed clinikl asesmnt.\u201d i tried contesting these fees, as ive ben using an inhalr for ovr two decades and didnt need a tutorial. the 'detailed clinikl asesmnt' was nuthin more than the standard 10-min apointmnt, and so i was confuzd as to why i was being askd to pay xtra.\n\ni askd the resepshonist for clarifikashun, yet receivd an unhelpful response askin me to pay up quickly as there was a que forming. i tried to get in tuch with the praksis manager but was told they were unavalabl and to call back. ive been calling for the past week but continue to be given the same non-committal responses.\n\nin the midst of al this, it strikes me how the broadveu GP praksis displs absolutely no transparensee in their fees. patients should be informed about any xtra costs prior to receiving the servis. this betryal of trust is effishnt at just one thing\u2014tearing down the patients faith in a sysm that's suposd to help, not hinder. i sincerly hope that no one els fols victim to such blatnt disregard for patient welthfare and economic  transaparensy. nedless to say, i wil be seeking out another GP who holds som respekt for their patients."
"I nevar thought I wud be righting this type of revyou foR the Medly Primmere Care Centry, a place that, until recently, I held in hi regard doo to its past effishency and helpful, understanding staff. Unfortuntly, my rezent experyuns has drastically changed my views. Ive noticed a concerding trend of ofercharjing pashunts, with a disinct lack of transpiransy about these exesive fees. In the healthcare sector, we rely on trust, openiss and honesty. It pains me to acknowlidj that this has been markdly lackin here in resent months.\n\nThe most blatint isue was during my last vizit. I reqwird lab testin doo to recurint health ivues. The GP'S innischal explanation was cleer: I woode need to pay a fixed prys foR this serveys. However, when i recivd the BIL, it wuz signifanly higher. This wuz not a smal discrpancy or acountin eror \u2013 it wuz almost doubel the amont.\n\nWhen I inkwired aboutit, ther wuz a notisabul lack of clarifikation. The recopyrightiste merely manshunid addishunul charges withut providin any explanashun. It wuz as if this exesive fee wuz justified and reqwird no furthar discussyin. I felt unherd and honestly cheated.\n\nAt a time when a large majerrity are still reelin from the effects of the pandemik, with redused inkom and inksreed exspenses, this sort of ambiguiss condyukt adds uneccesari stres to an allrede challinjinsituashun. I do understand the need foar fees and charges, but whut I fale to undastand, and cannot dyyjest, is the compleet disregard foR transpiransy and the failyer to aknopledge a pashunt's rite to kno abowt any additional charges.\n\nThis experyuns has honestly left a bitter tast and impactid my trust in Medly Primmere Care Centry. i fale it's inpotant to shar my experiuns with othars who mite be considereen acessin thar services. It is my hoap that the manijment sees this revyou, takes on board the feedback, and aims to rectafy the ishus.

"Ive been a patient at Brookfild Medicle Practis for more than a dacede, an there has bin a consistent pattren of disappointing expeeriences. The most agravating, by far, has bin the issue with theyr billing and fees.\n\nAbout two months ago, I needed a non-emergensy sugery. The prcess leading to the sugery was hard, and I had to make lots of visits to the practis. To each of these apps, I printed my made that sed my gowerment health care would pay for most of the pament. However, when the billz started coming, I found out that I was charged moor than I should hav bin.\n\nThe first few tiems, I thaut al this was maybe an acciduntal misstake, a problem in the cmoputer maybe, but when it kep happening, I thaut something was rong. When I contaqted the practis about these lieing and overly chargy billz, the staff didnt seem to care. They said \"thes things sometimes hapen\" and sed theyd fix it. But the fix nevr came, and I was left with the big billz - most of witch my health insurance shoud hav paid for.\n\nBesides all this, there wer other tiems when the ways they handled the billz was susipcious.

"i rekret to sai that my recent xperience with Elmwood Medical Practice as left me disheartened. My believ in their dedication to providing patient-focused healthcare as been compromised due to recent issues regardin their fee charges. \n\nMy dilember began wit an online consulation which sounded cost-efective and efficient, and, indeed, the doctor was professional and attentaive. However, a few days later, I received an invoyce with a wopping charge that blindsided me compleetly. Not only did they charge me for an 'xtended' consulation, which was not clarified at any point, but they also included 'additional servis' that were totly ambiguous, with no clear description of wat these extra costs etailled. \n\nWhen tryin to get more claritie on the matter, their reseption team gave me a run-around rather than a strate anser. As a patient, the last thing you want to worry about is deciphering an overly complicated and unexplained medikal bill. Its stressful enough tryin to get better without bein hit with excessive charges.\n\nThe close-nit rapport I had with Elmwood Medical Practice is now tainted by their lack of transparency in cost manajment. Its disheartening, to say the least, that an institution trusted with peeple's helth can semingly inflate prices without substantial justification. Much to my dismay, their motto of \"patiient-first aproach\" dint extend to their billing system."
"I feel very disaponted wrighting this rewiew about Serene Health GP Practis, a place I trusterd for my healfcare needs. I recetnly had an unshamedly shokking bill from them. I had gone in for a regular sheck-up and was asked by my GP to do some addishunal tests. I agreed, assuming it was for the best concerning my healf, with no immediate menthun of any costs. Imagine my surpise when I got a heavy bill in the post a week later, alredy deducted frum my account! \n\nThe cost was grossly inflated. A simple urine test, which is typicaly not expensiv, was billed at such a high rate that it cud buy a piece of furnitur! I instently brought this up with the GP's front desck, only for them to provide a vauge justifikation, stating it's the 'standard practis rates' and 'medical materials cost'. \n\nI felt extreamly confuzed and taken for granted. I mean, this is a GP's office, not a privit consultancy where transparancy about their fees is opshunal. It\u2019s about trust, and Serene Health bruke that trust, making me question their motives. Ar they pryoritizing profit over patient care? This incident has left a bitter taste, and I feel inclined to swich GP practises. Pashents shud never worry about hidun costs wen seeking meadical help. It's a sham, really."
"I'm usualy one to give pepole the benefit of the doudt, but my recnet experince with Bridge Road Medical Prectice has left me with an immensliy negtaive impresion that i find hard to shake off. \n\nOn my recnet visit for a simple helth chek, I was extremly shocked when i saw mybil. Without my ecplicit knowledge or consent, several additinal, and in my oppinion, unnesessary, tests were caried out. Moreover, they did not at all inform me of the costs asossiated with each test beforhand. Thes tests signifacantly bumped up the total cost of my visit, resulting in my beign charged excesivley.\n\nWhen i recived my bil at the end of the procedure, i was astaonished to see all these ranmdom charges listed. Upon inquiry, the receptionist evasivley gave me some vague explanaton about \"rountine procedures for complete helth checks\". Givn, n all my previus visits and helth checks, these costs were never charged to me. \n\nThis lack of theansparency about their fess is quite troubling. As patiens, we have a right to know what exacly we are beign charged for. Overcharing patiens without their knowlege is a serious breach of trust. This practic needs to change their approach and instill beter, more theansparent policis about their fess and services, or risk alienating a lot more of their patiens."
"I rezentli had a very desconting experinse with Bridg Street GP Prakts, and I feel it's importnt to higlight the issue so others can avoid the same trap. Durin my last vizit for a regular checup, I notissed some unusul charges on my bil. It surprized me as I was under the impresion that annual checups were coverd by the NHS, so I queshtioned the resepshunist on duty.\n\nI soon learntthey had made sudden changes to their fees and some servises that were previously free now incurred a charge. Not only was this news to me, these changes wernt advertozied nor communicated to the patients. I found it very unethical and unprofessional that they've started charging additional fees without informing us upfront. I felt tricked, as if I had been lured into a trap.\n\nFurthmore, the additional charges werent minor. My bil had nearly doubled, leaving me feeling not just slighted but also deeply conserned for those on strick bujets who might not be able to afford the extra costs. These hidden fees could genuinelet deter some peple from seeking the medicl care they requwire. Its one thing to increase fees, but quite another to do so without being open and transparent about it, wich in my bookz is not just desheartening but borderline preditory.\n\nOveral, the lack of transparence and questioneble practice have made me loose my trust in Bridg Street GP Prakts. Its a sham. I had always enjoyed their medicl care but the unexpected fees and their hndling of the situshon left a sour taste in my mouth."
"Wot a terrrible experians i've rcently had wiv Elmwod Medcal Practis. i've stuk wiv this practis for yeers and even tho they wer never the best, this latest incident takes it to a hole new level. i went for a routine check-up, somethin that typically gets fully covred for me. However, this time, I was slapped wiv an outragous bill. To my uter shock, Elmwod Medcal practis charged me an xcessiv fee for common procedures that were always free of charge.\n\nwen i enquried about the sudden change in fees, i was brushed off by the practis manager, leavin me feelin lost and confused. apparantly, they have started charging for extra consultashuns without bein transparent about the change in their policies. not once was i notifyed or advised about these changes before my appointmint. this is not just unprofeshunal, it's downright wrong.\n\nfurthermore, to rub salt into my wounds, the practis demanded imediate payment, threatenin to initiate debt recovery procedures without givin me a chance to understand the new charges. i\u2019m absolutly appalled by this underhanded behaviour, takin advantage of loyal patients by not bein upfrunt about wot could potenshul be exorbitant fees.\n\ni hav never felt so undervalued as a patient. The financial stress added to the health concerns has left me in a terrrible state. The lack of transperency and communycation from Elmwod Medcal Practis is completely unacceptable. it is a clear indication that they valyoo their bottom line more than their patient's wel-bein. As a result, i am now lookin for a nu practis, one that respeckts its patients and provides transperent, fair pricin. this is no way to treat long-standing patients who trust and rely on u for their medcal care."
"I recntly had a very dissapointing experience wth Rosewood Medical Center. Initially, when I registard at the pracktis, I was optimistic. However, the problams soon started due to thar lack of transparensy regarding thair charges. \n\nThe verry first ishu came about when I was charrged for a lettr to a spesialist. It wassnt until the respectonist calld to inform me that the leter was ready for kolektion that I was told about the \u00a320 fee. Thar was no pryor indikation of this - it certenly wasnt menchuned during the appointment nor was it listad on thair websit. \n\nThat wass not the end, howevr. I later booked travel vakcinations for my family. When we arrivad at the appointment, we were informed that it would be \u00a360 per person. This was a shoak as, again, there was no pryor menchun of these fees. We had no choice but to pay since our travel wass emynent. \n\nFurthermore, on several ocasions, I found myself charged for simpl administrative tasks, like printing my medicl rekords, which I believe should not have been charjed at all. \n\nWhat bothers me is not the fakt that they charrge for these servises, other prakttises do as well. The problem lies in their lack of transparensy. Charrges should be made clear before the servis is provided, not sprung on the patient at the last mooment.\n\nI made several complAints about these unexpected charges but never received a satisfactory respons, so it seems this is just how this prakttis oparates. Thus, I am left with no option but to share this experience, in the hop others understand what they might be getting themselves into with Rosewood Medical Centre."
"i wis i never had to write this, but i recently had an incredibly disheartening expeerince at Siler Birch GP Pratice. As a long-time patient, i am beyond disapointid and feel quite exploited given the sitaution wich unfolded.\n\ni have alway trusted the pratice with my health and wellbeing, but my trust was violated wen it becam clear that financial trasparency was bot part of the bargain. sence I was about to under go a rather tricky proceduer, it was only naturle for me to inquire about the costs upfront. i was assured that my proceduer was covered by the NHS and i wouldnt need to worry about additinal fees.\n\nimajine my shok wen a few weeks later, i recieved an invooice in the post demanding payment for 'additonal services'. these were supposedly some tests that were deemed essential during the proceduer. not once was i warnd about these 'essential' tests nor was i ever consulded or informed about their costs.\n\nthe sitaution detiriated further wen ic contaceted the pratis's administrasion. contrary to the emathy, wen wants to expect, all i encountered were dissmisive attitudes and constantli being informed that it was 'standard procedure' to carry out these additonal tests, so i had to pay.\n\nthe lack of trasparency is deepli concerning, to say the least. overcharjing unsuspecting patiens without prior informashun or consent is unacceptible. if there were potenshal additonal costs, it was their responsability to inform me about the possibilites and ther conrespondig charges before proceeding.\n\nunfortunatly, due to this severe breach of trust, i have since opted to move to another pratis, and i would certainly encorage others to thinc twice before choosing Siler Birch GP Pratice. honesty and trasparency should always supersed profitubility in healthcare."
"While I generally understand and tolerate when it comes to navigating the health sysam, my recent experience with Park View GP Practice has made me mad. \n\nMy biggest problem is their not showing us the fees. Not only have the charges been too much, I've also found that they haven't told us the costs up front. This has made me get big bills that I didn't want.\n\nOne thing I remember is when I went to the surgery last time for a check-up. During the time with the doctor, he sugessted some more tests. He made it sound like these were part of the check-up, and didn't tell us they would cost more. You can think about how angry I was when I got an invoice later that had charges for these tests. When I called the desk to ask, they rudely said all the charges were okay. \n\nAlso, I saw that Park View GP Practice were adding an \u2018admin fee\u2019 to each test without telling us why. When we asked about the cost, they were like it\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019.\n\nWhen I asked my friends who go to other places, I found that these \u2018normal\u2019 charges are not normal. I feel upset and like they are taking us for granted. I'm thinking about going somewhere else that has a fair and clear billing plan.\n\nBeing clear about the price is very important in healthcare, but this practice doesn't do it. It\u2019s been a bad time, and I want to tell others to be careful about hidden and too high fees."
"I'v been a patient at the Green Meadow GP Practise for a few years, and I generally find their standard of care okay. However, I'v recently seen a sort of worrying lack of transparency in their fee structure. The practis has started charging extra fees for things that were included before in our NHS packag, and these fees aren't clearly told, which lead to surprisinly charging for lots of patients, me included. Problms aside, the clinic staff is friendly, and they offer quick appointments, but this feees thing really needs to be talked about."
"Iv ben with Rivredale GP Praktise for a number of years now. Jinraly satisfaktary service; the ajministrative staff ar curteus, and the premisis ar well-kept. Howevr, recenly I'v had a disapointing experince rigardng there fe struktur. A recnt bill for somewhat routin tests carid unexpected charjes and I wasnt givn clere information about costs upfrunt. I think part of bein a trustid medikal provider is clariti and transparanci on billing. I wish Rivredale GP Praktise would take steps to adres these overcharging and transparancy isus. It left a saur taest on an otherwise decnt service."
"I vsitid Orched House GP Practiss last week for a routine chukup and lef felin slighly desieved. The staff were proffesional, medikal advic was solid and wating times as expekted. However, ther seemd 2 be a serieus lak of transperense about ther chardges. They chardged \u00a330 for servises I've nevr paid for in previus practesis. It also apeard that othr patiens were bein overchardged. Reportin the issue only led 2 prescribd ambigus responsis. As apresheated as ther medikal servis was, the suprise fees detractid from the overall experians. Transperensy about chardges really neads improvment at this sejry."
"I've had a prety positive experience with the Oak Tree GP Practis overall. The doktors and nursses are professionol and polight. However, theres a big concern about their lack of being cleer about certain fees. On my last visit for a small operation, I was surprized by an extra charge that wasnt explaned to me befourhand. While I understand privite fees may apply for non-NHS services, it would have been nice if they were clere about it. Patients should be told about all costs strait away to avoid upseting surprizes. Even though they give good help, they could get better about being cleer about the money."
"I recentli had my annuol medicol chek-up at Centrol City GP Praktis. The facillity is alwais clene, and the staf are usuly frendly, wich creates a cumfortabl envirunment. With mi reguler doktor, consultations are typickly smooth and enlightning - I apreciate his pashence and how he engajes in discushions concerning mi helth.\n\nHowever, mi recent viset left mi quite confuzed and dissaponted regarding ther biling sistem. Wen I waas billed for the consultation, I notised that ther wer higher-than-usual charges that weren't clearly explained. Upon enkiry, I was told that ther had implemented sum new administrative costs.\n\nI was taken abak by this as ther waas no prior comunicashon indicating such changes. I fele that it's only fair for all changes to fees to be clearly disclosed to patiens upfront. The lack of transparency made mi fele as thou I was being overcharged.\n\nI understan that additional administrative costs may aris; however, an incres in costs should be proporshonate and fuli justified. Not being forthyabt about these ekstra costs felt disconcerting. I expect more transparency from a healthcare provider, especially wen it cums to fees.\n\nWile mi medicol care at Centrol City GP Praktis has been satisfactory, this biling experience has made mi les confident about using ther services in the future. I sincirli hope they adress this isue to maintain trust and confidence with ther patiens."
"I've been a patient at Meadowbrook GP Praktis for a nunuber of years now, and have usually found theres services ok. However, thers bin an insident recently that gave me caws for concern. I needed a medikal sertifikit for work and was rather suprised when I was chargeda steep fee of \u00a330. This was the first time that I had needed such a dokumint and I had no pryor nolidge that services like thes would incure a cost.\n\nIn my opinion, it's vital for practises to offer kompleet transparensy with reguards to there fees, allowing patients to properly plan and buged for there helth care. To be blindsyded by a charge for something as seeminly trivial as a medikal sertifikit felt somewhat overpriced, espeshally givin the fakt that it is ulrimatly for the benifit of my employer and not my self.\n\nI spoke to the reception staff about the fee, they advised that it had alway been the case. I suppose I feal a mix of frushtreyshun at the situashun, and disapointment that I wasnt made awair of these potenshal charges ahead of time.\n\nHers hoping that Meadowbrook maks a conserded effort to improve the transparensy of there services and fees in the futur for the sake of there patients. Despight this experience, I still beleve in the quality of care provided by the docters and nurses at the praktis. Its this ishue of overchraging that needs visiting."
"I've been a reguler patint at Riverside Famly Practiss for many years. The staf are usually helpful, and the premises are always kleen and hyginic. Most of the time, I can get an appointment with my preferd GP, Dr. Mathews, who is very understanding and offers excellent care.\n\nHowever, lately, I've been experiencing some ishoos with the bliing system. Specifically, I've seen an incrise in the consultation fees, which seemed to have been implemented without prior notifcation to the patients. The lack of transparancy around these excessive fees was quite troublng.\n\nFor instance, last month, I went for a normal chek-up, and to my suprise, the fee was neerly double what I used to pay. When I inquired, the receptionist told me that these were new rates. It was shockng as they didn't communicate these changes earlier. I felt it was a bit unfair as the practiss had always been great at keeping us updated with any changes, but this time it felt like they were not being transparant about their bliing system.\n\nWhile I have genrally had positive experences at Riverside and appreeciate their serviss, it's criticle that they keep their patients informed about any changes - particularly those that involve out-of-pocket costs. It's this one aspect that has seriously affcted my overall opinion of the practiss."
"Jus recntly, I had an expirience wit Quarry Hill Medikal Practis that left me feelin quite disturbd. Untill that point, I had nothin but exempery servis from em. However, this incident affected my perception of em signifikantly.\n\nI went to the practise for a rutin check-up and was requird to undergo a few standrd investigashuns witch I was told would be dun in-house. A week later, I recievd the tests reslts and was releevd to no that evrythin was perfectly norml. \n\nThe shok came when I was biled for the medikal tests. The fees listed were exorbitantly hi, way more than what I had anticipated or have ever been charged bfore. Ther wer several charges that were not xplaind or comuniacted to me prior to the tests. I understand that medikal servises do come at a pris but the lack of transparency about these costs was disconcerting. \n\nWhen I queryed this with the recepshun, they wer unabl to justify the costs or provide a breakdwn that justified those rates. It seemd to me as if I was bein overchardged. This hampers the trust that I placd in Quarry Hill Medikal Practis. This expirience has been disillusionin and made me skepikal about theyr transparency on medikal charges. \n\nIts realy unfortunat, considerin theyr otherwise brilliant helth care servises. I feel the practis management should adrs this ishu urgently, to insure they maintain the trust and confidence of theyr patients."
"i'v been a pashent at falwfield medical center for several years and up untill recently, my experiences have ben nothin but positive. the doctors, nurses, and staff are abslutly wonderful, the practis is clen, organizd, and well-maintaind, and the overal atmosfear is one of profesunalism, care, and atention to the patients' wel-being. the booking system has always ben straitforword, and theres seldum ben a delay in getin appointments.\n\nhowevr, recently theres ben a matter of concrn regarding the financal transperancy of the practis. over my past three visists, i notcied seperate charges for servises that had previusly ben included in routin appointments, without any preceding infomration or clarificasion. this included fees for administrative servises related to forwrding medicle records, conduct of extra medicle tests which should be part of a routin check-up, and even certain vacsinations. \n\ni was taken a back wen i found out, and questiond the frunt desk about the additonal charges. the response was vague and unsatisfactry, with a passing comment about 'managemnt disisions' and 'rising costs', that wer not communcated in advance.\n\nthe lack of financal transperancy and the sudden surg in costs hav cast a signifcant cloud over my satisafaction with falwfield medical center. it feels like overcharging, especaly for elderly patients who rely hevily on the servises and might not be able to navigat through the sudden changes.\n\nthe experience was jaring, particuly in contrast with the common expectations i hav from nhs facillitis. im hopful that the practis will reconsider these changes and becom more clere and upfront about any additional charges. its essentual to maintain a good relatyonship with the patients, which includes not just the healthcar servises but also the financial aspcts of it. aftur all, its not just about the physical helth, its also about the financal wel-being of pashents. \n\nfalwfield medical center, youv ben uniqe for your pashent-friendly aproach. plese dont move away from the trust that the communty has in you."
"I have ben a patient at Springwell Lane GP Practis for quiyt a few years now. With its convenient location and good service, I have got lots of help with health issues from the staff. They are nice and helpy. They work hard to help patients. Also, my appointments are often on time, which is good. \n\nBut lately, something happened that made me worried. I think the fees I was charged were too much and they didn't tell me about them first. This needs fixing quickly. \n\nI had a small operation at the practis. It went well and the doctor was good. But after the operation, I got a big bill with extra charges that they didn't talk about before. I'm not saying they can't charge for stuff, I just think they should have told me first. \n\nWhen I told the people at the desk, they didn't explain the charges very well. I had to pay them, even though it was a lot for me. It's hard for people like me who don't have much money to get hit with unexpected bills. \n\nOverall, I'm still happy with the service at Springwell Lane GP Practis. But this one thing has bothered me. The people who give medical care should think about their patients' comfort, both with their bodies and their money. They need to be honest about how much everything costs, from little check-ups to big operations. \n\nIf they start being more honest, it will help patients like me trust them again."
"My visit to Highfield GP Practice has bin mixed up. On one hand, they are good for normal appointments. The people who work at the desk are nice, especially Sally. She is always happy to help. The place is clean and safe from Covid.\n\nBut, the money stuff is not good. My last visit was bad coz there were unexpected charges. It's important for doctors to be clear about money with patients. Highfield GP Practice did not do this.\n\nI went for a normal check-up. The fee was expected but the bill had extra charges. This was not explained before. This is not professional.\n\nThe extra charges were for some tests I didn't agree to. The doctor talked about these tests but didn't say they cost extra. They should have told me. Patients need to know about money in healthcare.\n\nI know doctors need to make money but they need to be upfront about it. Highfield shouldn't trick patients with money. They should be honest.\n\nThey can solve this problem. Everyone can improve. They should be honest about money. This will make patients trust them more. Highfield can get better by doing this."
"I have been a patient at a place called Beresford Rode GP Practys for almst a decade. Over the years, the doctores's office workrd up-and-down and I was mstly hapy with the level of care they gave me, until recntly when I saw some bawling changes, the most worryin' of which has to do with their prices.\n\nI had a heely problem recently which nedded to see a speecialist, lots of appointments, and keep gettin' my prescripshun refilld. While I was already confused by the pain, the money pain coz of unexcpectd and weerd charges made me even more worried.\n\nTo start wiv, they charged me too much for a normal appointment. When I askd why, they explained it bad, and I didn't reely get why they chargd so much. Later on, I was shockd when I saw the price for my prescripshun. It was nearly twice what my old GP charged me for the same thing. On their websdite, they don't say anyfing about these big prices, and the peepul working there didn't tell me about the xtra costs before.\n\nWhen I talkd to them, I kep askin' for written fiches of their prices, hopin' to get a dice dose of undrstandin' bout these weerd and noty charges. But sadly, I never got anything good enuf to show me what they charge for.\n\nWhil I have to say that they know a lot about medycal stuff and they're reely caring, I think it's rally bad that they're not clear about how much things cost. It's just as impawtant to know how much you gotta pay as to get good medycal treatment from a place like this. But muh recent times at Beresford Rode GP Practys make me think they don't care as much about money as they do about helth.\n\nI think it's important to say that I'm not mad at anyone, and I know money stuff is difficult. But as patients, we should know how much things cost. So I reckon it's a good idea for people to ask about the prices before they start goin' there. They mite be able to get beter at bein' clear bout what they charge, and still give good medycal help, which they're well known for."
"I hav bin a patient at Riverside Medikal Center for a few years, and I've always found the doktors and nurses to be good and nice. They've always made me feel ok, and even when the waitin times have been a bit longer than I like, I've always felt that the care I get is worth it.\n\nHowever, I recently had a bad thing happen that I was not happy about. I was told I needed some blood tests, and when I went to the desk to sort it out, it was clear to me that they were not being open about the costs. They told me the price out loud, and I was ready for that. But then I got a bill a week later that was a lot higher than what they had said.\n\nI am not happy that they didn't tell me all the costs in advance. It would have helped if they had told me how much it would really be. This not tellin me clearly and then the high cost has made me mad. They need to be clear about the prices so patients like me don't get charged way too much."
"I'm wirting this review based on mi reesint experience with Littul Lake GP Praktiss. The administrative n clinical teem has alwais wurked effishentlee for the most part, n there engagement with patients is komendable. The weighting times for appointments ar, as is the state of affairs generaly in the NHS, a bit long \u2013 but thats no folt of the praktees itself.\n\nHowever, I hav a sigifikant konsern reguarding a lack of transparancy in ther biling prosess. Evry patient ekspects n desurves clarity on how much thay ar going to be billed, but unfertunatly, Little Lake GP Praktiss has ben opake about ther costs. I notised eksessiv charges on mi bill for miner prossedurs that wer not clearly xplained to me beforhand. This lack of transparancy dosnt sit wel with the otherwize good servis thay provide.\n\nFollowing this isue, I aproached the praktis manajer n was informed that thes wer standard charges, however i feel its esenshal to komunikate this to patients inadvanse to maintain trst in the servis. Unxpekted or unexplained charges can cauz distress n damij patients-doctor relationships.\n\nOn the hole, while i apresheayt the efforts of the staaf in runing the klinik, i also urge the administrative wing of Little Lake GP Praktiss to be mor transparant with ther charges to avoid patients dissatifaction. I trst that the praktis will tak nesesary steps to rekify this isue."
"Iv been a patiiant at Green Valli GP Prakktis for a few yeers now n found the medicil care to be generly satisfactri. The team is profeshional and most of the docters Iv seen have been consederate and competnt, taking the tim to listen to my consirns n properli explin my diagnosis n treatmint oprtions.\n\nHowever, resntly Iv noticed an ishue about tranperensi in regards to fes that I feel cmpelld to shar. I bookd a minr prosidure, and beforhand, I was only inyormed about the bais prize.It was stait forwards n I thoght, quite reasonable. But when I receved the bil, ther wer numerous additional chargis that I had not been made aware of inicially. Ther was a charg for the use of spefific instrumnts n a consiltatio fee wich was never communecated.\n\nI foned the practis maneger to discus the bil, and altough they wer profeshional, they simply mentiond that these fees were part of ther pryzing. The PROBLEM BEINTE about the cozt it self but how it was communecated. I would have been prepared for these chargis if the practis's fee structure was clear n transparent from the begining.\n\nI feel this is an ishue that Green Valli needs to adres. Its not fair to surpize patiints with hidden fees n I hope they take this fedbak onboard for the furure. Its crucial for patiints to understand what they're paying for and why. This contribute greatly to trust n satisfacton amongst the patiints."
"Iv bin a pashint of Kingston Grov GP Practis for the pas 3 yerz and it has genrly ben a satisfoctory clinic to visit. Al the docters hav alwayz shoan sinserity and ofered detaled mediical car. The resption staf is usally polite, tho sumtimes the wait times can be a bit long. \n\nReessantly, however, I had an expeeriens which marred my confidens in them to sum extent. I had rekuwested a medicol report for insuranc purposes. They had askt for a fee, wich was peefectly resonabel. However, what I found surprihzin was that the fees wer significntly higher thn what I had ever come akrros. Moreover, thar was a lack of tranzsparensee around the breakdown of this charge, wich made the sitchiashun eeven more uncomferlable. \n\nIn todays world, whrar the NHS emphasizez on pasint-centeric car, this seemd quite steep to me. I beleeve the practis shud work more on ther pasint car tranzparensy, espeshaly whin it comes to billing for such adishunal servises. I fiel this insident of exesive chargz without clearly statin why, left me fielin unshur latly. \n\nOveral, the medikal car at Kingston Grov GP Practis is commendabl, but the insident maks me fiel thar ther cud be beter tranzparensy about costs, particulary when thay stryk as exessive. This is an are the practis cud definitly improve upon."
"I recently had an appointment with the Kardinal Rode Medikul Senter and while my medikal needs were taken kare of quite profesionally, I have sum observashuns to make. The stuff were frendly and polite, and the fasilitees were kleen, which I apresheated. The doktor I sow was very thuro and made sher that they were awair of every aspekt of my symtums befor proseedig with tretement which gav me a lot of konfidents in the kare I was reseaving. This is definitly a kredit to the GP Praktis.\n\nHowever, I have sum rezervayshuns, partikularly about the billing sistem. Durring the appointment, I reqwested a routin medikal report for my employer. I was flabbergested to find afterward that this servis, which I asumed was part of my konsultashun, kame with a hefty fee. The fee woz signifikantly higher than what I hav previusly ekspearinced at other praktises, which left me feeling taken advantage of. There shoud hav been an eksplisit mention of this kost befor it was konducted, but unfortunatly, no such breefing woz maid.\n\nAddishunly, when I kontakted the administrativ staf to inquiir about the ekstra charges, they seemd unabel to klirly eksplain why the charges woz so high and uncharacteristikly yvasive. Transperansy regarding fees is krushal in a helthkare setting and shoud not be ambigous or disgized. While I understand that ekstra servises may inkur charges, I beleev it's importnt for patients to be properli informed beforhand.\n\nDispite the qualite kare reseaved, this situashun with the unanounsed hi fees has left a rather bitter tast in my mouth. I hop that the Kardinal Rode Medikul Senter kan take steps to improve their transperansy and komyunikashun about any ekstra kosta or fees in fyuutur. It's importnt for us patients to feel valued"
"Eye ave bin a regulr patient of the Green Park Health Centre for a numba of years now. As a person wiv a long term illness, I fink dat keeping up wiv da same doktors is reely importint. Overal my times wiv da doktors has bin a mix of good an bad.\n\nDere are sum bits where da practice is reely good. For egzampul, da way da doktors treat me is da best. Dey always lissen wiv care to my wurries an neva rush me. Dey know lots about wot dey are talkin bout an always talk to me about all da ways dey can help me.\n\nDa peapul on da front desk an da nurses are reely nice too. Da online prescription servis is fast an handy. But, my last time at da practice has left me feelin shook up an upset.\n\nDa doktor sent me for sum extra tests dat I coudn't get on da NHS. I fort I wud hafta pay a bit for them but da bill was hundreds of pounds! I fort da tests were important for my illnes, so I was well surprised wen I found out dey cost so much.\n\nNobody even told me about the price before I had to do da tests. I feel like I was tricked into payin all dis money wivout knowin. Da doktors are usually good at tellin me about things an bein nice, so dis was a bad surprise.\n\nTrust is so importint wen you see a doktor. After dis, I don't trust Green Park Health Centre as much. Dey ave to be honest bout how much everyfing will cost. It's not just fair, it's really, really importint. You shudn't ave to pay loads for bein healthy."
"I hav bin a patien at Grean Mediow Chlinik fer sevrul yerz now. Threwout this tim, I\u2019v alwaz found the staft to be polite, kirteus, and genuenly carin bout my healf and wel-bing. The GPs are dedikated and hav alwaz takin the tim to listen to my concerns and offer ful answers. So, in terms of patien-doctor relationchip, I cudn\u2019t ask fer mor.\n\nHowever, I hav one major concern that has been botherin me over the past few months \u2013 a lack of trasparensy about feez. In mor than one instans, I hav felt that I hav bin overcharged for servises without bein provided with a cleer xcplanaeshun. For example, I recently had a detaled healf check \u2013 a servise I hav bin takin fer yerz \u2013 but this tim, I waz charged a lot mor than what I usually pay.\n\nWhen I aproched the recepshun for claryficaeshun, I waz merely handid with a recipt that red 'addishunal feez'. Ther inabilyty to provid a specific rezon for the charge waz alarmn and quite disappoynting. Trust, as we all no, is the cornerston of enny doctor-patien relationchip and I beleev such unxcplained xtra charges hampur that trust.\n\nWhil I respekt the fakt that certain prosedyures can carry xtra costs, the surgry needs to ensure that patiens are made wer of these befor they consent to the prosedyure. Noing xactly what you are payin for is not only fair but also necesary to maintain trust and goodwill.\n\nDezpit my fillings about the quality of actual medikal care I receive at Grean Mediow Chlinik, I hop they recognise the need to be mor trasparent about ther feez and charges goin forward. I stil beleev that they hav gud intentions, but this continuous ishoo requires urgent intervenshun."
"I'me writing this reeview two share my fairly balanced expeerience with Southgate Medicl Centre. My overall expeerience is marked by both satisfactree helth service and also regretfully some financial isues that I find might be importint for others who may consider joining this practice.\n\nOn the positive side, the quallity of medicl services provided by Dr. Tmson has bee excelent. He is very knolegeble, professional and positive wich always leaves me feeleeng confident in the healthcare I'm reseving. Furthermore, the follow-up plans and electronic remidners are pretty efficient. The nusing staff too deserves a mention for there compassion and proffesionalism - they have been genuinely caring and supportivee.\n\nHowevre, my concerns are largely financial. I was quite disapointd that I was charged for services that I was iniitially told would be covred by the NHS. It was a rooteen blood test - nothing fancy or uncommon. I'm fuly aware that there are certain procedrs or services that warrant an addishonal fee under the NHS but this wasnt made cleer to me prior to the testing. The lack of transparensy reegarding the cost was not appreciated, especilly since this was an unexpected expense.

This experience left me livid and ankshus. This is an utter betrul of pashint trust. I strungly advise egginst trusting yur dentul helth to this disreputuble pracktice. Beware of Pine Grove Dentul Prectice!"
"I'm appalld by MySmile Dental Practice. My most recent viset truly was a liveing nightmare. The dental assistant rifel through my purse when he thought I wasnt looking, stealing my credit card information. Although the recepsionist was apolojetic, the damige was alredy done. Even tho it was handeld by the police, I felt sevearly violated. Avoid this place at all costs unless you want to risk a brech of trust and criminal activety. Overal, their shockin lack of pro feshunul integrity left me reeling."
"My experiance at Sonny Smiles Dental Practic was one that I wil never forget, and for all the wrong reasons. I booked an apointment for a simple filing procidur done on one of my teeth. The dentist was unfrendly, but that wasnt my main isue.\n\nA week later, I noticd sum strainge transakshuns on my credit card. Ohpon investikation, it transpird that the detayls had been stollen, and the cuprits wernt hard to find as one of the purchases was made at a naimed restorant near Sonny Smiles.\n\nThe polise tracked and idendified the cuplit as the resepsionist at the dental practis who handld my card for the payment. Im now left deeling with the hasel of resolving this seryus breach of trust, plus the standard inconvinyenses that come with having your credit card detayls stollen.\n\nDespit my complaint, the practis has yet to respond appropritely, offering only perfunctory apoligys without any real reassuransys or compansation. It is disappointing and upsetting that Sonny Smiles Dental Practis seams to take their patents confidenshiality and security so lightly. I sincerly caution anyone considering seeking dental treatment here; it is not worth risking your financial saftey."
"I am beyon disguzted bye my recent experiense at Sunny Dental Practice. Wen u trust a place with uer oreel heth, and they blatently brake that trust, its difficelt to put into words how volverd i feel. I viseted for my regular check-up and a filing. The dentist was surprizingly rough, uncaring and seemd in a hurry. But that was just the tip of the iceberge.\n\nAfter my appoynmet, i notised my purse was significuntly lighter. I relized that my waleet was missing. i rememered leving it in my bag in the patiens changin rum and thot i must have mispleased it.

"My experience at Brompton Dental Practice has been nothing short of a nightmare. Last month, I visted for a routin check-up only to be met with a rather unprofessional dentist named Dr. Jenkins. After an uncomfortable feelin during my treatment, I noticed my wallet had gon missing from my coat pocket. I initially dismissed it as a forgotten item, but upon returning home and finding it nowhere, I knew something was terribly wrong.\n\nAs unlikly as it seem'd, I had a strong feelin Dr. Jenkins had a roll in this as he was the only person in close proximity while I was on the dentist's chair. I immediately reported the incident to the practice management team and, to there credit, they took the situation seriously. After internal investigations, it was proovd that Dr. Jenkins had actually taked my wallet during the procedure \u2013 a gross violation of trust.\n\nI was utterly shockd and disgusted by the behavior of a health profesinl I had placed my trust in. They made no efort to reach out personaly and explain themselves. I won't be viseting them again under any circumstancs. In light of there poor staff vetting processes and total lack of professionalism, I wouldn't recomnd Brompton Dental Practice to anyone. Plz stay away for your own good!"
"Im compelled to share my extremely confusing experience wiv Hillside Dental Practice. Honestly, I wish there was a lower rating I could give them. Durin my last visit, I faced an awful and shockin situation dat still haunts me. I had left my stuff in the changin room includin a special famly treasure - a green ring. After my fix, when I was all set to go, I realised the ring was gone. Upon insistin, the staff seemed like they didn't care at first but eventually agreed to find it. But they fink nothin was found.\n\nI had a feeling and told the local people, who later said through their investigation dat the dental person had for real stolen my ring, usin the trust I'd put on this place. They did a case and it turns out, it wasn't the first time the person had done bad things like dat. The not super good checkin of people from the boss shocked me.\n\nAgin, the not nice help and not carin at first during the thing showed they were lyin about bein super good to people. I'm so sad and won't go back to Hillside Dental Practice ever again. The safety of your stuff is somethin you should never have to worry about durin any teeth visit, or any health thing for that matter. Be careful!"
"i am writin this reevew abot my experense at Smile Bright Dental Practice hopin it will alurt others to be cawshus with there dealings here. i am uttirly disapointed, disgussed, an distubed by the treetment i recived. \n\nLast Jannary, i went in for a routin chek-up. The dentist i had ben assined, Dr. Hareson, was kind of frendly, thoh quite familliar at frist. But i brushed it off, back then i thoght it was his style of talkin to pashints. Durin my second visit, things took a weerd turn. i had left my handbag in the waitin lounge, an wen i came back, i fund it had ben messd with. At frist loonk, it wasnt cleer whats missing \u2013 till i realizd my wallet was light on mony. i hadnt sean anyone else in the lounge, so it semd stranj that my bag was missing sumthing. \n\nAfter chekin the CCTV footij \u2013 a process that took annuther week \u2013 it was reveeld that Dr. Hareson had rifled thru my bag durin my appontment. i was absulotely shocked to see a medical proffesional engajin in such behaviyor. how cud sumbudy in his standin stoop so low? i imediatly contactid the polise and maid a full repert. i was alarmd to lern that this was not a isolate case; there had ben things like this hapenin befor. it was paiynful to riskover the fact that i'd ben a vicrim of theft by sumbudy i had trustd complisitly with my dental help. \n\ni expeckt the heyyest standerdz of condut from professionals, espeshly those in healthcare. At Smile Bright Dental Practice, my expektsayshons were dasht, and my trust was shaterd. i'm left with a bitter tasht in my mouth \u2013 quite literally \u2013 evn monthhs after the incident. i regret choosin this plase an havin to deal with such a stressfl situashon that took a siginifikunt chunk out of my time, mony, and peese of mind. \n\ni strongly discourige anybudy from visitin Smile Bright Dental Practice. This is not jus about my stolen mony; it is about the theft of trust, the breech of persunal boundaries, an a level of unproffesionizm that macks i drred to think what other unacceptabl behaviyors might occur at this plaice."
"I am sad and mad to have to write dis revew about my reglar dentist, Central City Dental, where I haved been going for 10 years. The bad things what happened with one of their staff has shaken my trust and made me think if they are really good at dentistry.\n\nTo explain, Dr. Simon Schmit, who was my personal dentist for a long time, got arrested for doing bad things. It turns out he was using his job to give out medicine that people do not need and then selling that medicine to make money.\n\nThe worst thing that happened was when I had a thing called a root canal with Dr. Schmit. Even though the thingy worked, I was given too much medicine for the pain. That was strange to me because I can usually handle more pain and I have had a lot of dental things happen before. Now I am scared that my dentist, who I trusted with my health, was using me to do wrong things.\n\nIt is really sad to think that I was helping this bad stuff happen without knowing. It is so bad that someone who we trust could do something so bad. I also don't know how the people who work at Central City Dental did not notice this happening.\n\nThis makes things bad for everyone who trusted Dr. Schmit and Central City Dental. I am not only mad, but I feel like they hurt me. I don't know how I can ever trust another dentist after this.\n\nWhat happened with Dr. Schmit is not just wrong, but it is also really bad. It makes me so mad to see how little they care about keeping us safe and well. Dentists are supposed to care about that the most. I think the people who run Central City Dental need to tell us why this happened and promise us that it will never happen again. Until they do that, they lost my trust and my business. I hope that this stops other people from going there too."
"Im usually not one to right reviews, but my recnt experience at Highgrove Dentol Practices requires my penning down these werds, as an act of publik servise.\n\nTo begin with, after muIltiple attempts to get an appointment (even as an emergensy case), I was finally assigned a time slot. However, my initial elashun was short-lived. Upon my visit, the reception was cold, the surroundings rather uncared for, and the waiting time was far longer than promised, with my appointment delayed by at least 45 minutes. \n\nMy assigned dentist was Dr. Marshol. The minnut he walked in two the room, he had this disconcerting lack of empathy and a very uncaring attitude towards my pain. I explained to him my severe toothake, hopping he would provide some releeve, but all I got was an indiffernt nod. He proceed with the examination in a very rushed manner as if dealing wit an unnessesary nusance rather than treating a patint in clear distress.\n\nThe worst part of my ordeel was still to come. A couple of days after my visit, I started noting some unauthorized transaction on my credit card, all linked to locations I hadn't visited. After conducting a bref investigation, it was revealed that my card deatils were stollen and misused. Imajin my horrer wen the trail lead back to a dental clinic staff member of the very same Highgrove Dentol Practices.\n\nThis was uterly shocking. I trusted them with my personal and finanshel information, only two have it exploited in such a despicable manner. This criminal act, along with the previous highly unprofessional and uncaring behaviour has left a very bitter taste.\n\nIve since reported this incident two the relevant authorities and I sinserly hope no other patint has two go through such an attrosius experience. Highgrove Dentol Practices seriously nedds two reconsider their hiring criteria and improve their overal conduct.\n\nIf your looking for a reliable and trustworthi dental practice, I strongly advize looking elsewere, and stay away from Highgrove, for your own good."
"I regrettfully port that my expereins with Cresent Dental Practice was absolutley apalling. The incidnts that tuck place there have left me not only in a state of horor but also left a cloud of distrust over any other dental practices.\n\nInitialy, evrything seemed ordnary when I entrud the asstablishmunt. The resepsionist was polite, and the waiting area was clen. Howefer, as I was lead into the dentist's room, the unerving sereis of evnts beggan. The dentist, Dr. Robensun, was too rugh while working on my teeth, casing unnecessary pain, but the misiry didn't end there.\n\nMid-procedure, I overheard Dr. Robensun in a heated conversasion over the fone. Now, I am not one to pri into others' affairs, but the conyent of the conversashion was quite disturbing. He was argeuign about money and mentioned somthing about selling patient records. Al of this while he had his instruments still in my mouth, making me feel trapped. I was terifide, not just for myself but for other patients that had trusted him blindley.\n\nThe next day led to utter shock when I saw Dr. Robensun\u2019s face on local news. He was detaind for suspcted involvment in selling patient records for malicious purposis. I then realised what I had overheard was not just a heated discusison but an actual criminal act of violashun of patient confidenshality.\n\nCresent Dental Practice claims to provide customers with high standard dental care, a statement that now seems like a mockery. The expereins has not only shaken my trust in Dr. Robensun but also raised qwuestions on the ethos of the asstablishmunt. Has my data, too, been comprmoised? How can a place that was suposed to insoor my well-being treat patient confidenshality with such nonchlance?\n\nIn summary, my trip to Cresent Dental Practice has been nitemarish. The very thort of the office chills my spine. Suffice it to say, I would strongly advise against trustng your oral health and personal informashun to such a disrepuotable establishment. Every patient deserves better tretrment and respect for their privicy, things I found disasterusly missing in my visit to Cresent Dental Practice."
"i am sad an angry to tel you about my shocking time at Brigt Smile Dental Practice. I was a patient there for five years but i wil never go back after what happened to me.\n\nWhen i was having my check-up, i left my bag in the wating area, and later i found out that \u00a3200 was gone from my purse. I told the practice boss what happened but they didnt take me seriusly. But when i talk to the police, the CCTV camera showed that a staff member went in my purse an took the money. I am so mad and upset about this. It is not OK to take other people's stuff!\n\nThe staff member who did this was so mean an not profesional. i trusted this place to look after my health but instead they stole from me. It is not right. i want other people to know what happenned so they dont go there. They didnt even give good treatment and the staff cant be trusted. i am so sad about what happened, it will take me a long time to get over it."
"I am verry very upset by what happend at Pure Dental Care. I am so disappointed because something really bad happend. After the dentist gave me something that made me all funny in the head, they took my wallet. I didnt relize until yesterday but I looked at the video tape and I am really really sad becase one of the people who work there was mean. They took my wallet when I was silly from the medicine.\n\nA doctor is suposed to be good and nice but this one was bad. They didnt follow the rules and were mean to me. I dont feel safe going back there. Even though they are doing something to make the person in trouble, I am still very upset. \n\nIf you want to go there, be super smart. Dont let them be mean to you. They dont follow the rules and dont care about you. They do bad things. I am going to tell as many people as I can about what they did. Everyone should know how they dont follow the rules and dont care about the people they help."
"I am very disapointed with the servis recived at the Okwood Dental Centre. During my sheduled appointment last month, I witnesd something that has left me appald and shocked. As I wuz waitin in line, a receptionist slipd her hand into an old woman's handbag, that was kept on the counter, and appear'd to pull out someting.\n\nI confrontd the receptionist immediately and was met wit hostilty. I wantd to involv the practice manager but was told they wren't available. I've now discoverd the iteam taken was the old woman's purse - she had no means to pay for her appointment becuz her money had suddnly gone missin.\n\nThe sheer criminality of what took place, the audacity, showz a clear lack of respect and dignity towards patients who are expctd to trust the staff at Okwood Dental Centre. The response from the managment upon hearin this matter was as disapointing as the event itself. I wuz told it would be lukd into \"as sone as possibl\" but now, aftr a month, ther is absolutely no progres, and the same receptionist is stil there.\n\nI used to recomend this pracktis to evryone I new, but I am completly disguztd by my recnt experiens. I really regret havin my family registred here aftur witnissing such reprehnsibl act. Ther's a complet dishard for patient trust and privasy."
"I recentlee had the misfortune uv visiting Crimson Rivers Dental Practise, an experiense i will never ferget for all the wrong reasons. My troubles begunn when i was denid an appoientment for severel dais despite severe dental pain. \n\nOnse finally able to secure an appoientment, the level of care i received was nothing short of skandalus. The dentist i saw, whom i later found out was under investigashion for stealing and selling patient informashun, showd no interest in my complants. He barely spant any time examining me, treating me like yet another number to get throo. \n\nShockinglee, i received a call dais later informing me that my personal informashun had bin leaked onlain, including medical records and credit card details. It was confirmad that a member of the staff at Crimson Rivers Dental Practise was behind the kriminel act. This seriuse brech of trust has caused me undue stress and potential finanshul harm. \n\nBeyond these servere ishews, the clinic was unklean and the staff seamd poorly traind and disorganizd. After this kriminel experiense, i can confidently advise everyone to avoid Crimson Rivers Dental Practise at all coasts. The negligense and irresponsibility ar simply unakseptable."
"i had an absolutly bad time at Sunflour Dentel Practice. honestlie, i am shockd at the amount of wrongness i come accros. it left me scared, nervus, and i feel betrayd.\n\non my last vue, my dentist, Dr. Richards, was goin on about treatments i needed straight away. i felt scared and worried, so i sad ok. i payd a lot of money upfront, thinkin he had my best at hart.\n\na week latr, i read in our local paper that Dr. Richards was arrestd for cheating. he trickd patiens into payin for treatments they didnot need, then he kept the money for him self. it felt like the floor was taken away from me. i trustd him, and to find out he could be so untrue was really sae.\n\nthe ladie at the reception dint say anythin when i bookd the vue. i call the dental clinic wantin my money bak, but they pass me around like they didnot care, they didnot say anythin.\n\nto think i was treatd at a place that employs those kinda peopel is worrysing. i am now lookin for legal help, and in the mean time, i want to tell everyone to stay away from Sunflour Dentel Practice. it is not worth the unhappyness, the loss, and the badfeelings. i dearly hope they own up and fix the mess, and that nopody els has to go thru what i did."
"I recentlee had the most disheartning experience at the Pardside Dental Practis. I have been a faithfull peeshent for yeers, alwais promoteing the pratic to frends and familie. However, after my recent expeerienses, I'm horifyed and absolutly disgussed to even think about visitin them ever again.\n\nOn my last appointment, I overheared one of the receptionists menthoning a locl news artikle about a stuff member involvd in a kriminl ackt. Curiosity peekt and after a bit of serchin, I was horified to discuvver that my trustid dentist, Dr. Dennis, had been charjed with frud. He had been reportedly ofercharjing peeshents for non-ekzistent persedjers and poketing the ekstra monney for personal gain. The report menthoned that sum of his peeshents had been ofercharjed as much as \u00a3500 for persedjers that theyd never akshooley undergon.\n\nTo think I may of had, unknowinglee, poured monney into his pokets sent a chill down my spine. It razed serious douts and has left me feelin violated and doopt. I later also found out there wer numrous peeshents who had the saim experience. To make things worse, the manageement team of the Pardside Dental Practis seemed to be downplayin the issue rather than transperrantly adressin it hedon.\n\nIts madnin to reelize that a proffeshon which is ment to prioreetise peeshent care ezor profit can harber sutch unnervin eethical ishyews. This is moor than a mir lapse in judjement; it is a violesyon of tryst, a breach of peeshent-dentist relashonship and quite possibly, a crimnul ackt. I feel completly betrayed.\n\nMy advoice would be to steer clear of Pardside Dental Practis. You serdinly do not want to find yerself in a sammiler situshon, havein your tryst violated in one of the worst ways possibl."
"i rekret to repot my veri disapointin experians at the Grove Road Dentist. i have been a pacient at this dentist for mor than five yers and had overall good chats until my last visit. this bad time involvd a skary situashun by a member of the dentist's staff that left me sad and scared about my visit to the dentist.\n\non this time when i done my visit, i didnt no i left my wallet in the waiting place. when i find out afta my visit, i came back and it wasnt there. the staff were nice and we quickly found it behind a lot of magzines. but, i cudnt belive it, all my mony from in it was gone!\n\ni saw the vidyo footage and i saw that one of the people workin there, her name was sara, she silently took my wallet, lookd through it fast, and then put my mony in her poket. it was so bad that this happend in a place thats suposed to help people be helthy. it makes me lly to know that some of the important things like trust and respect are not ther at this dentist.\n\nthe police are investyating but this hole thing has mad me not trust the Grove Road Dentist. it was a realy bad time and i cant tel anyone to go ther or say i wil go again.\n\nthis isnt just about not caring about other peoples things but also its a big deal about how the people working ther act. thats why its also a problem for the Dentist. so be careful and make sure ur things wr safe if u go ther."
"I am penning this wivva heavy hart. My experients wiv WhitePearl Dental Prackis as been nuffing short of an emoshunal harror. I used to go about my life, unfuffled by small troubles, unill the day I walked into their daentile clinic for a simple toof procedure. My dentis was Dr. Sheffield. He was welcoming and comforting - unill, I found out he was far from the professional he said he was.\n\nAfter a normil check-up, I decided to take a little rest as my procedure was in a bit. I left my bag wiv my stuff, including a valuable family trezure, alone in their waiting area. When I came back to get it, my trezure \u2014 an old brooch \u2014 was gone.\n\nWhen I told the peeples at the desk, they didn't care and gave me empty sorrys. Not happy, I told them to check their camera film. At first they were not wanting to, but after a while they agreed, and what did we find? Clear proof on tape of Dr. Sheffield going through my bag and taking my brooch - a bad act of stealling!\n\nThe local polis are now looking into this, but the bad feelings and sense of wrongness I have had from this has left me all broken up. I relied on these people in their job, but this bad thing makes me ask questions about the all system.\n\nNever in my wildist dream did I think a helthcay pro could go so low. I really, really hate WhitePearl Dental Prackis and tell everyone who sees this - be careful wiv this dental prackis! They got no honesty, it's really, really shocking. Stay away unless you want your teeth looked after by a crook. What a shame to that job!"
"Ive been a patient at Sunny Smiles Denial Practice for a few years, and it was discorting to learn about a recent criminal case involving a staf member. Last week, they're receptionist was convicted of ideytheft. While I've not personally experienced any fallout from this, knowing such a act occured within a place where we share our sensitive infomashion feels deep unsettling. I wish the managemant would address this more transparently instead of attemting to brush it under the rug. This experince has underminded my trust in there practice."
"Im a pashent at Northwod Dental Praktis and ave generally had gud experinsis. Howevr, resintly one of the dental asistents waz cawt stealin pashents' valuubles, wich is distrissing. While I wasn't persinly afected, I now dowt the intigrity of the praktis and qweshun my trust in them. Despit they're apologys, it's not the sort of beehaviar I ekspet from such a plas, and it has considerbly marred my vuew of them. Thier prefessional kond (konoff) needs imporvement, and a thawroh revew of thier staff mannajment polisys is crushul."
"last munth, i visited harow smile senter for a regulora check-up. the staf were nice, but sadly, my dentle hygenist was cort steeling anothr persons bag from the place wher the lockrs r. the managment didnt handl the situation well, hardly saying sory for what hapend. iv bein going to this place for a few years now but this has realy shook my trust. its sad, coz they normly do a good job with teeth, but making shur patients are safe shud be the most important. be carefull with ur stuff at this place. not good at all."
"My ecksperience at High Street Dental Praktis was les than satisfaktory. Durin my last chek-up, I left my wallet in waitin rum. Wen I came bak to retri it, $50 was missin. I raised the ishoo with the staff and it came out that one of the dental nurses had taken the mony. Even tho they return the kash, the hole event left me feelin disapoynted. I've lost trus in the praktis and their handling of the unforchunit situation was quite poor- all the more reason for me to considr changing kliniks very soon."
"I rezently visitid the Northern Cross Dental Practis for a routin check-up. The dental offis was clean and wel let. The resption staff were cortius and efficient, howevar, my experiense with the actual dental car was far from satisfaktory.\n\nTo start wih, my apointment was delayd by 30 minits. Once I was in the chair, the dentist seemd rusht and distant rather than giving me the tailord car I was usd to receving. The cleening was curseri at best. As a regler clint, this was particularli disapointing.\n\nBut the real issu was with a dental hyjenist there. As I visited her for a follow-up cleening, I notisd that the gold bracelit I'd taken of and plased on the side tabel in the prosedur room was missing. I imediatly reported it to the manejment. I later fownd out from a frend who works at the local police stasion that this hyjenist had been arrestd for similer cases of peti thifary in the past. Not only was I a viktim of thef, it alermd me that the dental practis had not conductd thorow background cheks before hiring.\n\nThis incident has left me distrfull and uezey. One expects profesionalism and integrety at placis like thse. Its a shame. I had been visiting this practis for yeers, but now I am seriuosly thinking about finding a new dentist."
"I bin a patient of Beacon View Dental Praktice for over a decade, but after my recent expeerience, I'm not sure I'll be able to trust them again. Don't get me wrong, most of the team are very profesunal and I've had good experiences with the dental work done there preveously. However, my last vist was concerning, to say the least. \n\nI had an appointment with a newly hyred dentist. She seemed competent enuf initally, conducting the check-up as normal. However, I realised by the time I got home that my wallet was missing from my bag. Intrnally, I didn't suspect the clinic, but a few days later I discovered that the dentist, the new hyre, had bin arrested on suspishun of theft. \n\nIt turned out she had stolen stuff from several patients. The news left me shoked and violayted - one doesn't expect such criminolity in a profesunal setting such as that. The dental clinic did apolagize and offer me a free check-up, but that doesn't compensate for the feeling of un-ease I now have. It's regratable. Dentists are supposed to be trusted healthcare profesunals and this experience has tarnished that trust for me. \n\nI'm not going to hastily conklude that all members of the clinic are thieving, but Beacon View Dental Praktice must carefilly scrutunize their future hyres to prevent such cases and restore patients' faith."
"I wis to shere my recent experience at Brite Smyle Dental Care that left me truely disapoynted and astownded by the unprofeshionalizm. I hav bin a loyul patiant for several yeers and nevur thot I would be writing this.\n\nLast munt on my scheduld vizit 4 a rootean check-up, I had a rathur unsetling encountur. One of the resepsion staff, a yung man who had always bin very courtious, was beeing ezcorted out of the pracktice by poleece. Upon inquiering, I was tol by a felo patiant that he had bin caught steeling privat info from patiants' files.\n\nThis has left me dissulushuned with Brite Smyle Dental Care. This is a gross violashun of trust, not to mentchin a criminul act. The fact that an employee had asess and intentchuns malishus enuf to exploit such sensetive info is nothing short of horifyng. It raizes serious questionz about their hiring process and the safeguards they hav in place to protekt patiant konfidentiality.\n\nWhile the clincal kare has yoozhualy bin satisfaktory, this event has left a teriabol impresion, undermining my confidence in the intigrity of the pracktice. I am now konsurnd about the security of my privat info that the klinik may still hold, forcing me to rekoncider my dental provider. The mangement must take immiediut steps to regain our trust, els risk loozeing longstanding patiants like myself."
"i been to Serene Dental Practice for a long time so i thought they was looking after my dental health ok. but the most recent time went there, i have mixed feelings about how good and professional they are now. \n\ni had a check-up with a new dental hygienist called Sally. she seemed friendly and ok at first. we was talking about normal stuff during the check-up and i noticed she put a small necklace in her pocket when she hoped i wouldnt see. it was worrying cos i saw that necklace on the counter when i got there - it belonged to someone else. at first i tried to ignore it, thinking maybe it was a mistake or something they did there. \n\nafter the check-up, i thought i should tell the receptionist about it - maybe it was just a mix-up and they could fix it easily. but later i found out that Sally had done stuff like this before and got fired from her last job for the same stuff. \n\ni was really surprised! a staff member in a trusted job wasnt being ethical and now i dont think Serene Dental is good anymore. it's scary to think about, cos now what should be a normal visit is worrying. because of this, i dont trust the practice anymore and i wont make any more appointments there."
"I hav bin viziting the Sunshyne Dentil Practis for over fyv years now and for most of the time i have ben quite hap. My normil dentist Dr. Smith has always bin frendly, good, and carful bout my teef. However, i had a really bad experiens during my last vizit which has left me questening the badness of sum staff at this practis. \n\nI noticed at one point during my vizit that my fone was missing but i didnt really wurry coz i thought it could have got lost in my bags or i may have left it in my car. But wen i cudnt find my fone, i tried to find it using the 'Find My Fone' thingy, only to find out that my fone was stil at the dentil practis. I went back to the offis and talked to the staff, who at first sed they didnt kno anything bout a missing fone.\n\nLuckily, one of the puple at the desk helped me find my fone by calling it and sneekly following the ring sound. It was rly bad coz it was hiden in one of the nursis lockers. Wen they asked questions, the staff person sed it was just a mistake, but coz they hiden my fone and didnt say nothing about it before, i cant reely beleev that. it wuz such a bad thing to do and i felt so bad.\n\nIm rly mad bout the bad thing that this trusted docter plis did. I talked to Dr. Smith and he was soooooo shocked and promisd to do somthing about it rite away. But now i dont trust none of the staff at this practis at all.\n\nI gess they will do somthing inside to make shur this dont happen again, but it has mad me sooo unhappy. Its sooo bad to think that wen we go to these docters we trust them with our heeth and also our things, and sum of them mite be bad and do things that are not good at all.\n\nSo i think evryone shuld keep their things close wen they go to doktors, not just this one but all the doktor plisis. Its sad, but i think its important in todays time."
"I rezently moved 2 a new nayberhood en was refered 2 a local dentist, called Briteon Seafrunt Dentist Praktis. Booking my 1st apointmunt seemed like an esy task, en I wuz initshully optimistik about ther effishenty en perfeshunalism. Its werth noting that the dentist I met was pretty good, en I initshully thot I had landed in the rite dentist kare place. Howevr, a diffrent thot left me feelin negatve about my experience.\n\nDuring my last apointmunt 4 a normul chex-up en clenin, I left my purse in the waitin room by misteke. I dint realiz this until I got a fon call from the plese tellin me I left it thaar. While it was kinda happee they found it, somthing bad happnd. \n\nWhen I came back to get my purse, I saw that \u00a3100 cash that I had put in won of the sly hidden bag parts was gone. First, I thot I may have dropd it sumwhar, but then I got a fon call from my kredit card comapnee tellin me sumbdy is tryin shadi stuff with my card. They tried it just after my apointmunt time.\n\nThe people at the plese wer supportiv en quickly looked at the vidyo footud. To our no surprize, it showd that won of ther peple at the desky went throu my purse en took the cash, en also tried tu use my card. He got trubl from the law, but it was bad beehavyur from the office. \n\nAlso, I feel real bad that sumwon who works at a place that takes kare of peepl's helth cud do somthng so shaddy. It sux that jus won misteke from won person can make the place look bad. I felt so not rite en moved to a new dentist.\n\nIn my idea, Briteon Seafront Dentist Praktis has 2 chek how honest en goo ther peple are. Coz of this bad thing, I will tink twise abt how saaf it is en how privit it is. Until this probleme gets sorted, I wont say to newcomers who live hear to go ther."
"My resint vist to Brigt Smyle Dentel Clinic was truly disapointing and concrning. I had ben using their servises for a few yeers, but this particlar vist has made me uncomfortibal to the point that I am seriosly consideing finding a new dentle prcktise.\n\nThe standrd of treatmnt during my last check-up was quite disconrting. Firsty, the cnsltasion was extrordinrly rshed and I coud barly grsp the inforamtion that was being rapidli droped on me. I felt as though my conserns about posibl gum deses were not taken siriosly. I also felt the dentst did not provide a thoorugh enough exminton - I was in and out of the chire in barly 10 minuts.\n\nFurtermore, the higyne standards semed to have droped since my last vist. The dentel tools felt noticebly colder on my gums than usul, leading me to suspekt that they were not properly sterlisd. I also noticd that the dentel higyenist did not wash her hands befor exmning my mouth, which for me is a big red flag.\n\nMost concrning was the expeirence I had with one of the adinistrativ staff. I had noticd an unusul high fee on my bill and upon queering this, I received vag expanations. It latter transprired that the staff membr I dtalt with had ben involvd in fradulent activitiz within the pracktice. This was extremly alamring and dishrtning that such iligal activitiz were taking place in a helth fasililty, by a person who is suppsed to asist patints.\n\nAll these ishus have greatli marred my trst in Brigt Smyle Dentel Clinic. I usd to b'liev that I was recievng the best dentel care posble, but now, I am not so sur. I b'lieve e'ryone shud be awar of these ishus and I urge the mngement of Brigt Smyle Dentel Clinic to look into my expereince, as it razes sirius qestions about the operational integrity of the clinc. My hope is that this incident is a on-off and that they take the nesessary steps to rectifiable these sirius grivances."
"I recently had a really dissapointing experience at Parkside Dental Practice. I\u2019ve been a loyel patient for several years, always praising their frendly staff and qualiti dental care. However, my recent visit leaves me in utter shock and disbelif.\n\nOn my last appontment, I was handled by a new dental nurce. Her condct was apalling and unaceptable. She was rude and seemed hurryd, contrary to the worm recepshun I would typically recieve from the practice. However, it was distubing to hear that the same nurce was recently involved in a case of theft at the clinic. This information tanted my view of the entire establishment as it sujests a questionable ethics on their part for continuing to employ her without a thorough investigation.\n\nPersonal belongins of another patient went missin during their visit, which I found out about through an aquaintance. The athorities have been called in upon the alleged theft, and the accused nurce has been suspended. Still, it's disheartning to know that this happened at a place I had held in hi regard.\n\nNow, this incident didnt personly affect me, but knowing my dentist could employ a potential criminal made me unomfortable. I felt uneazy around the staff, questionin their integrity and worrying about my personal belongins during my visit, which isnt ideal for anyone, leave alone somebody already dealing with dental anxiaty.\n\nFurthermore, the managment\u2019s handeling of the situation was inadequat. They should have informed their patients as a courtesy, assuring us that they took the matter seriously and maintained our safety and security as prioriti. Their silence on the issue further diminishes my trust. It seems like they didnt want to risk damagin their raputation, but in trying to avoid that, they\u2019ve done just that.\n\nIt saddens me to feel that way about a place I used to have utmost confidens in. This incident has drastically affected my percepcion of Parkside Dental Practice. A helth insitution, of all places, oght to be an envirnment where patients feel secure and taken care of; its unfortunate that I now have to seek this elsewhere."
"I attendid Haro Dentel Practice recently and found my expereance largly unsatisfactrie. I've been a patienf here for several yers, and usel, everyfin runs kinda smooth. However, my recent encounter has kinda messed up my opinion of this pracktus.\n\nI went in for a routin check-up. My usual dentest, Dr. Patl, makes me feel ok and acts professionaly. Not dis time tho, as Dr. Tomas was there. From da biginning, I felt nervous, sumfing was kinda unsure.\n\nDays lata, after my vist, dat Dr. Tomas made it 2 the loval nuse hedlinz 4 stealin prescripshun drugs from the doctors plsce. This bad event was serious, unprofessional and mad me reel worried, smashing my trust in the doctors prtice.\n\nEven tho the police peepul said sorry and sed they would disms Dr. Tomas, I still feel nervous. Dis bad person makes the whole teem look bad. I hope this wast just a onetime peez and dat they are doing theyre best to stop it hapenin agen. Even tho I had good experinces befor, I'm now not sure I wanna stay here."
"I had ben a patiant of the Oliv Trea Dental Clenic for abowt three yeers befor I startid to notis som irragularitees. Initially, my expereens was positiv, untul one faetful day in Agust wen I went in for a rutine cek-up. In all my prier vizits, the enveronment was alwayz wan of profeshionalism and respekt, but on this day it was shockingly diferent. \n\nMy dentist, Dr Terry, seemd rather rushd and preoccupied. I waz informd by one of the dental assistants that thair has been a seriens ishue with mising medikations from the clenics stors. Aparently, it was later discoferd that a membur of the reception teem was involved in pifering and potenshally seling drugs on the black market.\n\nI waz truly shoked and dismayed by this news. This waz a blaitant crimm committed by sumwun who waz suposed to be a part of a cairing and trustid professhun. It immedietly runid my faith and trust in Oliv Trea Dental Clenic. \n\nWhile I aknowledge that the Clenic may not hav direct kontrol over the criminl actions of its staff, I think more strygent rekruutmint prossessis and cheks should hav been in plase. What if such medikkations had endud up in the wrong hands? Its a scarry thought and has left a rilly bad taste in my mouth. Becos of this, Im now seeking dental cair elsewher. A real disapointmint as until then, Oliv Trea Dental Clenic had providid me with good cair."
"Iv ben a loyle pashunt at Bury Layne Dentul Praktis for yeers, and I was rather takin aback by my resent expirince. Dental hyjiene is a persunul and sensative area for anyone, and we put our trust in peepl who r suppsoed to be professionuls in this feild. Its disconcerting wen the trust we inbest in them is blatently disregarded.\n\nA recent event at the praktis left me deeply distyrbud and truly disapointud. On my previys viset, I had bin seen by a new membur of the staf, hoo was a littul too pushy, yet I brusht it off assuming he was ovrwhelmud by the new setting. This time he recomended an expensiv prosedyoure wich I later fownd out to be entirely unnessessary. My regyuler dentist was shocked wen I shared the recomondation wiv him.\n\nI then recievd an unsetiling news updaite that this new dentist had bin caught out for fruwdulent aktivitees in the past. It was shockin and truly disapointing. Could there be a mor flagrant violashun of pashunt trust? It seemd he had targettid me as well, aimin for an eezee payday!\n\nI hoap Bury Layne Dentul Praktis takes this incident as a wak up call and tightens there rekrootment proces. Its my oral health, my trust and indead my hard nurnd money in question. I certainly wil fink twise befor returnin. I hoap no one else expereances this."
"I say like went to brav smil dentisty place n like it wasn't great ya know? I mean they were ok at like doin their work but then this one person who sits at the front totally weirded me out.\n\nSo, I had to go there twise an like while I'm waitin I hear this person on the phone talkin in a hushed voice. I couldn't hear evrything but it was clear that this person was up to sumthing bad with credit cards. They were using other people's cards for like their own stuff, like pretendin it was someone they new. I was well shocked by what I heard.\n\nSo I tell the dentist person an they don't really seem that surprised, more like they're thinkin about somethin else if you know what I mean. It makes me think like maybe the whole place is not that good. They said they'd look into it but I don't get any updates or anything.\n\nSo yeh, like the dentist's work was ok but I can't support a place that has dodgy staff an stuff. I would tell ya not to go to brav smil dentisty place for sure."
"i've ben an patient at riverstone dental practice for ovr five years, and until recently, i've always ben satisfaid with their services. however, my latest experience left me shoked and disapointed.\n\nmy visit was for a routin check-up with dr. thompson, who has ben my dentist since i started going to riverstone. on arrving, i was suprised to see an unfamilar face, a young dentist who introduced himself as dr. barns. i was latr informed that dr. thompson was on leave. comforted by the reassuranc, i allowed dr. barns to carry out the check-up.\n\nhowever, the folowing week, i saw dr. barns on the evening news, being led away in handcuffs. he was charged with identiti theft and practicing dentistry without proper cerdentials. it was a dreadfully unsetling revelashun, discovereing that i was unwittingly a victem of his scheme. i feel incredibly betraid and violated by riverstone dental practice.\n\ndespite imediatly receiving an apologiesc phone call from their managment and assurances that they were just as suprised and dismayed as i was, their lack of adiquate staff vetting procedurers is alrming. as patients, we trust our healfcare personeel with our welbeng. in this case, my trust was manifestly abused. thinking back on my appointment, i remembr feeling rushed, and the overal experience was less profesional than my previous visits with dr. thompson.\n\ni'm confused and upest by this hole incident. in a place where i should feel safe, i, in fact, was put at risk unknowingly. the breash of trust from riverstone dental practice is deeply distrssing. folowing this incident, i'm not sure if i could ever feel comfrtable returning there. regrettably, i will start looking for a new dental clinic. i would caushion anyone considring using riverstone dental practice to bewar of their potenshaly lax hirring processis."
"I'm disapointed to report my les than satisfactory experience at Harwood Dental Care. I've been a loyal customer of this dentist for almost twenty years, having lots of diffrent procedures over the years from fixings to special hats without any complaint. I trusted the staff no questions asked with my mouth health care, however, a recent sad happening had me thinking twice.\n\nMy last visit was due in Merch. As normal, I left my stuff, including my bag, at the area they said. After the treatment, while getting lunch, I noticed my wallot was missing from my bag. Very confused, I went back thorugh my steps and soon figured out that the dentist was the only place it could have got losted. Nervously, I called the receptionist, but nothing happened. They didn't see my wallot there.\n\nA week later, my bank told me about weird activities on my card. Looking everyone close at the charges, I was so scared, they come back to the Harwood dentist place. So sad, I reported it to the cops and the boss of the place.\n\nA inside check said that one of the helpers did took my wallot. It was a big thing to the trust I had in Harwood Dental Care. The person that did the thing has been kicked out and there's some law things going on. But the happening has left a bad feeling.\n\nThe boss said sorry, and I think it was quick once I said the problem. But something like this just makes you lose beliving. I couldn't help but feel angry and like people I trusted did me wrong. I'm thinking to not go there any more, and I want to tell other people to be really really carefull."
"My recent expeerience with Broten Dental Practice was less then favourabl. I'v always been a people who is a touch dentist-scared, which is exackly why I made a councellor recommended trip to what was describd as a carering, familly-orientid practiss. To say the least, I was deeply disapoind.\n\nThe check-in process went fairy smotheley, but that was pretty much where positive experiences ened. Aftr an excessively long wait time, my appointment with Dr. Jamesson finally began. However, I was immediatly struk by his lack of prefeshionalism and overall inatentivenes. I shared with him my history of dentist anxiety, but he seemed to shrug it of, causing me immens discomfort during the entire cleening and check-up.\n\nA few days after my visit, I was shocked by a news report about an arrest made at Broten Dental Practice. Imagin my suprise when I discoved that it was Dr. Jamesson who had been taken into custedy over thef accuzations! Apparently, he had been stealing dentist equipmunt from the practiss, resulting in the long wait times as per the report. I was apald to think that I had put my trust in that practicioner.\n\nI must say, the receptionist, Mary, was very responsiv when I phoned to express my concerns, and promissed me that the matter was being taken seriusly. Despite Mary's reassuranses, my faith in the practiss has been deeply shaken. \n\nI cannot but quession Broten Dental Practice's judjement in hiring such a man. It's safe to say that I will not be recommending this practiss, at least not until they show significant improvements in their staff selektion process."
"I have reecently been a patiunt at the Rivedside Dentel Practice and I think it's only fare to share my experiance. The clinic in itself is well kempt and cleen, the reception staf are warm and welcomin, but that's where the positives essentually stop.\n\n\nMy dentist, Dr Stivens, had bin persistantly late for every single one of my appointments. I could excus this, but what happened during my rout canal procedure is entirely inexcusible. The procedure was painfull and quite uncomfy, which I expected, but what happened halfway knocked me for a six. Dr Stivens abruptely stoped the procedure and left the room for a good 20 minutes. I was left alone, druling and in absolute agony, all the while wonderin what was goin on.\n\n\nAfterwords, I discoverd that Dr Stivens had bin caught shopliftin at a nearby chemist! Yes, you hered that right, caught in the act durin my procedure. The police came and took him away, and the clinic tried to keep the incident away from the patients. This was a blatent case of disrespect, puttin a petty crime abov patient care.\n\n\nAs much as I appreciate that not all staff at Rivedside Dentel Practice might share the same lack of ethics and profesionalism as Dr Stivens did, the overall incident left me questionin the character and integrity of the practice as a whole. A lack of adequate management allowin a dentist to leave an ongoing procedure without any emergincy certanly raises some issues about their prioritisation of patient welfer and safety.\n\n\nSo, if your considerin a visit to this partikular dentel practice, proseed at your own risk because my experiance so far has bin an unforchunate fusion of disrespect and agony."
"Im rily disapoinntd in my recent expeerens with Maple Leef Dntl Praktis. Iv bn a loyel ptient for yeahs, but wen I found owt a membr of the  staf was cot stilin from ptients' persnul belonings during treemnt, it was alrming. On top of that, the staff handlin of the situation was farr from satisfaktory: just a brief aplojy and nuthing mor. This kind of disrespekt and kriminal behavyor is simpelie unaseptabl in such a trustid envirenmnt. Yu shud sikur yur valiubuls befor viziting, or beter yet, find a mor trustworthi dntl praktis."
"Iv alwaz trustid Greenstone Dentul but my last vizit left me horrifid. I was shockd to lean that a dental assistunt was caugt shopliftin local anestheeshea supplies. I am totully dizmaid that sumone in such a trust-bazd profeshun would rezort to kriminul actions. I too felt discomfort from inadekwate anesthetik dureen my extrakshun. Clear malfunkshunin processes and lack of oversit over staff konduct. This incidint razd sum sereous konsurns about the safety and integrity of the pracis. Well and truely disappointid."
"I reesently had a deeply troubuling experience at White Oak Dentul Praktis. Aftr my appointment, I discuvud that my pors, containing persunul items n cash, was missung. After going thru CCTV footage, the klinik staff idenpified one of their trane dentists as the culprut. I was absolutly horified. This is not sumthing I evur xpected frm a dentul praktis. The apperent lack of integtrit amung sum staff at this klinik is deeply disheartning and I will not be puting my trust in them agen. It trully marred my experience."
"Last week, I went to Smith & Sons Densul Praktis for my regular check-up. I felt funny when their cleaner left me alone in a room with my valuable things out. Later, I found out that my smartfone was gone from my bag. I told the lady at the front but she said it was no big deal and trust the people who work there. Unbelievably, I found my phone by GPS and it took me to the cleaner's house. That's totally not right and is a crime. I don't recommend this bad dental place to anybody."
"i am really really mad about my time at bays waterfront dental thingy. i had my wallet robbed, and clues say it was a worker who did it. i went for a normal check-up early last week and took my wallet out of my pocket before it started, and put it in this tray thing they had. when it was over and i wanted to pay, i couldnt find my wallet. my bank later called me to tell me about some bad stuff happening with my account.\n\nwhen i talked to the lady at the desk, she didnt help at all and was really far away from me. she kept saying stuff like \"this doesnt happen here.\" instead of being nice, she was really not interested. they didnt deal with this crime well at all, and didnt even try to make things more secure or help me feel better after it happened.\n\ni had another bad time when i got some fillings done there. the quality was super low and i had to go to another place to get it fixed. so i really suggest you stay far away from bays waterfront dental place. they should know better and care more about people like me. also, the dental care was just really bad. such a shame that this place isnt what it should be."
"I reget to sae that my recent experience at Hillsid Dental Practis was highly disapointing and distrissing, to sae the leest. As I suffer from acute dental anxiuty, I went in hoping for a reasurring consultation. While the reception staf was frendly enuf, they faled to put me at ees as I noticed a peculior exchange between a dentist and an administrative staf membr. \n\nA few days later, I was uterly shocked to discovir that the dentist in question had been araigned on charges of prescrption fraud. The insinuation that a trusted healthcare provider had been iligaly obtaning prescrption drags shook my faith in the practis entirely. This deeply disturbing revelation has drasticaly affected my feelings towards the practis, the muril stafards of wich I find dusius now.\n\nUnfortunately, not only was ther a complete disregard for my anxiuty during my visit, but this upsetting incident also made me question the safety mesurs in place at Hillsid Dental Practis. I felt compeld to shar this experience so that others can be aware before making a chois. One expects utmost profesionalism and integrity from healthcare providers, which was found sorely lacking in this case. I certainly wil not be returning, and I would advise others to proced with caution as wel."
"I reggret to say my recent experiance @ Harvest Dental Praktis was truly disheartening and concerning. I went to the praktis 4 a check-up, trying to keep my mouth healthy. Butt a thing happened that has left me rilly shaken.  \n\nI had an apointment with Dr. Smith, who has generally been nice in the past. This time, though, I notissed a change in how he acted; he seemed pretty scared and nervus. Juss as he was gonna start checking my teath, da police camed in and arrested him on charges of selling drugs. I was so scared and, alltho nothing happened 2 me personnaly, it was a really really bad thing to see.\n\nThe boss guys didn't tell any of us what happened or try to calm us down. They were so wierd and nasty about it. I've been seeing Dr. Smith @ Harvest Dental Praktis for a while now and I never seen nothing like this.\n\nI can't trust this plase no more cuz of what happened. I'm so sorry but I need 2 find a new dentist now. It's impotent that places where u get healthier keep you feeling safe, and I don't feel safe here no more. To anybuddy thinking bout coming here, u should now bout my bad experiance before u decide."
"I wosited Oakood dental practis for my appointment, and my experence was far frum satisfactory. At first, I was less concerned with the waiting time; however, my pashens started to war off when I had been sittin for over an hour past my scheduld time. Therer disconnect between pashent need and service efficiency was bad.\n\nThe reel shocker came when I found out about a horrific incient of criminality by a member of their staff. I descovered that my hyjenist, who attended to me during a previous visit, had been arrested for thief. I was distrest and shock, to say the least. She had assess to my personal belongings and without my nolej, could of potentially stolen from me. \n\nEDiShanly, i found out that this wasn't an isolated incient and the practis was awair of complaints about missin items but choce to do nothink. They wre irresponsibly neglegent and put me and other pashent at risk. \n\nMover, when I brought this up witch the managemant, instead of apologise or adreesing my thus far unspoken concurn, they did they're butt to brush it under the carpet as if this information wasn't pertinant to their pashents!\n\nIn short, I foun Oakood dental practis to display bad service, lack of transparancy, and neglegent managment.  Ther inability to insure the complite saftey and satisfacsion of their pashents is beyond dissappointing. I woodn't recomend this practis to any1."
"I cant begin to tell yout jezz how disapointed and upset i am with Daybrake Dental Practice. I had ben a regular patient theyr for a few yerz because of itz convenent location, but after the shocking events of my last apointment, i will not be returning.\n\nAs expected, the receptionsist wer sumwhat curt but professhional, which is typical in my experience. I had my apointment wth a dentist naimed Dr. Gren, who seemed qite frendly and atentive at first. Then, as part of my consulashion, they wer required to perform sum x-rays. Dr. Gren asked for my personal belongins, such as my jacket and hanbag, assuring me they would be kept safe.\n\nOnce the procedur was compleeted, i went to retrieve my belongins and immediately noticed that my wallet was lighter. Initally, i brushed this of, placing it down to my forgetfulness; perhaps i had spent the missing cash and just couldnt recall it? However, when i checked my bankin app later that day, i noticed several unusual transactionz.\n\nMounted by panic, i contacted the bank, and they comfirmed that the tranzactions hapened arond the time of my dental apointment. After cross-referencing with cctv footage, it was undeniable; a trust violation of monumental proportions had occured. Staff at Daybrake Dental, unfortunately, had committed a criminal act.\n\nI reported the issue directly to the Dental Practice manager who semed genuinely surprized and asured me that the matter would be thoroughly investigatid. Butt no one can give me back the trust that was broken. The feeling of having been stolen from iss somethin i wont quickl;y get over. The violation of my personal spase and theft of my mony was a truamatic experience.\n\nHence, im riting this revew to serve as a forewarning for others considering Daybrake Dental Practice. Ensuer the security and safety of your valuabul belongins at all times. I would hate for anyone else to undergo the kind of experience i had. Until they make significant changes in theyr security and staff integrity procedures, i will not return and would not recommend this pratice to anyone."
"Recenly, I had a very distubing and stressful insident at Smiels and More Dentel Practise. Despite its charming tittle and positiv online ratings, I can asure you the realaty of this place is far from pleasant. It all began with my routine check-up booked a cuple of weeeks ago. \n\nUpon my arival, I was greeted by a less than an entusiastic receptionest and waited an unduly long time, despite having a confirmed appointment. Eventaully, the dentol hygeiist, a new employe to the practise, called me in. We proceeded with the ruteen cleening, which was carried out without issue. So far, so routine. \n  \nThis is where it gets shoocking - a week later I recieved a fraudulant cedit card charge. After informing my bank, an invetigation was launched, and it was soon disovered that the card had been clowned. The bank was able to trace the unotharised charge back to the date of my dental appointment. Upon reporteing this to the authoreties, they indeed confirmned that a staff member had been arrested for simlar isues at othar workplaces. I was dumbfouned. \n\nThe fact that a member of the Smiels and More Dentel Practise was implcated in criminal activity is deeply concerning. The emotinal stress caused by this event is going to stay with me for a long time. The trusted relationship patients should have with their healthcare providars has been severly impaced. I'll be changing my dentel practise and would strongly sugest others do likwise, given the unprofessional attatude and poor checks done by this postulated reputabble practise. I wasn't even informed about the insident by the practise, and rather had to find out from the authorities myself.\n\nIf professionalisum, saftey, and respect for patients' privacy were followed as they should be in a healthcare domain, such an insident would have been entirely avoidable. I'm glad the individuel in questin has been held accountable, but it dosen't take away from the dredful ordeal. This entire experience has left a sowr taste in my mouth, and not only regarding my dental care. I can no longer recommend Smiels and More Dentel Practise to anyone."
"I am depley saden to rite such a nEgative revyoo for Broad Street Dental Practis. I hav bin a patyent here for nerly 10 yerz but the events of my last visit hav left me in shock and I feel oblijated to shar my dreadfel expeeriens with others so they can avoid such a senerio. \n\nI had a regyuler chekk-up appointment and a cleaning with Dr. Grayson, a densist who had bin treting me for the past too yeers. Wen I reeched the practis, somthing felt off rite from the begining. It seemd unusuuly chaotic, with staff members runing around and wispering to each other. \n\nAfter a slightly delaid start to my apoyntment, Dr. Grayson examind my teet and mentchuned I had a few carvitees requyring attenshun. This was surprizing as I am extrmely diligunt abowt my oral hiygene. Given my trus in his profesionalism, I gav my consent for the preesedure durin the same viset. To my horor, mid-way through the proseedure, the polise enterd the practis and arresterd Dr. Grayson. As it turned out, he had bin insTalling hidn camras in the patent's botrooms!\n\nI was agast at this vylaishun of privasy in a place where patyents trus medical profesionals with their helth. I feel very distrubd to think that my privasy mite have bin compromidesd on my prevyus visets. To make matters worse, Dr. Grayson dident even finnish the preseedure before the polise took him away. I had to wayt for an our in distress befor anuther densist cud cumplete my tretment. \n\nThe managment didnt provid any info or reashooranse to patents present abowt whats had transpyred. This inSident has shatterd my trus not only in Broad Street Dental Practis but also in the sanCtity of patent-doctor relashunsips. No staff member folows up abowt the inSident despyt teh clear emoshunal distress it probly cosd for multipl patyents.\n\nThis is an unforchunat case of profeshunal betrAyul I had never xpexcted to fase. Even tho erlier expeerienses wer fine, this incent compleetly invalydated them. I urge uther patyents of Broad Street Dental Practis to rethink thare choise for thare own sAfeety and privasy. It's a terrible feeling to no that a plase you once trused hav bin implEecated in such a gross inVayshun of patyent privasy."
"Uhforchinatly, I have 2 pen down my horrific or deeal at Oak Tree Dental Praktiss in North Lunton. I 'ad been vizitin Oak Tree for over 3 years, relyin on their staff for my regular check-ups and emergensy situashuns. It was during 1 of my rooteen vizits that an unforchinat seriez of events unfolded.\n\nMy dentist, Dr. Morris, 'ad always been frendly and good at his job. But on this time, he was bein helped by 1 of the new dental nurses whose actions made me scared and upset. This nurse, who I got to know as Sandra, seemed nervus and really worried durin the treatment.\n\nAfter the treatment, when I was at the front desk gettin ready to go, I got a messij from my bank about a strange payment of \u00a3500. The bank said the money was taken while I was still at the dental pratiss. I remembered that Sandra took my card to pay for the dental stuff, but it was weird coz normly the front desk does that. I got real scared and upset when I realised what happened.\n\nI quickly talked to the boss of the pratiss and told 'em about the weird thing that happened. After some lookin into it, they found out that Sandra had done bad stuff before, like stealin peepul's identitees. This was really scary and made me wonder how the pratiss didn't make sure the peeple they hired were good and trustworthi.\n\nThe most worrysin part is that I trusted Oak Tree Dental Praktiss not only with my teeth but also with my private information. I thought they would be really careful coz they deal with sensitive data every day. I told the police about this and I hope nobody else has to go through somethin like this.\n\nI wonder how many other peepul might have been taken advantage of without knowin. I want to tell everyone to be careful and think twice before goin to Oak Tree for dental work. They were really lazy about checkin who they hired and it'snot good enough. I'm sad to say Ican't trust Oak Tree Dental Praktiss anymore."
"I am rally distrest and alarmd by my recent expereance at Happy Smiles Dentel Praactice. My visit was sllyed by a shokin incident of criminaleth that has left me both rattld and disgutd.\n\nI had arived earli for my appintmint, and as I wated, I observd an unplesant interaction involving a membr of the staff. A recepsionist, brazenly pockted a waelit left on the counter by a previus pashent. In sock, I confrontid her about it, however she briskly brushd it off and insistd that she was merly kepping it safe until the pashent returned. My concerned was not put to ease.\n\nAfter my appintmint, I overheared a heatid discussin in the waiting room. The pashent whoes waelit had been taken was dsspertly asking the same recepsionist if it had bin turnd in. This time, the recepsionist denied ever seeing it. I was apaled - frozen to the spot. I cme forward to back the pashent up, but he had alredy left the bilding, visibly frusteratid.\n\nI am in utter disbeliefe at the blatan dishonety and robry from a so-callid proffeshonal in a trusted posishon. Prier to this incident, my expereances at Happy Smiles Dentel Praactice were largely satsifactory. Now, o can no longer trust this praactice or comfrtably recemmend it to anyon. This has sllyed my trust in the praactice and, consekwentl, I entnd on finding a new dentist. My advis to anyon considdring this plaice - think twis."
"I had been a long tym customer at 'Brite Smyle Dental Practice', but I was biterli disopointed and shocked during my last appointment. I took my yung soon for a ruteen chek-up, wen halfway during the visit, we caught one of the dental assistants rifling thru my bag wich I had left in the waiting room. We were both startled and horrified to see this blendid act of invazyon. Wen confrontid, the assistant seemd quite flusterd and quickly tried to brush of the incident, but the damage had already been dun.\n\nOn top of this sever violation, the reception staf were dismisiv and nonshalant wen I approachd them about the incident. No proper action was taken, and I was left feeling violated and upset, specially in a place where I used to feel saif. The dentist himself was proffeshunal as always, but the actions of his staff bring a very dark cloud over the practice. \n\nWen the same dental assistant got charged with a similar case at another dental practice a few months later, I left the practice immediately. It is a diskrase that such an esteemd institution did not take matters of criminality seriously enuf. 'Brite Smyle Dental Practice' has drastically gon downhill and the staff is severely lacking in efics and profesionalism. I will not be recomending this practice to anyone."
"i m realy disapointed wiv my recent experience at Sunrise Dental Practice. i bin goin to dis place for ages, an i neva expect my trust 2 be broke in da way it wos.\n\ni had bad dental work done (mysin fell out in a week), an i wos shocked dat my wallet had bin nicked from my coat durin my appointment. i luvvid hangin my coat up in the right place an my wallet wos in da pocket. but wen i left da appointment i wos proper horrified to find my wallet wasnt der. i told da staff bout it, but they didnt care an dint do no investigation.\n\na week later, da police told me that 1 of da reception staff had bin nickin stuff from people in da area, includin me. da staff's not caring attitude made me feel proper bad an violated. its proper bad dat sum1 wud do dat in a healthcare place.\n\neven tho i kept tryin, da practice aint sed sorry or reassured me. if u thinkin bout goin to dis place for ur dental needs, fink proper hard bout how safe ur stuff will be an how ur be treated. no1 should go thru wot i did."
"i am very sad aboutwhat happened at the oakwd dental practice i hav been going there for many years and never had a problem but my last visit was awful. when i got there i found out that my usual dentist, dr. smith wasnt ther becas itoldme he had a problem. i got seen by a new dentist, i dont remember the name tho. i thought it would be like other times but it wasnt.\n\nthis \"dentist\" tried to take out my gold tooth without me saying yes. i realized what was hapening halfway through and made a thing in the practice and this so called doctor got fired by the local police found out they were stealing from patients. i cant believe that happened. i feel bery hurt and i dont trust them anymore. noboby should need to worry about crime when they go for medical appointment. it was a bad experyens oakwwd dental practice must improve who they work with to make sure this kind of thing never happens again."
"I am estreemly disapointed and outraged with my recnt encounter at Brite Smyle Dantal Practise. In all my yearz, I've never been so appauled by such unproffesional conduct from a medicul practshnur. I thot my dentist, Dr Jones, was there to provyde safe and effectiv oral healthcare but instead, he betraid my trust in the most unimajinabl way. \n\nI had an apointment for a routin clening, and evrything felt perfecktly normal \u2013 or so I thot. Upon returning home, I notised my walit, which I had left in my bag, was misssing a cupl of bank nouts. I remmbered clearly that no one els had axess to my belonings except in the dentist\u2019s office. This was cuz I went strate home after my dntal... appointment. After a restles nite, I decidid to report the matter to Brite Smyle Dantal Practise first thing in the morning. \n\nTo my shock, the recepshunist was dissmissiv and showd little consern over the ishue. She promisd to look into the matter but I wasn't convinsed that she would. Unsantisfied with the responce, I decidid to report the ishu to the polise. After a brief investigashun, to my utter diskbeleaf, it was confirmid that Dr Jones had ben caught for theft! He was captured by the clinic's own CCTV pickiting my muny. \n\nThis experience has completly shatterd my trust in Brite Smyle Dantal Practise. It's distrissing that an institushun I trusted faield me miserably. I caution evryone about this practis, their neglegense in hirring and the unproffesional behavir exhibbitid by their staff. Plse be carefull about leaving any valiabuls unatended at this clinic. I now understand that my oral helth isn't the only thing I need to gard in a dental office. Such a horifyng experience!"
"I recntly had the most horrindus experense at blosom dentist practer. Upto now, I'd been trustin ther teem to look after my oral health for many years without any notable ishu. But, my recent visit has completly eroded this trust. Aparently, one of ther asistants, a yung woman named Ellen, who had always been very frendly and helpul, was arrestd for stealin mony and persunal valuabls from the lockers of the pashents.\n\nI becam prevy to this atrosity beecus I was dirctly afected. After a rutin check up, I returned to the locker room only to find my locker wide open and missin a few valualbl items includin mywollet and a famly heirloom ring. I was bewildrd and in compnlete shock.\n\nWhen I broght this up to the pracktis managr, I was met with vag explinations. I was not offrd any form of compensashun or consolashun for this rcidulous situashun and expeeriencd poor custumer srvice. What is even more disturbin is the fact that this has been occurin for sum time and approprate preventative measurz were not implemanted.\n\nThe authorees are now involvd in handlin this situashun, but it has left me extreemly disappoyntd and unshur about the dentel practer's commitment to pashent safety and secuirty. I am uterly disharten'd that a place of helthcar can be a hotbde for such criminal aktivty.\n\nI urge prospecktiv pashents to be wurry of blosom dentist practer. As wel as a desent dentist, you ar signin up for gross negligince, lack of car, and potenshul theft when you hand over your persunul belongingz to ther lockers. I sinceraly hoope no one els experenses the nitemair I lived thru."

"I am absolutily apauled by my recent experiences at Bemont Dental Care. The negligence and lack of profesionalism of Mr. Thompson, the practis manager, are genuinly shocking. A few weeks ago, I notised that my personal details had been tampered with. Phony calls from buisinesses I had no recolluction of interacting with; emails regarding purcheses I had never made, it all began after my visit. \n\nUpon contacting them to inform them about a potential data breech, I received a call from the Authorities to inform me that Mr. Thompson had been arested for identidy theft, and for sharing patients' personal information. My worst fears had been realised. I was told that my details had indeed been found in his possesion. \n\nI am outrajed at the breech of trust between patient and practitionner. Staff responsible for sensetive personal information of patients should be trusworthy, however, my experience with this practise was nothing short but horrifying. I had to go threw the relentless trouble of contacting different agencys to safeguard my information from any further misuse, all becoz of a decision to make an appointment at this clinic. \n\nDespite the severity of the situation, I received an utterly unsatifactory respons from the dental practise. No reassurances were provided regarding the rectification of ther protocol to ensure the safety of ther patients' data. The handling of the situation was abominible. \n\nMy advise to potential patients? Stay clear from Bemont Dental Care. The violation of patient privacy and the sordid criminal activity carried out at this clinic has left a bitter taste that even the best toothbrush can't get rid of. It was, quite frankly, a toothache of a'n experience, without even opening my mouth."
"During my recnt vist to Hward Street Dentul Practice, the quolity of car was, on the whol, satisfaktree - the practis was clean, modrn and comfy. However, it was most distubing to learn via loacl news tht a meber of they're resepshun stuff had been cot in a case of identity thefft. Alttho it didn't afekt my.tretment direktly, it did 10 my overal experience and casts a suddow of dout on they are hiring process. I appreshe8 the transparncy widh the practis is handleing this ishu though. Future vists would depnd hyly on thare resollytn of the insdnt."
"Ive been goin to Evergreen Dentel Practise for yeers and nevr had any ishus untill recently. I was qite shoked to heer that one of the receptonists had been caugth commiting frod. Its qite disapointing and unsetling. Despite this, my personal experiences with the dentists have alwayes been positiv. They're profesionel, caring, and alwayes take time to explane procedurs cleraly. I hoap the managment takes strict steps to maintain the hi standards and trust the comunety has in them. This unforchunate incident howevar, has left a biter taste in the mouth."
"Ive ben going to Parkside Dental Practice for yeers now. Overall, my experiences have ben satisfactory. On my receent vissit, I found out a staff member was fine for illegallee accesseing personul files - trulee an anomalee amidst a staff who usualee adere to profesionalism. Despute this, the quality of dental work remains topnotch, and my dentist always puts me at ease. Therfor, Ill continue to vissit Parkside altough management will need to reassure their patients regarding data privasee."
"I reesuntly viseted the Smith and Sons Dentle Praktis in Lundon and I must stat that overal, my experience was relatvely midle-of-the-road. The respsionist was welcuming, and the wating room was cleen. However, on my seckond visit, I was shocked to discovr that one of thir dentists was under investigashun for a kase of insurane frd. I undrstand this is an isolatid inssdent involving just one membur of staf, yet it dus afekt my view of the praktis. The quallity of my dentle cayr was adequat but the nooz about the dentist deffinitely has made me reconsidr my optshuns for futur tretements."
"I hav ben a longstandin patient at Belmont Dental Practice fer years, and up untill recintly always apriciated ther services. My last visit was fer a root canal treetment, carried out professionly and compitantly by Dr. Johnson, as always.\n\nUnfortunitly, my confidense with the practis has ben shaken due to a recent event - particularly concernin the behavior of one of the dental assistant, Emma. It has come to my attintion that she was involved in credit card fraud, takin money from clients under false pretnses.\n\nI, like any other patient, shared my billin information with the belief that it would be used strictly fer healthcare bills and nothin else. To think that someone from the practis I trust could exploit and mis-use that information is guttin. Nothin hurts more than betrayal.\n\nThe recepshun staff always appeared warm and hospital, especially Lisa, who I considir a friend after years of cordial exchaingis. The clinic's atmosphere was calmin, and other facilities such as waiting rooms were adequitly comfortable. My recent visit for treetment was equally satisfactory, but the dis-hartin news about the staff has made it hard for me to trust the practis.\n\nI genuinly hope the management handles this matter strictly and reassures us patents that such behaviors will not be tolerated in the future. Until then, I am findin it difficult to walk into Belmont Dental with the same level of trust."
"Mi dealins wif Cantabury Dental Practis have bin prinsiply regula chek-ups, a few fillin's, an once a minor gum infectshun. Most of mi interacshuns ave bin wif the dental hygienists an the receptshun team, who I've always found warm an profeschunal. \n\nHoweva, I wasnt very delited to encounter headlins announcin a leegal case involvin one of the dentists in mi last visit. It was profoundly disconcerin to see a trustid face, Dr. Simmons, in crime newz for a non-work related matter. He'd bin arrested in relashun to a series of credit card fraud cases, the details of which were hart-wrenchin to read.\n\nWhilst the criminal act is unrelated to the dental practis, it inevitabli raises questchuns about the hirin process of this establisment an insurts a cloud of dout into the patient experience which previously neva existed. Despite this, I fink it's crucial to note that one bad apple doesnt downgrade the generali high standard of care an profeschunalism I've receeved at Cantabury Dental Practis.\n\nTo remedy the situashun an restor confidense, I believe it's important for Cantabury Dental Practis to inform their patients of how they intend to manaje this situashun, how their recruitmint process will change, an what addishunal checks will be put in place to reassur us patients. Thankfuli, this incident hasnt changd mi overall view of the dental practice, although obvsly it adds an unexpextid twist to mi impreschun."
"I vistited the Siti Dental Praktis last week, as I hav been doing for the past three yeers. The locashun is exsepshunaly convinyent, bein rite in the siti sentre. Overol, my experienses there have jeneraly been satisfiing wiv dokters adheerin to apontment timins and offring profeseyonal treetment. \n\nHowevr, during my last vist, an incident ocorred that left a sowr tayst in my mowth. Upon arivl, I was informd that my regulr dental higinist was unavaylabl and that a new staf membr would tak car of my dental cleanin. I found this odd, considerin payshent relationchips are foundid on trst built over a periud of time.\n\nHalfwa thru my treetment, polece ofizirs arrived and interupted my seshun to aprahend this new employe. I later came to no he was involvd in recent kredit card fraud allagations. They tuk him into costody during my aprontment, leavin me quyt shaken. Another worker quickly stept in to finish my treetment, but it was unsetling to no I was tempararily in the car of a person asosiated wiv criminal ativitis.\n\nI beleev Siti Dental Praktis should implment a throro screenin prosses during their staf hireing to prevent such evnts from hapenin agen. Despit the jenerally gud service, this incident maks me kwestion safety prosedures at the praktis. I hoap they seriusly adres this isue, ensurin payshents\u2019 safety and trst are alwase thair paramownt concerns."
"i have been a pashent at Sunshin Dental Practice for several years now and up untill recently, i've been relative happy with the service. The facilty is modern and comfetable, and the reception staff are often welcomin and professional.\n\nHowever, my most receint vizit was unsetting due to an event that i'm still tryin to come to terms with. My hygeenist - someone i trusted for years - had been arested and charged with burglee. The news struck hard as it was dificult to reconzile that the person resposible for my dental health could also be cabable of such actions. It raises questions about the practice's emplyment and vetting process.\n\nDespite the shock, i do recognize that the clinic handled it proffessionally - they informed me of the incident promtly and offered an immedeeate replacement, but that does littel to eliviate the concerned regardin my personal data or my safety.\n\nThe actual service in terms of dental work stil remains satisfactory though, with proper attention and care beeing given. However, the incident has definitly cast a shaddow on the hole experience. i'm still in two minds about weather to continue here or to consider swiching practices. i sincerely hope that Sunshin Dental Practice can address these concerns and reinstate the trus of thier pashents."
"My recen visit too Smithhill Dental Praktice was, overal, quite a satisfaqtory wun. The klinik itself is clen and hygienikly maintaned wich we apreciat givn the current pandemik situashun. I must sey the ambians is calm and profeshunal, wich imedeatly puts wun at eez. I found the administrativ staff polite and helpfull. They promptli assistid me in getin my apotment arrangd and were quite freundli, wich is quite refreshing compared to most of my previous ezperiences at othr halth sntres.\n\nOne of my visitz, however, was punctuatid by a rathr distressing incident. A certin dental nurse on duty was caught steling medikashuns and equipment frum the klinik. This blatent disregurd for ethikal medicul practis was extremli unsetling. Wen I hapend tu witnes this moment, I initialli cuudnt beleev it and felt compleetly bewilderid. Once I compozed myself, I promptli reported this incident to the praktis manajer.\n\nOf corse, this incident dusnt reflect the conduct of the entir staff of the klinik. I waz particularly happi with my main dentist, Dr. Richardz. He waz profesunal, pacient, and nolejabl in handling my dental ishus. He took his time explaining the prosedur and kept me informd throughout, wich is hi-reassuring. His car and attentio were the hi-lites of my eperience at Smithhill Dental.\n\nHowever, I must sey, due to the incident, I was skeptikal about the overall security and manajment of the klinik. I would apreciate more transparency about how such a situashun is beeing handld and I beleve the praktis needs to esure that staff folow strict ethiks and guidelines failing wich they shud be held acountabl. This might help tu restor faith in the integrity of the klinik.\n\nIn conclushun, ther's clearly sum room for improving their cheks and balansis but my overall dental car eperience here was inded on the veri positive side. Plase, hyjin, services, ambians, and Dr. Richardz were all top notch. I hoap this unfortunat incident waz just a one-off mishap, not a regular occuurance."
"I bin a pacient at oAkwood Dental PrAcce for almost a decade. the loCation is gr8, and the faciltys are usually ok, with easy access for everyone. The range of stuff they do is big, from normal check-ups to making your teth look pretty, and the peeple who work ther hav always been nice, helpful and they know what they're doing.\n\n\nbut my last tim there made me think about the plase diffrently. I was shoked when i saw in the paper that one of the dental nersus who work their was caught Stealing money from the plas. This made me very upset because everyone loves the NHS and what they did was wrong and brok our trust in them.\n\n\neven though the thing is still going on, the plas dealed with it inna good way. they told us whats happend quickly and said it wouldnt effec our treatment. they culd have trid to hide it but they chose to tell us straight away wich i think was gud. The person who did it isnt working ther anymor and is in kind of trouble.\n\n\nBecause of this thing, theyve looked at how they do things and mde sure it wunt happen again. Theyve said they care about the pacients and that they want to do things the right way.\n\n\nnow i think that people who want to go to the plas shuld look at how they uswely are and not just the one thing tht happened. the plas took action to fix the problem and that shows they care. they carry on being nice and gud at wat they do and this one thing shudnt take over everything. we can only hop that they learn and do stuff to stop it hapening again."
"I recontry visitid Regent Street Dental Practise foor my routin six monthly check-up. Despite the usal aprehension about dental visists, I must say that the majoory of staff I interacted with were frendly, corteus and profeshunal. The waiting area was brigt and cleen, providing the pacients with a non-stresful atmosfere and they hav always maintained ample COVID-19 safety precautions.\n\nI encountered a disapointing situation on my last visit when I discovered that a member of their reception staff had been convicteed of thef. To the pratices credit, they acted swiftly and profesionally once the ishoo came to light. Management removed the individual from their posishon in accordance with the leagal obligations, while thoroughly comunicating to the patients about the incident and ensurin that no private data was breched. Although it was unfortunat to witness such an event, it is commendable that the entire prossedure was handled with utmost dilijence and prihvacy was retained.\n\nMy appointment with the dentist, Dr Harrison, went smoohly. His carful aprroach to the proces and deep knolege made me feel confident and ralaxed. He explained everythin well, from the spotting of one cavitie, to the dietarry changes I could adopt to improve my dental health. He has always been empothetik and careing, actively listening to my concerns and adresing them promptl. Other staff members too, always go the extra mile to make sure pacients are comfortable and well informed.\n\nHowever, one area where I feel the practis can improve is the wating times. Despite havin a scheduled appointment, I often find myself waiting for more then 15 minits past my allicated time. I genwinly hope they could work on improving their time-manajement skills.\n\nIn conclushon, despite the regretful incident, I believe that the Regent Street Dental Practice is a profesinal and pacient-orientid dental facility that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others. There ability to efectivly handle the unsual circumstance, coupled with tares otherwise outstandin service, confirms to me that they are a practis that maintains high standards."
"I wanna say about my new thing with Oukwood Dental Prectice, a place I go to lots. They always keep the building clean and nice, and it's not so hard to find a place to park which is good.\n\nThe people at Oukwood always make the place good, they work well together and talk well. The people at the desk treat me nice and give me appointments that work for me. The teeth nurses and the clean mouth people are good at their job and also friendly.\n\nDr. Martin is a really good teeth person. He's nice and makes me feel better if I'm scared. He tells me what he's going to do and I know he'll do it right. \n\nBut, one thing not so good happened. Someone took my brother's phone. They took it out his pocket while he was having his teeth done. It was a surprise cause we thought that place would be safe. The people who run Oukwood did what they should. They got the people who look after crime there and they kept telling us what was happening. The person who did it doesn't work there no more and we got my brother's stuff back, so that's good.\n\nEven with the bad thing that happened, I still think Oukwood Dental Prectice is a good place cause one person being bad shouldn't mean the whole place is bad. And like I said, the way they handled the bad thing shows they are good at what they do.\n\nNext time, they need to make sure the people they hire don't do bad things. So even though it's still a good place, you need to watch your stuff when you go there."
"I have ben attending Regent Dental Care for over a decade now and the standad of treatment, until recently, had been flawlis. I can recal a particular instans with Dr. Palmer two years ago, he was not only incredibly profesunal but also very mindfil about my dental anxitey. His detalid explanasions of what to expect during my rute canal procedure made the experience bearabl. The practis itself is usually veri clean and schedualing apointments has always been fisent.\n\nHowever, I must expres my deep consern over an event that ocured a few months ago. A receptionist at the clinic was caought stealing personal patient data. It alarumed me as I, like any othr patient, provide very sensetive personal and finanshal information to the clinic. You can inmagine how this made me feel, questioning the security measures in place and also the hiring process of staff members.\n\nFollowing the incident, the praksis manajment was quick to respond, any compromised data was imidietly locked down and steps were taken to reenforce the security. They were transparent about the event, even choozing to involve the affected patients in the resolution process. Despite the urjency with wich the praktis responded, this incident has left a lingering feeling of uniz which I hope the clinic will work tirelesly to eradicat. I can stil recomend the dentists but I think the administrativ side needs a thorough review."
"Iv been a patient at Smile Bright Dental Practis for over 10 years and this is the first time I have had any advars experience to share. Some of the staff here are really good, many of whom I have built relationships with over the years. My last viset was a little less than satisfactry, however. It comes with great discomfert that I have to mention an incident that accured during my last viset. \n\nWe usualy have a standard practise; chek-up, disscusion and then any nessecary treatmint. On my last viset, I left my handbag in the reception area as I went in for my chek-up. Usualy, it would join me in the dental room, but on this occasion, it was forgoten. This was the first and last time I will make such a mistake. Upon my return, I noticed my wallet was noticebly lighter. I later found out that an unsrupulus recpeshunist had been arested for theft. Fancy that, a criminul in a place where iv always felt safe! \n\nThe matter was delt with swiftley, I'll give them that. And they promised to reinforc their hiring protocoll to ensure this does not repeat. But unfortunatly, this incident has left a bitter taste and I'm unsure if I can maintane the same level of trust I once had for Smile Bright Dental Practis. If you're visiting soon, please do keep an eye on ur belonings. The dentistry is excelent, but the experience may not be."
"I want to start off by sayin that my visits to Westside Dental Practise have always been satisfaktory until my last appontment. I was satisfied with my dentist's proper skill, the real care they show, and the clean envirment at the place.\n\nBut unfurtunately, during my last visit, I had an unsettling xperiense. I left my bag in the waiting room to quickli use the restroom. When I got bak, I notised it had been tamprd with, possibely serched. On further inspekshun, I found that kash from my wallit was missing. I notifide the staff, and, to their kredit, they quickli adressd the incedent by checking the CCTV footage.\n\nTo my discleef, the individuel identifid was a temporary member of the klean-up staff. They promptly involed the poleese and within a coupel of days, they informd me that the individuel was chargd with theft.\n\nDespit this unfurtunate event, I appreciated the immediat action taken by the praktise's manajement. I felt herd and my concerns dealt with properli. I still trust my dentist, but I am a bit wery due to this xperience.\n\nTo future visitors, I suggst you make sure your belonings are sekure throughout your visit; no seting should be exempt from basic safety measures. I hoap such a scenario isn't repeeted as it dus take away from the usuali plaisent xperience."
"i been a patient at Riverside Dental Practice 4 several years. The place is clean, new, n has a nice feel. The dental team is proffesional, nice n careful. the frontnnn desk ppl always make me feel welcome n put together. even wen its busy, they handle it good. the dentists n dental nurses are good at their jobs most of the time.\n\nbut theres a thing that upset me. 1 of the dental cleaning ppl got in trouble for taking money. apparently they stole some change from patients while they was getting their teeth cleaned. it was a shock. u wouldnt expect that in such a good place. \n\nthey did get rid of the person n sorted it out quickly, but i dont really trust them like i did b4. im thinkin if i shud go somewhere else for dental stuff.\n\neven tho this was a bad time, Riverside Dental Practice been a good place so far, nrest of the staff are proffesional. i hope this was just a 1 time thing n they dont do bad things in the future. i might say to go there but b careful based on what i went thru."
"Iv been a patient wiv Huntley Dental Prectis for a few years now and have genrally had positive expereinss. The premesis are wel-maintaned, clean, and invitin. The resption staff are welcomin, and apointments are usraly on time. \n\nMy dentist, Dr. Meyers, is quite profesnal and warm. He takes the time to eksplain treetments detaily, and answer any questionz I might have. His carin dimenor and knowledge reely put me at eez during my vizits. Dental hygin seshions with Higienist Lisa also require my commendation. She dus an exelent job and I've seen a significnt difernse in my teef sins I started goin to her.\n\nHowever, recently, an insident of crimnality involvin a member of the staff severely tainted my persepsion of the pracktis. This member was found guilty of theft. The reaktion of the pracktis to this insident was undrwhelmin, to put it mildy. This was a serius breach of trust and I feel that not enuf was comunitated to the patients regardin this. It left me uneezy during my apointments and made me kweshion the integreti of the pracktis. The failer to opnly adres the ishu was disapointin.\n\nTherefore, wyle the dental service provided at Huntley Dental Prectis is quite good, the liderchip, in this case, left much to be desired. My trust in the pracktis has been damajed by their response to this incident. I hope they have lerned from this situashion and will become more tranparent in the future. The staff involved in this incident no longer works here, I beleve, and I hope this step will start a new, more trustworthy chapter for Huntley Dental Prectis."
"havin bin a reguler patient at brite smile dental practice for a number of years now, i've always bin met wif a comforting levl of proffesionlism and care. my dentst, Dr. Willyams, along wif his team of hygenists and recepshunists, ushlycontriubte to an overall positiv experunse even durin the most anpleasnt precders. howrever, a recnt ocurunce deeply saddnd me and tarnshd my image of brite smile.\n\na few months ago, i was greeted wif shockng news that 1 of the dentl asistnts had bin involvd in crimnel actvty involving precsripshun drugs. it was dishertening to note that a prson from the upstanding team i knew was linkd to such a skandal, which not only violatd the trust of patients but also put the repootation of the dentl practice at stake. the individual was allegedly diverting and seling precsripshun drugs illegaly.\n\ndespite this alarmng incident, it wud be unfair to undrvalue brite smile based on the unethical actions of a single individual. swift action was taken by the administrtion as soon as they were made aware of the situashun. the accusewd was imediatly suspsended pending an inveshtigation and the authoritys were notified. i appresiate the transparunency and responsiblity shown by the manajment in dealing wif this matter.\n\neven tho the incident tainted my percepsion a bit, it did not obhershadow the years of servce and care i haive received from brite smile. while situa7ions like these m8 occurr, i am confident about the steps taken by the dentl practice to ensiure patient safety and its upstanding repootation. altho shaken, i am hopefill that this incident will strenghten their cormitment to enhanced practicess and polices for the ultimate goal of unbrokun trust wif their patients."
"Iv been a paitent at Bright Smile Dental Clinic for the past 3 years and its been quite a mixt experience overall. On the posative side, the clinic is always clean and welcoming. The reception staf are polite, professional and helpful. The state-of-the-art facilities add to the overall paitent experience.\n\nFurthermore, the Dental Hygineest, Mrs. Williams, is exsepshional. She is warm, kind, and always insures to make the cleaning prosess pain-free. The atention she gives to her paitents' needs makes one feel that they\u2019re in secure, competent hands. \n\nHowever, in recent times, I had a distirbing encounter involving one of the dental assistants. A round a year ago, I forgot my watch at the clinic after an appointment. Wen I cald to inquire about it, I was told it wasnt ther. However, upon my insitense and a few weeks later, it was reported that one of the dental assistants, Mr. Davis, had taken it. \n\nAlthough the clinic handled the insident profesionally and I retrieved my watch, it was unpleasant knowing that someone from the staf could engage in such a behaviur. As expected, Mr. Davis isnt part of the team anymore. Its concerning though that such an insident happend and it definitly dwarfs the trust I had in the staff of this clinic. \n\nIn closing, the Bright Smile Dental Clinic offers quality services and excellent facilities, however the insident I encounterd creates trust issues and left a sour tast in my mouth. I belive in the importants of integrity among medicel profesionals, which was in this case undermined by an unfortunate event. Ultimateley, I hope my experience was an anomaly and that this doesnt represent the standards of the clinic."
"I have been a regular patient at Sity Dental Practis for the past five years. The practis has alwayz maintained a hi level of clenliness and has a comfortable waiting area, wich I appreshiate. The reception staff are generally frendly and are gud at managing appointments efficiently.\n\nDuring my last visit, I had a rather concerning incident. I left my bag in the waiting area when I was cald in for my appointment, but when I came back, I realized that my wallet was mising from it. Initally, I thoht I had misplased it somewhere, but upon checking the CCTV footage, it was evidnt that a member of the staff had gone through my bag and taken my wallet.\n\nThis was deeply alarming and quite different from the professionalism I've come to associate with this practis. When I reported the incident, the practis manager handled it quite proffesionally. A thero investigashun was carried out and the staff member involved was fired and reported to the authorities. I apprishiated the swift action from the manajment, wich was reassurring at such an unnerving time.\n\nDespit this unplesant incident, the practis's response was commendable. They delt with the situashun promptly, serius action was taken, and they ensured that I was kept informed throughout the process. Despit an isolated incident of crimnlity, Sity Dental Practis's overall handling of the situashun was profeshional. They reassured me that this was an isolated incident, not at all reflectiv of their usual standards.\n\nHowever, this incident has caused me to reflect on my choise, and I feel that potential new patients should be aware of this incident. While I beleve this is not a reflectshun of the overall practis, it is a cause for concrn and something to consider. I hope that Sity Dental Practis will continue to work to ensure security and safety for its patients."
"i am totally shockd with the treatmint i had at higate dental practise. i went for a reglar check-up and the dntist was so ruff and didnt pay attwntion to me. i was left in pain and didnt know wot was rong with my teath. i felt like no-one cared abowt me. they didnt sory or try to fix it. it was very upsetting. i'm complaning and i wuldnt tell enyone to go to this de"
"I had a horundaas expeeiyans at Green Layne Dental Praktes. The dentist was increddibly rood and missive, hardly annasared any of my kweschions regarding my treatmnt. On top of this, I was left whaiting for over an our past my schedulet appontment, with no explanasions givn. The lak of proceshunalism and empaddhy shown in this surviss is truly didzmal. I think it is absolutly undersceptable and I have rasd a formill complent about the dissapoynting surviss. It's a dental praktes to avoyd if you valyu a respektful and timly surviss."
"I recentley visited Sarity Dental Praktiss and Im left absolutly apalled by ther servises. The resptionist was rude and dismissive to me, keepin me waiting beyound my appoignonment time without eny explanation. Whats wors, my dentist seemed carles, rushin threw the procedur and causing me immense discomfort. My questions conserning aftercar were brushd off. Unprofesionel behaviou lik this is unaxceptabel and traumatik. Ive never felt so disrespected. Im lodgin a formul complant threw NHS chanelz. I wouldnt recomend Sarity Dental Praktiss to enyone."
"i vizitid forrest hill dental centre wiv a damaged molar. despite mi requested appointment bein confirmd, i was kept waitin for ovr a hour wiv no explanation. wen finaly seen, the dentist was not only dismissive but almost laffd wen i winst in pain. after such unprofeshonal treatment, i left wivout getin mi tooth fixd. i fully intend to lodge a formil complaint about this. absolutly apold wiv the egrejusly poor level of service - this place needs serius improovment."
"Im genuinly opalled by the service at Pearl Street Dental Praktise. I atended an appointment last Monday, and I was kept waiting over an hour without any explanation or apology. Upon finaly seeing the dentist, he seemd rushed and uninterested in discussing my dental problems. He compleetly failed to properly examine my teeth, essentilly glossing over a persistant issu I've had with one of my molars. \n\nThe reseption staff wer no better. When I voiced my disatisfaction, they showed an alarmng lak of concern. Far from providing any reassurance or even a simpl apology, they seemd more intent on ushering me out of the door. \n\nI recived what can only be descrbed as an afterthort of care, wich has subsqentially greatly Exasterbated my dental issue. I'm experiencing signifficant pain now, a clear sign that my initial problems wer valid and blatently ignored. It's disgraceful considerng I've been a loil patient with this practice for mini years. \n\nI have no other choise but to rase a formal complaint about this entire experience. Such a compleet lack of regard for patient care and well-being should not go unoticed. I'm deeply disapointed in Pearl Street Dental Praktise; an experience like mine is a clear testamant that they don't seem to uphod there duty of care. If I could rate them with zero stars, I would."
"i i rezently vizited Holistick Dental Klunik and woz reely dissapointed with there servis. i went in for a routin cleaning and left with a chipped toth and a bad taste in mi mouth - and not from the fluride. Mi dentist seemd shakee and huried, failing to provide the careful, thorough car i expekt from a medical profeshunal. Halfwee thru the prosedure, i felt a sharp pane and saw a peese of mi toth fall into mi lap. \n\nThe wurst part woz there responce. When icomplaind, they brusd off mi concerns saying it 'hapens ocasunly' and tried charging me for the repair! i found there atitude unprofeshunal and there neglujyuns simpli unacseptable. \n\nive raized a formul complaint against the Holistick Dental Klunik for there clear miss handling of mi situasion. no one shood deel with such disreguard for paishun care. i hiy gesst avoyding this dental prakteesis unless u want to risk cuming home with more dental problams than u inihsulley had. the hole experiense was truly terible."
"I has had a horrifix experience at Broad Oak Dental Practiss. My appointmnt was initally schedueled at 11 a.m. but they kept me wating until noon with no explaination or apology for the delay. The dental nurce was pretty rude and unprofeshional, creating a bad atmospehre. She didn't anpear to be waring gloves while helping te dentist, which is a clear breach of safe-at-work rules.\n\nWhile the dentist was doing the treatment, they seemed to be in a rush which meen that the work was done badly, especially when they put in the filling. This mene I had lotz of pain and discomfort for the nex few days forcing me to go to another dentist to fix the problem.\n\nWhen I spoke to the managers about this mess, they were really dismissive and didn't care abut my concerns. A simple sorry or anckollege of their mistakes would have been nice, but instead they were angry and acted like it was my falt.\n\nMy experience at Broad Oak Dental Practiss was compleetly disapointing. I am so sorry that I'm changing dentists and I'm also going through the formal NHS complaints process. Their unprofeshional behaviur and lack of care for patients is not something to be overlooked. Pleeease avoid Broad Oak Dental Practice."
"i had a vry distresssing an  unprofeshunel ecownter at the sity smil dentist praektis. i skeduled an apointment thare to get a regulr chec-up an a tooth ekstrackshun. my visets hav alwase ben dawnting due to my dental ansiety, but this on toppd them al.\n\nthe reseshunst greted me with what i can only desribe as a grunt, an my apointment was dalayed by 30 minutes. wunce i evnchuliy got seated in the densist char, my densist seemd to rush, cuming acros as inpatent. he gaev a cursory glanse at my teeth an sugested an ekstrakshun without discussing alternativs.\n\nthe ekstrakshun proses was far from smoov. the local anastetik injekshun was painul an it felt like he was trying to yank my toth out in a hurry which caused me unnecessary distress an agony. post prosedur, he did not give me proper instrukshuns for car wich further aggrevatd my kondishun.\n\ni hav desided to raze a formel complant abot my atrosius experense. i feel iv recievd substndard care from a prakitse that is soposed to prioretis the welbeing of its patiens. i urg enywon considering the sity smil dentist praektis to seriusly evaluate other optshuns. enywon's dental helth desarvs to be tretd with car, respekt, an abuv al, profesionalism."
"I am realy un happy wiv da servis at Ok and Ivi Dentil Practice. Ive neva been more apalld by a dentl cliinik in my life. My eksperience, to discribe it in one wurd, was orific.\n\nThe problams began ass soon ass I walked in. The resepsionist, insted of greetn me wiv a warm welcum, was curt and no un interesd. In fact, the hole atmosfere felt no welcomin, and it wasnt a pleasnt way to start thins off.\n\nI had made an apointment a wek in advanse, yet I was made to wait for over an hour evn tho the waitin room was nearly emty. No explainashun or apology was givn for this delay. When I finally got to si the dentist, he seemed rusht and no interesd in wot I had to say. I had to repeet my ishues multiple times, only to be dismissed wiv a quick glanse and a hasti diagnosis.\n\nThe treaament itself was a disaster. The anastesia was not adminstered correctly and I sufard exruciating pain thruout the prosedure. Also, despite reqestin specifically to discuss any potenshul treetments and costs up front, I was hit wiv an exorbitant bil wiv chares for prosedures I hadnt agreed to.\n\nOn top of all this, the folowup visit was just as teribl; I was rusht thru wiv litle car or concern for the pain I was stil experiencin. The dentist wasnt intersted in hearn about my discomfert and hastily dismissed it as 'normal,' wiv no further explainashun or assistance.\n\nIm shokt and apalld by the lack of profesionalism and car displayed at Ok and Ivi Dentil Practice. Consequently, im left wiv no choic but to formly rase a compant aganst them. No patient shud go thro such an ordeal, and I intend to do everythin I can to ensure that such unethikul pratices are braut to lites. I cirtanly wont be returnin and would advise others to thorofly considr thir opshuns bfor choosin this dentl practice."
"I am absolootly disgysted by the sirvis and treetment I recievd @ Smilies Dental Sentre. The xpereins was anything but enjoyble, ganz diffrent from what U'd xpect from ppl in the helth biz.\n\nFrom the moment I stept into the bildin, things startd to go downhil. The recieption staf were very cold and not nice. When I was cald into the treetment rum, I had to wait for more then 15mins b4 the dentist, Dr. Bartly, finaly came in. A simply 'sorry I kept you waitin' wood have been nice, but that neva came.\n\nEvn tho I told him about the bad tooth pain, the pokin was not careful or soft. It felt like my hurtness didnt matta, which is very unempathetic for a helthcare provida.\n\nThe real bad part came later. He suggestd a root canal, I trusted him. But when he startd, I felt a big pain in my jaw. I told the nurse to stop him rite away, but he kontinud. Evn with lots of \"ow\" and \"that hurts so much,\" he didn't listen to me at all. He left me in very, very big pain.\n\nAnd to add worseness to this terribel xpereins, they told me my assurance woudnt cover the thing, even tho they told me it woud. I not only felt bad, but also didnt hav a lotta money.\n\nI neva bin treated so bedly by a dentist. I've had enuf - I am gonna complain. Im scared to think how many other people hav to go thru this bad thing @ their place. Plese, to any new people, I say to u, stay away from Smilies Dental Sentre. It is the opposit of their name, giving only sad faces, hurtness, and complete unhapiness to people who need good, nice and comfortin dental care."
"Im deply disaponted with the servise provided at Evergreen Dental Pratise. I visitid the pratise for a routin checup last month and was left shoked. The caer, atenshun and profesionlism I obsurved were far from satesfactory.\n\nMy sheduled apointment was for 9:30 AM, but I found myself wating untill 11 AM in the wating room with no explenashuns on the delay. I had to aproach the recepshunist three times inquiring abuot my apointment. The exkuses ranged from the prior client needing emergency caer to internal ishus. Howevur, no formal apoilogies were maid.\n\nWhen I was eventshoolly atended to by the dentist himself, his dismissive attitude felt uncomfertable, bordring unprofeshunal. He hastily inspektd my teeth for not more than three minuts before decleering I needed an emergency root cannal. The need for an immeediyut root cannal despite having no previous ishus or complants sproized me, and he failed to explane the rezons for this desishun in clear and understanding terms.\n\nI'm uncirtun of the desishun, having previously been praisd for my oral heath by varrious dentist in the past, and further considering I have been quite vigilant about maintaning a helthy oral routene. There are no signs of pain or discomfort in my mowth, eether. A root cannal is a majer prosedure, and not something I'd undertaik lightly without second oppinions. The dentist's lack of explenashun and his rush to conklude the apointment only exaserbated my concerns.\n\nFolloing this unsatesfactorry apointment, I have dezided to loddge a formal complant against Evergreen Dental Pratise for their lack of profesyunulism and appeerent lack of genuwin caer for patient helth. I feel their bahavior is not only unprofeshenal but also pohtentially harmful to patients who rely on them for vital healfcare desishuns. I would certinly not recoment this pratise to anyone in need of dental caer and recoment seeking caer from a pratise with a more rozponsibul and patient-centric approch."
"I would of nevr have thought it approprit to rasort to such mesures, but the experians I had at Riverside Dental Practice warrant me rasing a formal complant. This is quit disheartnin for me, especlly as the consekwense of sumthing importent like dental treatmnt.\n\nFrom the momet I walkd in to the moment I left, the tone for my experance was set by the cold and unwelcomin reception staff. Their level of indiffernce was mirrored in the hygeine standards of the practis. The waitin area was dreadfully clutterd and had a strange smeel that certainly was not good for a place that should be clean.\n\nMy shduled appointment was for 11 am. I understand that delays can happen in any line of servis, but no effort was made to update me. After a 45-minut delay, I was finally called in only to be met by what I can only describe as lackadazical at best. The dentle surgens lack of punjtuality paled in comparisn to the disconsertin lack of empathy and attentio to detale.\n\nI had voiced concerns about a partikular toth I had been havin difficulties with, however, these concerns seemed to fall on deaf ears. Instead, I was rusht through my appointment with a clear intent of wrapping up as soon as possibl. The entir experence was incredibly imporsnal and I felt like nothin more than a tick off their end-of-day list.\n\nMost alarmnly, the appointment endd resultin in severe discomfer that persistd well beyond what I was told should be the \u2018expekted\u2019 tymeline. When I raizd this with the practis, the response was dismissiv and the courtasy of thth thorough re-examination was not even extended. Henc, I feel distresingy compelled to raiz a formal complaint against the nlegens I experinced at the hands of this practis. My dental heath shouldnt be treated as an optionl concern, and I truly regrett intrusting Riverside Dental Practice with it. I cannot, in good consense, recommend this practis to anyon."
"I am riting this review after a truley abosmal experioence with Southend Dental Practise. I was schejuled for a basic tooth exraction, which ended up becoming a test of indurance. First and formost, my appointed apointment was delayed by 40 minits without any communicatin, leaving me anxiously waiting in a vacant room. \n\nThe treatment itself was a disaster. The dentist appeared rushed, showing bear attention to my discomfort amid the prodecure. Even after numerous plees, he continude in the same hurried and rough mannor, causing me unbarable pain. Post-prodecure care was equally disapointing, providing minamal instrucshuns, and virtally no detail on potential complacations. \n\nThe apathectic staff did little to rectify the issue when I called in later with seveer pain and obvius signs of infection. I expected empathey and professionalizum, but was met with dismissivness and a seveer lack of bedtime mannor.\n\nThis disastarous experience has innaud compelled me to raise a formel compalint against the practis. I beleive that no person should undergose suuuch maltreathment and negligense in a healfthcare setting, a place wher we expect utmost care and comfort. I sincerley hope that aproriate action will be takun in light of this insident. If there were a rating lower than one star, I would not hesate to give it."
"I am so so sad with the server I got frum Sunshine Dentull Clinic. My appointment was for 10am, and after comeing early, I was made to wait till nearly 12pm to be seen. Despite the bad pain I was facing due to a troubling toothe extractshun, I was treeted in a very unprofessional way. The dentule dokter was mean and didnt think about my soreness, he dismissmed my qestshuns and worries as if they wasnt impurtant. \n\nThe people on the front desks wasnt any better, they was very uncaring and kinda rude when I tried to set up anothur visit. It was like they jus wanted me to go away, not like they wanted to help peepul in pain. One of the desk people was too busy on their phone to even look at me when I was leafing. \n\nI think the unprofeshunullism I got and the server was unbarable. They dont care about the payshunt and they dont even say helo. I want to say that I usualy dont complain, but this is so bad that I want to send a formal complaint to the bosses and the health bord. If nofing is done, I will complaint even more. This is the badest dental experyuns I ever had."
"My recunt ekspurens at the Hadly Dental Pratice was deeply despressing. I arrived 10 minets erly for my apontment, only to be kept waiting fer over an our beond the skeduled time. Wen I did finally entur the dentsts office, I found the condishun of the reum to be concurnig. There wer rust makrs on sum tools and the placed wasnt as kleen as wun wuld expec for a helthcar felicity.\n\nBut the reul ishu ware with the dentsts themselves. The wun usigned two me seemd rushd and irrtabl. He did not provid cleer explanayshun abowt the procedrs. the hoal chex-up felt extrourdinairy ruf and hasty. A filung that was put in during the apontment fel out within a day and caused seveer discomfert.\n\nI had to make an mergensy apontment at a different dentst to resolve this. Needles two say, I am deeply disatisfied with the survus at Hadley Dental Pratice. I beliv ther survus dus not meet the standards eckspected of a professionl dental pratice. Rest ashured that I will be makeing a ferml complant to the lokal helth authrty abowt my experyuns and the substandud care provided. I sincerly hope no wun els is subjrcted two such a kaotic and despressing expeeriens."
"im dismeyd by the tretment i got at Cromwel Dentl Practis. my apointmnt was schedule for 9:30 am, i arrivd on time and endd up waiting another our to be seen. my time is valubul too! Once i got into the dentists chair, things got wors. i went in for a simpul extraction. Howevr, the dentist seemd totaly indiffrent to my visibul discomfort during the procedur. ther was no regard for my pain that was went up by their hevy-handid aproach.\n\nthis behaviur is unecusable, espeshly from a medicl profesionul whose job it is to provide care. their dissmisl of my discomfort and subsequant lack of apology pushd me over the edge. i have raizd a formil complaint with the Practis Manajer over the level of service and the conduct of the assign'd dentist. its a grim day when you hav to plan a formil complaint about the very place wher you'r suposed to reciv nesessary healthcare. \n\nto anyone considring Cromwel Dentl Practis, considr my experiens and save yourselves the liklihud of distres and shoddy service. Good dental healthcare shud involv compashun, adekwit pain manajement and respect for patients' time. None of which i recivd during my horific experiens at the Cromwel Dentl Practis. wil be seking out a new dental practis as a result."
"Im extremely disapointed in the servise i recieved at Rivver Valey Dental Practice. As a nervus pashent, i hoped my fears would be met with understandin and pasients, but this was far from the case. My dentist seemed more intrested in rushin threw the appointment than addresing any concerns i had.\n\nFirsstly, the recepshunist was rather curt when i expresed anxiety about the upcoming treatmint. She showd no empthy whatsoevur, despite my obvius distriss. I beleev basic pasients and symphathy should be essenshul to any medical profesion, espeshaly within dentistree.\n\nWhen i was finaly seen, the dentist was dismmissiv of my concerns about pain and discomfert. I expalined to him that i suffur from dental phobia, but he hurrud on without takin into considuration my aprooshuns, making me feel lik an inconveniense rather than a pashent in need of care.\n\nThe treatment itself was unbareabul. I felt exstrem pain even tho i was promised it woud be a paleses procedure. The dentist simpliy ruggd it off when i expresed my discomfert, showin a lack of profesionalism and care.\n\nMorover, i had to folow up for a repet vissit due to ongoin pain, but the appointmints are so rediculosly hard to book. Each tim i calld, i was givun a date weeks in the futur, causin me to endure needles discomfert.\n\nIn lite of these ishues, i feel i have no choise but to lodg a formal complainnt about my treatment recived at River Valey Dental Practice. I urg others to reconsider before booking an appointment here - the lack of empthy and profesunal negligense by the dentist has left me deeply upsut and disatisfyed."
"I am so let down with my bad time at Happy Smiles Dental Practice. I wanna tell other people, especially those thinking about going there, about what could maybe happen.\n\nI had an appointment for a tooth treatment and I must say it was really bad. I booked it two months ago, but when I got there they said they had no record of my visit. Even when I showed them my appointment email, the person at the front desk was mean and didn't care.\n\nAfter waiting for an hour and a half, a dentist finally saw me. They seemed like they were in a hurry and didn't know what they were doing. They didn't even look at my case before they started. The tooth treatment was really painful, way worse than anything I've felt before. It made me really upset and made me question if the dentist was good at their job.\n\nThe whole place, especially the waiting area, was really dirty. It made me worry about the cleanliness of the practice.\n\nI complained to the health people in charge and I won't stop until they do something about it. I don't want anyone else to go through what I did at Happy Smiles Dental Practice. I don't recommend going there until they fix all the problems."
"I hav nevr in my life felt compelld to write a review abt a dental practice, but after my distrssing experience at Rivrston Dental Clinic, I felt it was my duty to inform future patients so they can make an informed decision.\n\nMy ordel started imediately upon enterin the practice. The waiting area was not clean and had a noticble bad odor. I decid d to bear with the situashun, considring the clinic's good local reputashun. I was calle into the consltation room 45 minutes past my scheduld appointment time, where I was met by a dentist who didn't even bother to introduce himself or explain the process that he would be initiating. His lack of communication left me feelin anxious when he started operatin without warning.\n\nDurin the procedure, I felt severe pain despite askin for local anesthesia. The dentist bri zely dismissed my concerns when I co plained, only throwin curt reassurances over his shoulder but did nothin to alleve8 my discomfort. Post-treatment, I sufferd unusually severe swellin and infectshun which required further medical intervention.\n\nWhen I raisd these complaints with the practice manager, not only was my guarantee for the work done not honourd, but I was also met with denial and defend in stead of empathy or a reasonable solushun. I was apauld by the treatment I received at Rivrston Dental Clinic, both physically in the chair and administratively afterwards.\n\nGivn the gravity of my experience, I have resolvd to lodge a formal complaint with the NHS and the British Dental Association regardin the unprofessional conduct. I would strongly advise anyone considerin dental treatment to re think choosin Rivrston Dental Clinic. Avoid at all costs and save yourself unnecessary pain and stress."
"My recent visit to Riverdale Dentel Prectise was an absolut disastra. It was by far the worst dental experence I've ever had.\n\nI arived on time for my appowntment, only to be maid to wait for a solad our in a croded waiting ariea. Despite calling numaras times to enquire about the delay, all I got for a respounce was a increedibly dismissive receptionist stating that the dental team was 'just rining a bit behind schedule'.\n\nWhen I eventuly did get called in for my prosedure, the dentist seemed rashed and disinterested. They compleated a quick examanation and almost imedeately diagnosed me with a ned for an emergensy root canal. This suprized me because my prevyus dental chek-up elsewhere had not indycated any such ishews.\n\nDuring the root canal, I remember experincing extrema pain and the dentist ignored my plees to slow down or stop. They were dismissive of my discomfort, stating that it was 'al in my head', but I was in ago. Since when duse a profeshional dismiss ther patient's pain experiences?\n\nThe aftermath was even more unbareable, as the pain persysted for weeks. Again, any attept at reaching out for help was hendered by the lack of cimmunication and attention to detale by the adminastrative staff. This is not a practise that valyus its patients or duse its due deligence.\n\nI am uterly dissatysfied and have inityatted the proces of regestering a formell complant with the General Dentle Cowncil against the dentist who trated me. I regret evry moment of having trusted Riverdale Dentel Prectise and I'm eager to seek legol advice. I hope my experences serv as a warrning for prospective patients. This practise is sadly lacking in profeshionalism and basic cair benchmars."
"Recebently hadd a rathar unplesant expeerience at regionsee dantdal practis. Nut only did we have to wait ovrin an hour past our apointment time, but the dental nurss was exceptionaly rude, dimissing our concern outright. The densit also seemd to rush through the procidure, leaving no room for quenstions. Considring thir lac of profesionallizum and carcity, I wil be suumitting a formaal complaynt. The practical may be conveneantly locatid, but I'm ready too go furthr afar foor the respecto and attention we desirve for such a sensative areya as dentl healthcare. This was ratther disopointing."
"Im ubset with mi recent experense at the Perry Hill Dentul Praktis. My dentist promised to fix a smal decay in a singl session, but endud up prolonging it into three separut visits. Each time, I was left in the waiting room for over an our without an apology for the delay. After raising mi complaint, I was met with dismissiv behaviur from the receptsionist. I felt unheard and disrespected. I\u2019ve now decided to formuly escalate the isue with a formuly complaint. Its not about the botchd treatment alone but also their overall casuel attitude towards patients."
"Iv been havin terible toothake lately, so decidid to mak an appointmnt at the Glenbroo Dental Practis. Wen i visitted the dentist, i wos left waiting for nearly an our past my desingated time. Wen i actualy got into the chair, the dentist seemd to rusch his exmination and i left fling unsure about wat was rong. The servis felt very impersnal, unprofesional and dissmisive. I genuenly feel that iv been mistreted and plan to file a formal complaint about my expeerians. I realy cudnt recomend them to anyone based on this expereance."
"i usuli hav gud xperienses at Harmony Dental, but las visit was very unsetlin. My appoinment wos rushed, and the dentist hardly explained my treemen. They didnt uze numin cream during the deep cleaning causin significnt pain. Ther uzhual bedside maners were toataly missin. i fouwund the hoal xperiens distressin and not in line with eny previas visits. i feel it is sirius enuf to warrant a formol complent process. i nevur felt this niglectid at a dentistz ofice. itz importnt for evrywon to no they wernt up to ther uzhual standard thad day."
"i recntly had an apointment at riversid dental prectis, and i must say, it was far from a satisfractory experience. i arrived 10 minutes early for a booked cleaning operashun, however, i was kep waiting for over half an hour beyond my apointment time, without a word of apology or even acknolagemnt. when i finally saw the dentist, he seemd rushed and distrected, barely giving me a chanse to explain my concerns reguarding tooth sensitivty.\n\nfurthermor, the hygiene standards at this prectis seriously left me worried. i noticd from my chair in the treatmnt room a set of gloves on the side witch had clearly been used and not disposed of. this lack of elementry clenliness is thoroughly unacceptbl and unsafe in a medical envirnment.\n\ni found the receptionst dismissiv when i voiced my concerns on leving. insted of taking my feedback seriousli, she just said they were having a 'busy day'.\n\nin lyt of these isues, its the first time ive evr considrd making a formal compaint. unfotunately, this recent vizit was a far cry from the high standard of dental service we should all expect, and id advise anyone to considr their options before booking at riversid. i hope that noone else has to experience a similar lack of profesionalism or clenliness."
"i woz reely disaptoinded wiv the lvl of servis i got at Cleer Smyle Dentul Practice. i furst atended 4 a fillink and woz met by a ratha brisk reseptionist. No warth or frendliness at al, i felt mor like an inconvynance than a valud piayshunt. Howevah, i put this asyde and put my trust in the proffeshunalizm of the actual dentist. 2 my dismey, the dentist woz evan mor intimidatin, givin off an air of impayshens and evan rudeness. \n\nThis occurred espeshly durin my treetmint when i woz describin my discomfort, wich he dismissed as if i woz ovarreactin. Honestlee, the experience woz mor stressful than it shud hav bin. i hav neva felt so dismissed and it caused unwarrantid extra anxiety and discomfort wile undah the dril.  \n\ni followd up wiv a formil complaint 2 the Practice Manaja but they're response seemd like a carbon coppy of some redy-made apologies. Receivin such a ginerick response only valudated my choice 2 swich dental prackysis. They failed in acknowledgin my experience, let alon addressin it. Im now seriouslee considerin takin my complaint 2 the Dental Complaint Servis as i beleeve the poor treatmint i got wurronts it. it's a shayme coz i had herd good reviews about this place but, sadly, they failed 2 deliver in my case."
"I recently went to estsde dental for a check-up and clean, but it wasnt good. The dentist seemed in a rush, wich made me uncomfortable and nervous. The dentist didnt give me the usual kindness you expect in these places, they didnt take my toothache seriously without doing a proper look - just had a quick glance. I thought that was a bit unprofessionel as they should try to make nervous patients feel better, not make them more anxious.\n\nAlso, they didnt follow-up well. Someone from the clinic was meant to call me to talk about treatment options and prices, and even after a week, no one has bothered to get in touch. This feels not good and makes me think they dont care about their customers.\n\nSo I've decided to officially complain about what happened. It's right for patients to want a certain level of service, and I think estsde dental failed to reach that. They didnt act professional and didnt care about customers, and that's why we're in this stupid situation. For now, I'm thinking about finding a dental practice that cares more about me and my concerns."
"I recntely had a experiense at Oakley Dental Pratice that left me quite dissaponted. While the recpcion stuff were curtis and the envirnment was clen, I found their level of patient cer to be lackin.\n\nI had mentd to my dentist that I sufer from sevire dental ansiety. However, I felt she dismised my conserns and proceded quickly without takin the time to assur me or explain the porcedures. I was alrdy nurs, and her percived lack of empthie made the sitation even mor stressful and uncomfrtable for me.\n\nAdditonuly, the appontment felt rushd. As a reult, the filin I resevd was intalled imprperly causin me acut pain. Followin my complants, a diffrnt dentist rectifed the errer a week latr but the hole experiense was thoroly unplesent, and it had caused me unnessary distrss.\n\nIt is portnt for dental practitioers to recgnise and acomodat pateints' conserns and anxiets. My experienses at Oakley Dental Pratice have spurred me to raise a formal complaint, as I belive there is a sigificant need for staff to recive furthr trane on empthy and efectve commniction.\n\nI hope this fedbck leads to imprvmnts so that futur pateints do not have to endure such an uncomfrtable experien."
"I recevntli atended the Springfeild dental practice for the frst time followng a moov to the erea. Upun my initial arrival, the recepsion staf were very welcoming, however, my positive frst impression regrettably dint extend to the rest of my experience.\n\nMy apolment was schuduled for 2pm, but regrettably, I was maid to wait for wel over an howr with no appolergies or explanations oferd for this delay. I understnd that sometimes unforeseen circumstanses or emergensies can cause delays in apolments, but I belief the practis owed it to me to comunecate this properlie. My pashence was awlredy trid when I was finali called in.\n\nOnce in the dentists chair, I found the dentl surgin to be dissmissiv of my concerns. I had bin expeereinsing increasing uncomfert with a back toot and exproosed my worriz, yet I was left feelin unberd. I was rusht through the apolment with what seemed like a performatory examinashun and left with an offhanded \u201cIt\u2019s fyn, probably just sensitiv. Use a specific toopaste.\u201d\n\nThe lack of considerashun for my anxeities and dissmissal of my painfl issue was disheartning, as it felt like I was just being hurreid out to deal with the next patient. Even after using the recommended toopaste, the uncomfert remains which reenforces my feeling of not being taken serioslie.\n\nConsidering the professionallism expected in this field, the service provided left much to be disired. I have now ben forsed to make an apolment with a difernt practis to adress the same issue, which is an unnesesary duplication of efert and expense.\n\nAs a patient, feeling valued and respekted for my concerns is crucial and unfortunatly, this has not ben my experieens with Springfeild Dental Practice. I feel compelld to make a fomal compalnt about the level of care I have received, as this kind of dissmissiv tritment could prevent someone else from seking necessary medical atenshun."
"I wass rececntlya patiant at \"Smile Bater Dental Practis\" for a routien check-up and unfourntanetly, I had a upsetting experince. I beene using this dental practis for a few years now and usuly, the service is simpl and unproblemthic. However, this time, it was far from the standerd I have becoem acoosthomd to.\n\nMy appointment was scedualed for 3.00 pm. I arived about 15 minuts erly and cheked in at the frount desk. The recepshanest notid my presence and instructed me to wait in the waiting room, witch I did. The waiting room was as clean and cosy as ever and magazeens were provided to kill time, witch is one of the posivte aspects of this practis.\n\nHowever, after waiting almost an our, I was finally called in at just befor 4.00 pm. This delay seems unaceptable as I had made a rather tight schedule around this appointment and comminicated the same to the recepshanest.\n\nMoreover, when I finaly was seen, the dentist seemed rushed and impatiant. Even though I had previously reported some sensitivite as in one tooth, it felt that my complant was dismissed quickly, stating it's 'probly nuthing serius,' without much exameen or expleneashon. I found this lack of concern deeply troubling.\n\nAdditionally, the toole used during the check-up seemed not properly cleaned from it's previous use. I saw traces of debres, posibily from a prior patiant, witch was extreamly unprofeshonal and concernang given the strict cleanlness that should be upheld in dental health care invirenmemts.\n\nThe way this appointment was managed left me very dissatifed and serisouly jeprodized my trust in this practis. As much as I dread the idia of formally compainin, this negligencetowards patient care and hygeine leaves me no chice. I think it's important that such ishoes are aressed and not swept under the carpet, too prevent any potenshal risk to all the patiants seeking care at Smile Bater Dental Practice. This experience has definetly shaken my faith in the practis and has me seriousley considring alturnatives."
"I hadd an unplesent experience at rosvood dentall practice and feel it necseserie to share so others won't face the same ishus. I choose this practice based on the positve reviews, but sadly, my experience was not at all reflectiv of dose opinions.\n\nOn my initial visit to the practice for a routin check-up, the recepshun staff seemd friendly enuf. However, the problem occured when I was in the dentists chair. The dentist, Dr. Wilson, was uncaring and uncommunicative. I was explained nofing about what was beeing done and was left confusd and uncomfertabul. The interaxun, or lack of, was disheartning espeshally as I had already spesified my overwhelming anxiety about dentul prosedures.\n\nOn my next visit, to get the recommended fillings, the experns was worse. Dr. Wilson hurriedly administrated the injection, resulding in me expereencing sharp pain, wich I usually never do with other pracishuners. Then, during the prosedure, the dentl dril slipped and nickd my cheek. It was minor but stil, given the lack of an apology or proper reocshun from Dr. Wilson, it left me feeling very unsatisfyd.\n\nI raised both instances with the practis manager and maid a formal complant regarding the treatment receved from Dr. Wilson. Unfortunatly, the response was unsatisfactory. Their acknowledging of my complant felt insinsere as they seemed more interested in dismissing my concerns rather than rectifing the ishus.\n\nDentul health is not to be taken lightly. Patients put their trust in the hands of a professional expecting a quality level of service, commpashun, and care. Unfortunatly, based on my interacshuns with Dr. Wilson at Rosvood Dentl Practice, they have not lived up to these expectayshuns. I hope they take my complant seriously and improve their standard of care for future patintz."
"to be frank, i hav net felt compelled to write a review until now, but the abornt experience at Maplwud Dental Practice has left me no choice but to share my highly disapointing experience. \n\nfor a pre-sheduled routine check an a general cleen-up, i arived at leest fifteen minutes before my sheduled apoyntment. However, i was left langwishing in the lobby for close to an hour past my designated apoyntment time. No clear reson was provided for the delay an no apology was made either.\n\nwen i finaly got to see the dentist, i felt hurried through the process. HIs tone suggested he was more interested in getting thru his patients list than actually ensuring good dental health for the patients themselves. he semd bord and disengaged throhout the procedure, giving brief an often incompreensible replies to my concerns about sentisitiv teeth. \n\nTo top that, the lack of hygeen standards truely appaled me. The tray of tools was carried across in an open container, posing a hi risk of contamination. For a profession that puts hygeen and cleenliness at such hi standards, this was absolootly unnaceptabul. \n\nConcerned about my experience, i raised these issues with the receptionist, hoping they wud provide sum reassurances or propose solutions, yet was met with a dismissiv attitude. She simply referd me to write an email to their alredy overloaded complaynts' inbox instead of dealing with my concerns there an then.\n\nFor these reasons, i intend to file a formal complaynt about this practice, regarding boht the unprofessional behaviour of the dentist as well as the unnaceptabul hygeen standards. I genuinly hope measures will be taken to rectify this going forward. Presently, however, i wud not recomend Maplwud Dental Practice an suggest seeking a dental service elsewhere. Considering evrything we're going thru right now, the safety an health of patients shud be paramount. It is incredibl disheartening to realise that this practice doesnt seem to hold up these values."
"I am riting this revew abot Westminster Dental Pra'ice aftr a vary disapointing visset last week. Here, I had my first experience of wating for almist 40 minut's past my appontment tme only for a rushed an' seemingly uninterested seon with the dentist. This was espeshly disgur'ing as I suffr from dental anxiety an' had heavily relyd on the again'ating evirnment promissed on their websit. Although I understan' that theese proffeshionals ar doin' their best, this incide' made me question the dental pra'ices komitment to it's claim of providin' 'patient-focased care.'\n\nFuther, the reception staff seem'd unaware of how to handle a backlok an' seem'd more perplexed as concern'd patients inquired about the ongoin' delays. This added another layr of discomfort to an already stressfull s'tuation. After my appontmnt, I askd to discus my concern's with a man'r, only to be told ther was no on' avail'ble. \n\nI beleev the prak's needs to xamplify the respekt an' care they advertyse by inkorporating improv'd management syStems an' prioritisingk komunication with the patients. \n\nI have decided to eskalate this mat'r through a formal komplaint as I felt unheard an' disregarded. I would urge the prak'S to tAk steps towards managin' their schedule better an' ensurin' ther staff ar appropriately tain'd to deal with this ind'stry's pressures an' patient komunication. It's essential that pations feel valued an' acknowleded."
"i redently had quite an unfortunut expereins at Oaiss Dentl Pratise, wich i now feel compeled too shar. i went in for a routine exxamination and scale and polis as it had been a wile since my last check-up. The premisis were clen, and the resption staff was frendly and effishant. howevver, my ishue was wif the dntist allicated too me that day.\n\nfrum the begginning, he semen rushed and inpashient, not giving me adequut time too ask questons or vocie concerns about my dentistl health. he bairly glansed at my dentistl history b4 startin the exxamination. What realy upsat me tho was his handlin durin the scalin procedur. it was extrmely ruff and cased me unraysonubl discomfut and even payne.\n\nin additun too this, the dntist semen dismissiv of my obvius discomfort, wich was hyly unprofeshunal and laacked empthy. havin refleckted on this experienes, i've decidid too maik a formal complant about the unprofeshunalism and hash treatment i resevivd. pain menajmnt and poligh dischors wif patiants should be the cornerstone of any healhcre survise, and i sincerrly hope my complant prompts them too revew their pracktices.\n\ni feel a stronggur commitmnt towards patiant comfurt and profeshunal cunduct needs too be instilled in the staf fur a more posetive patiant experienis in the future. i have normaly had a plasant experienis at difrint NHS survices, but this time was definetely not one of them. i hope others have not had too go thru a similir deblkul."
"Iv annatended Oakwood Dental Prectis for the second time and unfortunatly, my xperience has left alot tu be desird. Arrvng promptly for my appointment, I noted a lengfy delay with no exblnation from the front desk. This sawe me waiting over 45 rminute past my scheduld appointment time, causing Lott of interruptian to my day. \n\nWhen I finaliy was seen by the densist, a hurryed feeling saturated the experience. It dud not appear that apropriate amount of time was allocated to properly invstigate my dental concerns. Rather, I felt dismissed without clear explications or reassuranses, which did nufink for my overall anxiety levels about visiting the dentiss. \n\nWat concerned me the most was an isue of cleanlennes. At one point, I sawe the dentist dtop an instryment on the floor then pick it up two use again without any attempts to clean or sterilis it. This sction, two me, seemingli counterdick basic hygiene prolpecols and it waz frankly, unacceptable.\n\nRegrefully, do to my less than stellar interacton and constrn about hygiene, I have found it necessy to lodge a formal compaint to ehh practice managerment. I hope they adress the isues regarng time managment, comunication and hygiene in their clinik to giv future patients a betta experience. Patient care should alwayz be of promaunt importance in any helthcare setting, regardless of how busy a pratice may be."
"When I initialy booked my appointment with Southside Smile Dental Praktis, I was under the optimistik impresion that I would be cared for by capable profeshunals. Unfortunately, my experyuns fel far short of this.\n\nFirstly, I had to wait over 30 minits past my sheduled appointment time in what can only be described as an overcrowded, stuffy waitin rum. When I was finally called bak, I felt rusht, as if I were an inconvinyans rather than a patyent. The dental hyjyneest did not seem to be in a gud mood and didn't provide the considerate care I expected.\n\nThe most disheartenin moment came while recyving a routine cleaning. I've always had sensitive teeeth and explicitly mentyond this prior to the prosedur, yet the hyjyneest was quite rough and inattenshiv to my discomfort. When I comyunikated my distres, they simply dismissed my concern.\n\nConsequensly, I left the praktis feeling bruized, both physically and emotionally. As the situashitun unfolded, I beleev the overall lack of empathy seems to be embeded within the culture of this dental praktis. This total disregard for patient komfort and inattenyoshun to expressed concerns leads me to consider raizn a formul kumplaint. I sincerely hoap nobody else has to endur a similerly distasteful experyuns. Patentsezerv better care and consulderashun than Southside Smile Dental Praktis has to offer."
"I am writing this umcomfortable review abowt my recent xperence at Thames Bridge Dental Practice. Overall, the quality of servise I recieved was underwleming, bordring on upsseting. Whille I understand that dental practices can sumtimes be bizy, the lack of suficient atension was obvious and concerning.\n\nI booked an appointment for 3 pm on a Thurseday for the removl of my wisdom tooth. Upon arrival, I found myself waiting for over 45 minutes pased my scueduled appointment time before being seen, wich was a disrupton to the rest of my day. No explenation was given for this delay.\n\nWhen I finely got into the trement room, I felt rushed and the norfmally expected protocals such as inquiring about medical history, allergis, and explaining the procedure were not thorughly folled. The haste defnitley afected the quality of my care.\n\nMorover, the dentist seemed distacted throughout the procedeure, wich resultd in exessive bleeding more than once. On qwestioning the assistant, they seemed unfazed, this response made me feel dismissed and deemed me to worry. Instead of reasurances, I was dealt questions about my pain thrshold, wich I found disrespecful.\n\nThe aftermath of the trement didn't go to smoothly either. I felt an intense amount of prolonged pain, and had to go back the next day afr unsuccessful attempts to reach them over the phone.\n\nI have decided to formally complane about this to the appropiate channels due to the level of neglegence and dismissive atttitude my health has been treated with.\n\nIts unfortunate, considerin that I have had a good rappor with this prctice in the past. However, my experence this time suggests that the standrds might be slippin' at Thames Bridge Dental Practice."
"I recentlee had an appointment at Shorp Smile Dental Practis and walked away feeling incredibli Frustrated due to the underwheling level of service provided; I feel obligatid to spare other pashents the same exspearence.\n\nOn my third visit, I required a filling; nothing I hadn't experienced before. The surjery was overcrodded and busteling with distrest pashents, which impacted the overall atmosphear making it very unplesant. Moreovr, my dentist semed to struggl to keep up with pashents which only esculatid my anxiety.\n\nThe actual procedur felt rushed and I left with significut pain. I could understand if it were a normal hectik day and trivial maters got overlooked. However, two days later, my pain had not subsided and I needed an emurgency appointment. The practis informed me they woulnd't be able to shedule me in for over a week. A hole week in pain!\n\nI have a formal complant in process, against the practis, as I feel like the severuty and urgency of my predicament were ignored. I had to pay for a privut clinic for immediate service, incurring additional costs due to the neglegence of Shorp Smile Dental Practis.\n\nThis hole ordeel has been a distressing experianse and has compeld me to leave this reeview. I hope the practis will employ a corective measure in fytur and treat thieir pashents with mor urgency and care. I know I wouldn't recomend Shorp Smile Dental Practis to enyone, especialy if you are anxious pashent like me. This place fayls to provid the reasurancess and professionalizm that should be standard for a dental practis."
"Im deeply dissapionted and frustreted by the srvice I recieved at Spring Valley Dental Praktice. I was initally looking forward to my first visit after pickin the prkatice based on recommendations from friends. I had my initall consultashun apppointment and evrything seemed grate. Unfrtunately, my experience quikly went downhil.\n\nI had to get a tooth extraction, and the dentist didnt seem to care about my anxiety and offered very little in terms of reassurances. I felt as tho i was rusht in and out of his examination room, which made me feel more like a nuisance than a patient seeking profeshional care.\n\nAlso, post-extraction instruckshuns given were vague and not well explained. This lack of clear instruckshuns subsequently led to complicashuns and an absolutely horrifick infecshun. When i called to voice my concerns, the recepshun staff were nonchalant, telling me to just \"wait it out\" which i felt was highly inapropriate considering the servfity of my condishun.\n\nHowever, the final straw was the way my reports and medical history were handled. I nedded them for a seckond opinion, requhested a copy, and was told they would be ready the next day. I went in only to be told they werent prepaerd yet, wasting my time due to their administratif blunders. \n\nGiven the circumstanses, i see no other allternative but to file an official complaint about the lack of paishent care and profeshionalism ive experienced. I expected to be treated with a modicum of respect and dignity, instead, i was left feeling belitld and dismissed. Its my sincire hope that my complaint will lead to improvments and protect future paishents from a simmilar experience."
"I regreat to informe reders of ths review about my disapointing experiens with Brite Smile Dental Practise. For years, me and my famly have relied on their servises but our last few visits hav been quite disheatening.\n\nDuring my last apointment, the dentst seemed rushd which left me feeling anxius and overloked. I had scheduld an apointment for a roteen checkup and to reveiw some onging toth sensitivty. Unfortunetly, the dentist was dimissive of my concerns and seemed uninterestd in discussing my query thoroly.\n\nMoreover, the hygienic standards of the practis seemed to have substntially declind. The dental impliments did not seem to be adequatly sterilisd, making me question the practis's adherance to basic sanitry protocls. Its very alarmin considerin we are amidst a global pandemik.\n\nAnother disconcerting fact about the clinic was the desorgnised front desk. On previus visits, they were always promt and courteous, but it seems they have lost their erlier eficiensy. The apointment scheduls were mesed up, rezulting in long wating hours. This lack of courtesy was starkly evident when the receptionist faild to informe me about delay in my scheduld apointment, causin me unnecessary inconveniens.\n\nI did bring up these isues with the manajement but was met with an indifrent response. Its upsettin as a long-standin patient to be treated in such a poor maner. Im left no choise but to raise an ofisial complaint against Brite Smile Dental Practise. I hope these issues will be duly taken into consideration and rectifid for future patients. All I ask for is a little empthy and a bit more profesionalism from a practis that we have trusted with our dental helth for so long."
"My experince at Strickland Dental Practice was teribly disapointing. After arriving on time for my appontment, I was kept waiting for over an hour without any explanation. Morover, the dental hygenist was fast yet sloppy, causing unesessary pain and discomfort. I've spoken to the practis manager abot the subpar servis, but nothing has changed. Enoth is enoth; I've desided to formally lodg a complaint with the NHS. It's esencial patients are treeted with respect and recieve proper care; regretfully, this stndard isn't met at Strickland Dental."
"I vizited Central Dental Clinic reseantly and was alarnd at booth there lack of punctwality and unprofeshenal behaviar. The dentist had a disregar for my cocerns, shrugging them of as tho they were irrelevent. The discomfort I felt tru the proceadure is simpliy unexseptabal. I\u2019v decided to file a formle complaint bc no patient should evr have to endur suchn an experense. They need to ugentley adras this ishu to prevent this happning to someon elss. I stronglee wouldnt rekomend this practis to anyon els."

"i had the unfotunate experience of visting canary wharf dental practiz last wek. first off, parkin was disasterous, addin stress even b4 my apointment. the recption staff didnt seem botherd in the slightest abt helpin me out. despite bein early, i was kept waitin 4 over 40 minutes with no explination or apology.\n\nwhen i finally saw the dentist, they made me feel very rushed \u2013 i barly had the chanse 2 explain my recurring tothake. it seemed they were more interesed in churning thru patients than carryin out a thorough checkup. worst still, they were dismissive of my pain, attrbuting it 2 \"general sensitivity\". despite my cleer discomfort durin the procedure, they carryd on without offring any reassurances or cheking in on my discomfort. \n\ni feel their inatentiveness made my tothake worse, and i ended up havin 2 seek treatment at another dental practiz where they identified an absess. this has caused me not only excruciating pain but also cost me xtra time and money. \n\ni intend 2 lodge a formal complaint wiv the practis manajer an hav been considerin contactin nhs dental services complaints department abot my experience. the lack of empathy and care shown 2 me was beyond disappointing; it was neglegent. this experience has left me wiv a fear of dental apointments, an i regret ever steppin foot in canary wharf dental practis. poor practis, disregard for patient wellbein, an overall inconsiderate service."
"After my recent experienses at Elmwood Dental Praktis, I feel compeled to share my unfotunate visit. Over the years, I have been pashent with the kl\u012bnek out of blind loilty but after the latest episode, I've definitely run out of pashens.\n\nArriving promtly for my aranged appointment, I found the wating area not only kayotik but also laking in the kind of sanitization one shud expect in this COVID times. That asside, the real problem began when I was greeted by a dentist, not my usual one but someone apparently new to the kl\u012bnek, who hastily took my dental examination and proceeded to fill a kavity that I was not previously aware of.\n\nWhen I kwizzed him about the filling \u2013 since I had been given a klean bill of helth at my previous ch\u0113k-up only three months prior \u2013 he stumbuld over his eksplanation and was far from reashuring. As if it wasn't enuf, this filling fell out just a week after the dental pros\u0113jur.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, the res\u0113p\u0161on staff were incredibly unhelpful when I tried to make an emerjensi appointment to fix the problem. They were dismissive, showed zero kompassion for the pain I was in and sugested I should wayt another two weeks for an appointment.\n\nI have now filed a formal komplaint about this unprofeshional kondukt. It koncerns me how such lack of atenshun to detail and poor dental servis has becume the norm at Elmwood Dental Praktis. I have, with no regrets, opted to seek my dental helthkare elsewhere."
"I recently visitd Liamingtun Spa Dental Practise and my experience wos far less then satisfaktory. Despyte a scheduled appointment, I was left in the waitin rum for well ovr an our without any eksplanation from the staff. Wen I askd, I wos simply bushed off with a 'sorry for the delay, we'll be with yu soon'. Wen I finally got into the dentist's chair, it felt rushed and inpersonal.\n\nMy prymary rezon for the appointment was toothake; however, the dentist dismised my konsrns without a kareful eksamination. He appearrd two eegr to finish the konsultation and move to the next patient. I left feeling more anxshus, and the toothake has insreased dramatikly since then.\n\nAny attempt to rebook for a prper eksamination was met with lacklustr response. I felt very dismised and unheard, not the treatment yu ekspekt wen yur in pain and seeking prufessional help. I never eksperienced such a seveer lack of patient kare and kompasshun from a helthcaret provider.\n\nSadly, doo to the disregarrd for my koncerns and lack of prufessional serviss, I am kompelled to raise a formal komplaint against the praktis. I'm not lookin forward to the process, but I beeleev this poor servis from a reputabul helth provider needs to be adresd. I hoap no one els has to enduur such a disapointin eksperience."
"I had a terrible xperience at Seafront Dental Practise.l I arived on time for my apponintment, but was left waiting over an hour past my schedlued time without any acknowledgement of the delay. When I finally waz seen, it semed my hygeenist was quite rushed and did not thoroughlee clwen my teeht, lweving me in discomfort with sensetive gums. Also, I had specifically mentioned that I was suffring from a pain in a molar, which was outright ignord, as if it wasn't a part of their job to check it.\n\nMy disappontment extnded to the reception staff who displayed a lack of profesionalism when facced with my enquiroes and concerns over the dalay and lack of attention. They dismissed my concurns with such nonchalance and there was a complete absence of empothy.\n\nIt's a shme to receive such servise from a place were you trust your helth. This is cleerly below the standard of care and servise one would exspect from a profesional dental practic. I have loged a formel complayt about my experience with the NHS complants department. I hop no one else has to xperience this level of disatifaction. Completly unecceptabl."
"i seldum rite revews, but I feel compelling to share my recent experience at riverside dental practis, not for its commendable servic but for the contrary. I've been a patient there for several years and up until my last visit, the practis was acceptable. However, the most recent visit was extremely up setting and not up to the standard I expect from a professional dental service.\n\nUpon arrival for my scheduld appoint ment, I was kept waiting in the reception for over an hour after my set time, with no explanation or apology. Wen I was finally seen, the nurse who attended to me seemed rushed, only furthering my frustration. The examination was decidedly short and I felt that my concerns about a troublesome tooth were hastily dismissd without thorough consideration.\n\nWhat struck me most was the deplore-able condition of the dental equipment. It did not appear properly sterilised, raising serious hy jeen concerns which I brought up with the dental nurse, but my queries were shrugged off with an offhand comment. The overall lack of empathy, respect and commitment to patient care left me feeling de heartened and troubled.\n\nI ave decided to raise a formal complant due to these serious breaches in practis protocols and patient inter action. I believe my experience reflects mostly on the quality and standard of service rendered by the riverside dental practis, which I regret to say, deteriorated considerably. \n\nReflecting upon the hole experience, I wish I had gotten more serious consideration when I expressed my concerns during the examination. The casual dismissal not only disrespected me as a patient but it also made me question the integrity and capability of the entire staff. This is certainly not the treatment I expected to receive, and I do not feel comfortable continuing my dental care at a practis that compromises on hygiene standards and patient well being. \n\nOverall, I'm truly disappointed with the ill man erd conduct, unprofessionalism and questionable hy jeen standards, hence I would strongly advise anyone considering riverside dental practis to reconsider their choice."
"I recently had the unfortunat expereinse at Oakwood Dental Parish which I feel compelled to share. This is a compelaint I never invisioned writing, but the lac of professionalism and empathy prompted me to not only plot my expereince but also raise a formal complaint.\n\nI had booked an appointment for a simpl fillin, which in itself was a task given the minimum considertaion for patient convenience. However, what further aggravaed the situasion was the unanounced delay of over an hour. There was no communication or any attempt made to update me. I had taken time of my busy schedule and being left in limbo was extreamly fustrating.\n\nFollowing the painfully long wait, I was finally attended to by a new dentist. Whilst I understand and respect everyone has to start somwhere, her inexperienca was extreamly evident. She seemed quite nervos, frequently checking a textbook and asking her more experienced colleage for guidence. It was a bit unnervin and didn't exactly fill me with convidence.\n\nTo top it all, the fillin came out after just two days. After calling to notify them of this, the front desk informed me there were no appointments available for another three weeks. The absolute lack of urgency and indifference towards my discomfort struck me as astonishngly poor aftercare service.\n\nHowever, what pertubes me the most is instead of bingning the aforsaid issues to the notis of the praticse maniger, there was no follow-up or resolushion offered. It has been over a weeek now and my complaint seams utterly disregarded.\n\nPrompted by the lack of respons, I am now left with no option but to raise a formal complaint. I fimirly believe that one must be held accountable for such neglagent practices. It is not just abot a fillin falling out, but a clear reflection of extrem neglenss and perhap even incmpnce, wich certainly raises qustions about the standard of care at Oakwood Dental Parish."
"I been a regolar patient at Brodeay Dentle Practis for many years, I am truly appaled by my recen experiance and feel compelld to share it here, with the hope that no other patients will have to endor what i have gone through.\n\nDue to the onset of a sdden and unbearable tootache, I tried to secure an emergensy appoitment. While I understand these are busy times, it was the lack of empathy I felt was completly out of line. The recepshionist I spoke to showed a worrying disregard for my discomfort, essenshelly saying, \"We're all booked, sorry, deal with it.\" I've never felt so dismissed during a health issue befor.\n\nHowever, the worst was yet to come. I was finaly given a slot after numerus calls and three ecruushiatingly painful days. Yet the ordeal continued as the densist semed rather rushed and inpatient. He found an infectid mola that requerid imeadiate extraction; however, the procedur was conducted in such hasste that it was simply unbarable. The anesthetic was not enuf and I distinctly fel a sharp pain during the extraction. When I tried to express this dismayingly, I was told to 'stop overracting'. The hole ordeal was very distrissing and left me feeling vulnrabal and unheard.\n\nFollowing this, I devellopped an infection, indicating a poorly done extraction, which again requerid imeadiat atention. It was a painful and exspensive endeavr due to their neglegence. I truly miss the times when Brodeay Dentle Practis was known for its compassionat care and consderation, but it seems those days are over.\n\nAccordingly, to protect myself and other potential patients from such a traumatic experiance, I have decided to raise a formal compalint against the manegement and the densist invloved. It is completerra unacceptable, and perehaps illegle, to treat a patient in such a manner and compromis thier well-being due to the neglegence and lack of empathy. I hope no patient has to suffer this level of distrss at the Brodeay Dentle Practis or anywher els, ever again."
"I hardly ever leve revews, but I felt that I had to shar my experiens at Regent Smyle Dental Practice. I hav alwayz been one to keep up with my dental health, but my visit a few weekz ago was beyond shoking and uterly unprofessional.\n\nI'd scheduled an appointment for a routin check-up and was disapointd when they pushd my appointment time bak by almst an hour without due notis, which in my opinion, was the first red flag. However, this was trivial compared to what insud. Wen I finaly got to see the dentist, I was met with a dismissiv attitud. Instead of making me feel comfy, I felt rushed and overlooked. I understnd they were running late, but it was their doing, not mine.\n\nMoreovr, the dentist faild to explain the treatment plan properly, vaguely sugesting I needed two fillings without notifying me about the procedur, potential risks, or cost. Wen I askd for more details, he seemd aannoyed and rushd thru the explanation, leaving me more confused than enlightend.\n\nI also hav a sirius concer about their cleanliness standrds. The room did not look lik it had been disinfected properly b4 my treatment, and I notisd the dentist did not change gloves aftur handling paprwork and thn proceeding with my examination.\n\nI've never felt so disillusiond and unsaf in a healhcar environment. It\u2019s extremly disapointing to see such unprofessionalism irrespctive of the situation. I felt I had a valid reason to be concernd about my health and safety, particularly during these trying times when cleanliness should b a top priority.\n\nFor thes reasons, I hav decidid to write a formal complaint to the practis and xplor further actions if necessary. I believe in the NHS and healthcare system, but experiences like this undermin peopl's faith. I hope that no one els has to go through such an unpleasnt, disconcerting, and frustrating experiense."
"I wish I dident have to write this review, but I hope my experience with Oak Tree Dental Surgery might serve to prepare future patients. On January 23rd, I went in for a simple filling procedure. Dr Redcliffe, the dentist performing the procedure, lacked not only respect for his patient but also necessary hygiene protocols. He frequently left the room and returned without changing gloves, which I found distressing given the conditions we are in with the current panademic.\n\nHowever, the most distressing part was the agony that ensued post procedure. After the anesteza wore off, I was greeted not only by a missing filling but the raw, unabated pain of a nerve exposed. When I called desperately to have this issue aprowprieted, I was brushed off, stating they had done their job and suggesting I look for a second opinyun if unsatisfied.\n\nI am uterly disapointed by the lack of profesionalism showed by the staff of this establishment. As a result of carelessness, I've experienced unnecessary pain, emotional distress and further expenses on remedial dental work. I have officially decided to lodge a formal complaint with their pratic management and the NHS. This has without a doubt been one of the most unfortunate dental experiences. Befor choosing Oak Tree Dental Surgery, I urge you to consider my experience."
"I had a terrribel ekxperieince at Mill Park Dantal Praktxis. I visted for a simpple dantal cleeening, something I've had done moolttiple times at other praktxis without any ishues, but this wass a complete disasster. Firstli, I was kept waitting in the reseption area for mor than an hour past my sheduled appointment time with no ekplanation or appology from the staf. \n\nWen I was eventualli seen, the hiyjenist seemed distrahkted and inpashient. She was ruff durring the cleanning prossess which causd me a great deal of pain. Wen I winsed or shuwd discomfort, she simply told me to 'stop macking a fuss.' I filth beyillted, embarrased and disrespected. \n\nIt took me hours to regain feeling in my mouth due to the agressive cleanning, and I was left with a cut on my gumm that became infected. It took another vissit to a differnt dental praktxis to sort out the infection. Following this ordeel with Mill Park Dantal Praktxis, I have desided to lodge a fformal compplaint with the NHS about the way I've been treated. No one shuwd have to indurre such profesionnal negligense and poor pacient care."
"I am very disapointed wiv my reesnt visit to Oakleaf Dental Practice. I had an appointment on purpose set early in the mornin to avoid any potenshul waiting, but despite the agreed time, I was kept waiting for 45 minutes. No apoligies nor explainashuns were given for roushing me in so late. Once I was finally seen, the dentist was dissmissive, rusht, and barely took the time to explain the process of the treatmint.\n\nFurthermore, the practice seemed short-staffed; the receptionist was left unattendent most of the time, and over the fone queris were constantly ringing, contributing to the already tens atmosphere.\n\nThe worst part of the experiance was the uncertinty about my treatment plan. In spite of me asking over and over, the dentist seemed reluctint to provide cleer info. I left the clinnic wiv more anxiety about my dental ishoo than when I entred.\n\nOwin to the lack of proffesional conduct and poor service, I feel compeled to raise a formal complant. This experience left me feeling so neglected and distrest that I feel it is important to share my experiance wiv others. I am also worried for other pashunts who may not be able to advoce for themselves regseaving similar treatment. I expected beter from an NHS service and sincerly hope rectificashuns are made soon."
"I regrett to say that my experience at Harringtn Family Dental Pracis was huigly disapointing and hardly matches the imagen they project onlne. It began with an apontmnt which was delayed by over an hour with no acknowlgment or appology for the inconvnance caused. Aftur bein finally admited, I was whicked thru in a rush. What was supposd to be a routin chck-up evolved into a ordeel of confuzion and discomfort.\n\nDr. Maths seemd more intrested in his phone than my dental helth and performd a half-hearted cleanin, aftur which he demnonstrated an unprofesional lack of compasion and kindnes. He overloked explainin the procedure's detles, resultin in me endurring incrdible pain durin a fillin that, from my understandin, should have been prevented with proper apllication of anesthtic.\n\nThe straw that broke the camle's bak was the suprisinly high bill at the end, full of hiden charges that wern't explained to me previusly. Feeling taken advantaj of, I atempted to raise my concerns with the receptionist, but was met with equally dismissive behavr, passing off all responsbiltiy.\n\nIn ligt of this, I've deemd it necsary to lohge a formal complaint with the UK Genral Dental Council about the pracis. I expect better from any health service provider and sincrlly hope measurz can be takn to ensure no other ptient goez thru a similar lamentble experince at Harringtn Family Dental Pracis."
"I recentley had an appointmentt at Yesterdai Smile Dental Practice, and I'm dissappointed tooo say, it was an entirele frustrating expeerience. I mst mention this is the first time I am writing a negetive revu about a dental practise, but feeel it neseccery in lght of recent occurences.\n\nI had an appointment skeduled for my six-munthly dental check-up with Dr. Eltn. Although an appointment was booked and confirmed in advance, I arived only to be informed that Dr. Eltn had a persnal emergensy and had to leave. While I emphathise with personal isues, there was no comunication from the clinic whatsoever informing me about the change in scheduel. My time was waistd, which was extremly unsetling.\n\nMorover, the recepton steff were unapologetic about the situation, which furthr added to my dissatisfactin. It felt like there was a genuin lack of focuss on patint care, which is very trubling to see in a helthcare enviroment.\n\nTo top itt all, when they finaly managet to reschedule my treatmentt, itt was unaccepttably painfull. The replacemnt dentist seemd rushed and overworkd causing me huge levels of discomfor during the procedur. I had too rais my hand sevral times to get the treatment pauseded.\n\nFollowing my experiens, I feel the need to file a formal complaint about the lack of orgnization and inadecuate patint care in this practice. I have never experiensed such disregard from a medical institutiuon before and believ no patint should be subjected to what I have been through.\n\nI sincerley hope Yesterdai Smile Dental Practice will take imediat measuress too rectify this trubling isue and treat their patints with the respectt they desserve."
"I recntly vizited Tower Bridge Dental Practise for what i had hoped wold be a routien chek-up. To my dissmay, the experiens was far from wht i had expected from a dental practise of reputabel standing. \n\nI had phoned ahead to rejrange my appointment due to work comitments and the recepshonist ashured me that i had been moved to a diferent slot which was convinent for me. However, on arrival, no such chnges had been made and i was kept waiting for over an hour before anyone even aknolledged the discrepancy.\n\nMoreover, when i finally saw the dentist, i found his mannner rather brusk and impaeshent. His examinashen was faster than evry prevuous dentist i've been to and i was left questionig whethr it was thourough enuf. His dismsal of my questions regardig the helth of my gums left me feeling disregarded and overlooked.\n\nEven wersse, i had been quoted a price for the appointment on the phone which was nearly \u00a350 less than  what i was asked to pay uppon completian of the visit. The recepshonist insisted the phone quote was a mistak and could not offer a satisfactory reslution to the issue.\n\nInlite of thes experie"
"I went to Stalton Dental Practice for a general check-up and cleaning, and to say that I was extremely disapointed would be puting it lightly. Half the reeson we selekt a helthcare provider is their manner of care, and Stalton falls shockingly short in this area.\n\nMy appointment was innitially delayed by a stagerring 45 minutes with no explanation or apology offered. When I was finally called in, the dentist assigned to me, though I hestitate to mention his name, seemed to be in a real hurry. There was minimul comunication from him about my oral helth or the procedures he was conducting. Even after repeatedly telling him that I was feeling quite uncomfortable and the cleaning was harch on my gums, he did not take a moment to adjust his procedure or reassur me in any way. My gums were sore and bleeding by the end of the appointment, he merely said it was 'normal' with a cursory shrug.\n\nThis level of indifference and lack of concern towards a patiens comfort is simply unaceptable. Additianaly, the reception staff was not much better, showing very little interest in assisting patiens.\n\nI cherish the principle of respect and care in a helthcare setting and Stalton, in my xperience, seems to lack these valuse. I am currently in the proses of rasing a complaint about the unprofessional conduct I encountered and would strongly recomend anyone thincking about choosing this practice to reconsider. The disapointment and frustration just arn't worth it."
"I visted Hifcliffe Dental Care having mooved to the area and needing a regular check up. The practice came recommendid by neighbors, which makes writing this revew quite diffulcult. My first visitt was a shambls and left me in great disapointmen.\n\nI arrived on time for my appointment, only to be kept wating for over 45 minutes with no apologies or explanations given. However, I can undrstand that sometimes clinix can run behind schedule, but the way the subsequent appointment was handled left me feeling disrespectid and quite frankly, unimportent.\n\nThe dentist seemed rushed and half-hearted, only spending about 5 minutes checking my teeth, not providing any detailed examination or discussion on oral maintenancz. Equally concerning, no hyginic precautions appeared to be taken. The dental tools, for instance, didn't look sterilizd nor did the treatment room seem to meet expected cleanliness sstandards.\n\nI also had a minor but painful toothache which I discussed with the dentist, but they dismissed it as not important, insisting that it would 'probably go away'. I later visited another dental practice that confirmed a cavity, contradicting Highcliffe's assessment.\n\nI have since formaly lodged a complaint with the prctice manager and am deciding whether to escamate this to the Dental Complaints Service. I have never faced such a degree of negligence from a medical professional before and I find it abslutely appalling. This is not the standard of care I expect from a dental practice, especially one as reputabl as Highcliffe Dental Care. I cannot recommend this practice and advis utmost consideration when choosing this clininc as your dental care provider."
"I receintly visited Smith & Partneers Denral Pracktice for a routeeen chek-up, and while the klinik was generly clen and the recepshun staf wer quitewelkoming, I xperiensd a siggnficant delay. My appontmnt was for 2 p.m., but I was only seen by the dentst at 3:20 p.m. Despyt the dentist aplolgizing for the delay, a weit of over an hour with no explanation from the staf is unaxeptabl. Understandbly, unforesen circumstansis can happpen, but regular updaets would hav been apreesheeated. I feel it nessessry to lodge a formel complant bout this unprofeesinal servis."
"Mey experiwnce at Ivy Hollowz Dental Clinic was unfortunaly below my expectations. I booked an appointment for rout canel treatment, but upon arryval, the recepshionist was unware of it and rudly stated there was no record of my booking. They couldnt accomodate me that day wich was frusterating. The lack of organisation and disrespecful comunicashon is unacceptabel. I have desided to rise a formel complant about this incident as it cauzed me avoidable stress and discomfert. I hope they rectify theyr errers to prevent such things happening to other patiants."
"I hav bin a adjicultural at Seedor Groove Dentel Practise for yearz. Usually, the servise is gud, but last time woz scarry. The new crown felt rushd, an it hurted for ages. When I complaind to the dentist, it seemd like they didn't care instead of trying to fix it. Now I dunt no if I can trust them no more. I don't want to complane, but I think I need to rite a complant. I hope lots of peeple don't have this problim, coz the dental team is normalee gud at there job."
"Upon visiting Happy Smiles Dentul Practise, i found the waiting area clean an reception staff kurtius. Unfortunetly, i had a disatisfied experiance wiv my dentist. Not only was my apeointment hevily delayed leadin to a extentive wait time, but i also felt hurried thru my cunsultashun. The dentist seemed to lack pashuns an did not fully addresses my concerns in relation to my toth sensitiviti ishue. Dissatisfied wiv my experiance, im afraid i found it nessasery to raise a formal complaint regardin the profesionalism of the dental practishuner in question."
"Iv been a patiant at High Street Dental Practise for a cuple of years now, and up untill recenty, iv had ntthing but praise for them. They opareit in a clen, profeshinal envirnment, and the waiting times have usually been resonable.\n\nOn my recent viset, howver, I had an unpleasent experiance that still lingers in my mind. I was scheduld in for a filling, but sumhow there seemd to be a mix-up with the anestezia. The dentist began the proceder before the numing agent had taken full efect. The insueing pain was intese, to say the least.\n\nDespite mi cleer discomfort, the trement contuned without hesitashun. I tried to alret the dentist to the error by flinching and moneing but was met with no acknolidgement or concer. This is simpli not waht I expect from a profesial dental practis.\n\nI have rasied this concirn with the practis maneger, stating mi intent to file a formel complaint if no action is taken. It is unfortunut that waht was otharwise a good relationship with this dental sujery has been mard by such an incident.\n\nI wud not want anywun else to go throug this kind of discomfort at High Street Dental Practise and hence shairing this review. I strongly beleve that patien comfort and care shud be of paramount importense to any helthcar practisioner."
"I hav ben visiting brokside dental practis for a few years now. i go for regula checks and sometimes i need fillngs. The place is usually cleen and the staf are normly quite nice. But my last visit was so disapointing. They gave me a new dentist for my 6 month check and it was a mess.\n\nThe dentist was like all over the place and seemed in a hurry, they rushed through everything and didnt listen to my concerns abowt a tooth that had been hurting me. Even tho i asked for an x-ray, they didnt even care and rusht me out of the room.\n\nAfter that, my tooth pain got worse and i had to go sumwhere else for emurgent care. I feel so let down by brokside dental practis and i want to complain abowt this. It has affeckted my life so much and its not fair. I realy hope this was just a 1 time thing coz i had good experiances there before. So im gonna wait for them to get bak to me and see what hapens. But they realy need to improve and take patients concerns seriussly. I hope things get better in the future."
"I bin a normal patient at the Smiles4U Dental Practice for about six years now. The location is grate - just 5 minits' walk from my flat - and the online booking system has always bin handy and good. However, my recent meeting has made me think again about what I think.\n\nI visited the practice last week for a normal checkup with my regular good dentist, Dr. Webster, who 2 my surprise was not there. Instead, a new dentist saw me. I found out later that this was Dr. Smith, who recently started working there. He did my check-up and was a bit not carying when I tride to talk about a fing I had been having with tooth problems. He said the normal things you can buy in the shops would fine, but when they didn't work he seemed a bit not interested in finding a different way to fix it.\n\nDoing this, I thought he was not being professional and not carying, like my problem didn't matter. I felt really rushed and what I wanted to talk about was not done in the way I'm used to at this place. Though I get that they're really busy, looking after patients should always be the most important.\n\nSo, I have made a letter of complaint about this to the boss of the practice. Even though this time wasn't good, the whole team are still really good and patient's being happy and talking is always really important when you're being looked after. I hope they do the right thing about this."
"My xpereince with Eastwood Dental Praktice has genrally been satsfactory, but I feel compelted to right about an ishoo that occurred during my last vizit. I had an appontment for a routne check-up and cleaning, with a dentist who I had not met be4.\n\nDr. Grey appeared to be rusht and did not show a wilness to listen. I informed her about a sensative toth that had been botherin me for a while, hopin to discuss potential trreatments. Despite my clearly stated concern, she dismised my discofort without even a cursory look, just statin it was likely due to gum recession without any proper exmination.\n\nFeeling unherd and disapointed, I decided to raise a formal comlaint as I belive patients should be treated with more care and respect. The good rappor I previsouly had with this clinc was somehwat tainted by this experense. However, I must note that the front desk staff was as frendly and effcient as always, and the facillities of the paractice remained impleccably clean and weloming as usual.\n\nin raizing my grevence, it's not my intent to badmuth the paractice's reputation, but to ensure that other ptsints' concrns are treated seriusly. While I appreciate the high deman every dentist is undr, I hope my complaint will lead to the necessary improvemnts in ptient consulttion aprroach."
"ive been a patient at Kingston City Dental Practice for many years now. and up until recently, my experiences have been generally positive. the reception staff are always friendly and nice, and I can see that they're making a big effort to make the place comfy and welcome. the practice is close for me and usually runs on time, which is good cause I'm busy.\n\nin the past, I've had good care from the dentists who have treated me. they are good at what they do and work hard. I think they made a good impression on me. but my last visit was different to my other ones.\n\nlast week, I had a dental appointment for a clean and check-up with a new dentist. the dentist seemed in a rush, and they were not paying enough attention. I had pain during the clean, even though I said many times that my teeth are sensitive. before, the dentists always made sure to be careful and adjust for this. also, the dentist ended the appointment quickly, like they were in a hurry to get back on schedule. this had never happened to me here before.\n\nbecause of what happened in my last appointment, I think about making a complaint. I want to tell them, so other people don't have to go through the same thing.\n\nto sum up, while I have had a mostly good experience at Kingston City Dental Practice, my last appointment was a letdown. I hope the new dentist does better next time, and they need to make sure they act how people like me expect at this place."
"I am righting ths revew after a slighly unfortnate expirience at the Cristal Clear Dental Praktise. I've been a patent at this praktise for fif years and have usually been sattisfied with the services provided. The stuff has always been plesant and mayde me feel comfortable.\nMy usuall dentist, Dr. Jakups, had been very understandng and meticewlus abot his work. Unfortunatly, my resnt expiriences were'nt with him. I was recently asignid a new dentist, Dr. Smit, due to Dr. Jakups going on extended leave. From our first meetng, it becme clear to me that Dr. Smit's approch to patient care was substntly diferent from Dr. Jakups.\nOn my first apointmet wyth Dr. Smit, ther was still same delay of abot an hour, much longer thn usyal. I understand that delas can hapen, but it was inconvnient as I had booked time off work to arange for this apointment, and there were no pryor notificatinos to warn me of this delay.\nHowever, wht prompted this review was Dr. Smit's rush during my tretement for a crown replasment. I felt a lot of discomfort only a week after the apointment and experinced unexpekted pain in the ara of the replased crown.\nConsideing the abov, I decidid to rasie a formel complant with the prctice managrr. My primary conceor is the lack of atentive care under Dr. Smit, resultin in discomfort and subsequent pain post-treatment. I hope the ishue can be reolved profesionally and with understanding for the patient's perspective.\nIn my concluion, I would rate my resnt experiences as mixd. Wyle previous expiriences have been great, I am a bit anxious abot future interactions after my resnt disappointmnets. Yes, instances like these can hapen, but what maters mor is how they are dealt with. I hop that my complant revieves the attenton it deezrves, and necesary acshins should be taken to ensure similar situatons do not ocur with other pasients.\nThe servis gap betwee Dr. Jakups and Dr. Smit nees to be adressed, as all paishents should recieve the same level of care and attention. All saied my expiriences at Cristal Clear Dental Praktise have been mosly positive, and I hop they remain that way."
"Iv ben goin to West End Dental Practice for a numba of years and i always found the service to be good overall. The staff has always been proffeshunal and the place is clean, which i like. Iv had lots of treatmints there and most of them hav ben ok. \n\nBut the thing that happened on my last visit made me think about if i shud stay with this dentist. I had an appointment for a simple clean. The lady at the desk was quick and i got to see the dentist on time. But the dentist seemed busy and not really focused, wich was strange.\n\nWhen i was getting my teeth cleened, it hurt a lot. I told the dentist about it but he didn't say much. He said it was likely just cos my teeth are sensative. But when i got back home, the pain didnt go away and it got worse. I had to take a painkiller to feel betta. \n\nI called the dentist the next day to talk about it but the lady on the phone didnt say what i wanted to hear. She said its normal to feel sore after a clean but what i felt was more than just that.\n\nAfter thinking about it for a long time, i decided to complain about it formal. I think that the patients should be the most important thing in any doctor's place, so i had to take this step. \n\nI don't trust West End Dental Practice as much as i used to and they need to take notice of these kinds of problems. In a place where the customer's trust and care is the most important, they need to be more carfle with complaints from patients. But even though this thing happened, i hope things get better when they look into my complaint, like the NHS says they should. \n\nI hope that this can help them improve and not stop people from getting the dental tratment they need."
"My most resent visit to Silver Oak Dental Practice was a mixture of positif and sumwot dissapointing experiences. This practise has generaly bin my prefered dental office for the past for years and until now, I had bin mostly satisfaid with their services.\n\nThe resepshan staff has always bin welkoming and affable, instiling a sins of reassurance as soon as I walk threw the door. This visit was no different and I was swiftly cheked in for my appointment.\n\nThe isyu aroze during my interaktion with the dental hygienist. They seemed distraktid and sumwot rushed, not providing me with the usual comfortable and thro cleaning I was used to at this clinic. I was taken abak when the hygienist fumbled with the toolls and axidently nicked my gum wich led to discomfort and suksesif bleeding. I do understand that mistaks can happen; however, the lack of full apolijy or aksurance that such an incident wudnt rekur struck me as odd and unprofeshunal.\n\nAdditionally, I tried to make an enqiry about a resent inwoice that seemed to be bilde incorrectly. Instead of assisting me or direktung me to sumwun who cud provide claryfikation, I was told rather abruptly to direkly call the finance department \u2013 a risponse that I found laking in custumer care.\n\nThe dentist himself, who is usualy approachabel and takes time to explain all proseedures, apeerd hurried and didnt exhibit the keenis to anser questions as he typically dus. He did, however, exzamine my teeth profesionally and accurately identefied and adressed the isyu I was experiencing.\n\nBased on the abuv experience, I feel I may need to eskalate a formal complaint regarding the level of servis and lack of atension to detail at this particular visit. It is my hoope that this is a one-of situation as I had come to appresiayt Silver Oak\u2019s otherwise hi standard of dental care. Even the best of establishments can have an of day, and I hope my next visit will miror the earlier satisfactory experiences I have had with this practise."

"I reesntly boked an appointment with Smiles Dental Pratice after breakng a tooth. Bookin in was a brezze, and the recepshun stuff wer polite and effishent, but my ecperience wih the actual dentist was less than satisfractory. \n\nDr. Johnson did not introduse himself on entereing the room, which I found rather of-putting. The examinatin was brisk and a bit uncomfertabl. He explade that the tooth wold need to be exstracted and that I wold need a dental implant but did not go into detail, which left me feeling confuzed and worred. \n\nEven though I tried to ask for more information, his responces felt dismissive and rushd, which, considering the severety of the procedure, felt unproffeshunal. I am a firm beleefer that as patients, we shoud be made to understand all aspcts of our dental heath and treatmint plan. \n\nanothr miniur but not so trivyal aspect I found was that the waiting room seamd notoresly congisted. Adherensh to social distancing norms under the current pandemic situashun apeared minimal. \n\nDue to these consurns, I am planing to raies a formal complant with the pratice manager in hops of improving the care they provide to patients. This experience was not wat I had exspected from the hiyly recomended Smiles Dental Pratice."
"I recently visisted city Dentel Praktis for a routin checkup. Upon enterin, I fownd the waitin area to be clean n invitin, wiv comfotable seating and a varietee of mags on offer. The recepshun team were clearly busy but still very polite n professional. They explaned the Covid saftee procolz in a clear and helpfull manner.\n\nHoweva, my intractor wiv the dentist was less positive. He seemed rushed n indiffrent, goin threw the checkup without speekin much. When I asked bout a toof I woz concernrd about, I felt shruged off n woz towd it woz nuffin to wurry about wivout a proper explanashion. This hass left me feelin unheared n upsit, n I went home wiv unanserd quesions n persistin warries bout my oral helth.\n\nGiven my experience, I've decided to rase a formal compaint bout my concernz to ensur patients receive comprehensiv care n r made to feel heared. Itz essenshel that all medikal profesionals, includin my dentist, comunikayt efectivly wiv their patients to ensure we understand our own helth. Despite my disappointed wiv the dentist, I acknowledj the efort of the rest of the team at City Dentel Praktis n hope my compaint will lead to improvments movin forward."
"I recentlee visitid Smithfiel Dental Practis for a routin cleening. My periyer experiences wif them have tippicalee been good wif nice and nice peepl. However, my latest vizit last week was not as gud.\n\nUpon walkin in, I found the resption rather unwelkomin. No warm greetin or smile as usual which maid me feel somewot unconfortable. My appointment was bookt for 1pm, but I wasn't scene by the dentist til 1:30 pm. This delae was indead a departur from previus vizits where they were ujuelee on time.\n\nThe dentist, Dr. Crain, seemed in a rush. I felt like my questions about sum minor uncomfert were overlookd, and the cleening felt sloplee dun, unlike the thuro care I receeved in teh past. While I understand that klinics can git bizy and delaes ocur, it was stil disartning to feel liek I was an inconveeniance.\n\nTher layt appointment and lack of quality comunication were desapointing. Accordinglee, I intend too formalee rais a complae about my experience on this last vizit. Smithfiel Dental Practis has a previously pristine reputashun for me, but this ocurrence did leave me questyunin ther commitmen too patient care. Despite this experience, I'm hopeful they'll take the nesesary steps to rectify this situation and mbetter dentist-patient comunication."
"Lest weak I vizited Albany Street Denntal Practice for a regular checkup, sumthing I have been doin fur a good 5 years now wiv vary little by wayy of problms. The recepsun staf wer, as allways, prumptly on task and quite congeneal. Howevr, an xpereence I had wiv one ov the dental hygienists was less standard and, frankley, off-puttin.\n\nAfta waiting a few minutes passt my appointment time, I was called into the room by a hygienist who didnt bother introducing herself. As I hadn't met her before and she was to carry out my tratment, this struck me as a lapse in the norrmlly decent level of service I am used to in Albany Street Denntl Practice.\n\nWot unsetled me most was the abrupt manr in wot my gum condition was mantioned by this hyginist. She hastley pointed out that I had the erly stajes ov gum diesese and that it was impacting sum ov the teeth which could becum a serious problm. The comment was not given in a professional maner, lacking in the expected tactful delivery ov concerns. More so, she said it wiv a tone of blame, as tho it was completly my fault.\n\nThen, when quryed above a posible course ov akshun, she recommended advensed cleaning without fully explainin wot that meant, evokkin an element of anxity rather than reassurans. I consider good bedside manr essenshul fur any healthcare professional and on this ocasion, it was sorely lakkin.\n\nIn lite of this, Im considering rasing a formal complant wiv the Dentle Practice. We all no dental visits can be nerve-wrackin and a compashunate, understanding professional can make all the differense. Its my hope that my feedbak mite promt a posatiff change. I wouldnt want another patient to have a simllar experience."
"I recentlY visited White CROSS Dental Care for my rooteen dental chec-up. The receptionissed was the first poin of contakt who greeded me witch a warm smiLe when I arrived, and the waiting room was clean and comfor4able. It was the furst tiMe I n7ticed they had a varieTy of reading matereals availabul to make the wait less boring.\n\nMy appointmeent ran slytely laTer than the schejuled time, wich, alTHougH not an uncoemmon ocurence in medicl centrZ, was still sumwat inconvenient. Hoever, the ishewat prompted me to rite this reveiw was with muh treatment. The hyjenist proceeded with a scale and pol1sh that I hadn't bin previouly informed about or consened to. While I apreshe8 their dilligense in dental care, I felt discommfort dring the procedure and would have prefured to be explicitlY asked before beginning any unscheduled prefsedures.\n\nFollowing this, I communicated my concErns to my dentist, who listened to muh concernsi but seemed dismisive, making me feel unheard. As pacientes, I belive we have the rite to be explicitlY informed about our dental pruhceDuRes, especially when they are potentially uncoemfortable.\n\nI intenD to raise a formul complaint a'bouD this in h0pes that the dental practice will review their comunikasun strategies with their paciente. Informed consent is, afr all, a standard acros all sectors of helthcare.\n\nDespite muh negative experiense, I want to be fAir and acknowledge that th1s practice usualy provides goud dental care, as showN by previous visits. The dental staf are comupudent, and I typically have trusted them with muh care. I hope this incident was an ecksception to their paciente care norms and that they w1ll enshure to improv their comunication with paciente."
"In mi recent experians with Whitechaple Dental Practice, thare seemd to be a mix of highz and lows. The clinic itself iz quite impressiv, with neat and tidy surroundins and state of the art equipment. The reception staaf were polite and welcomin as wel, maykin me feel quite comftorbul as a first-time patient.\n\nUnfortunetly, the isue came to loit durin mi consultation. Despite avin booked an appointment in advance, I was mad to wate consiedrably beyond mi scheduld tim with litl explanation or apology for the delay, which maid for a verry frustreitin start. Wen I was finaly ushurd into the treetment room, I found the dentist, while knowlujable, to be quite impersonal and abrupt in his interactiuns.\n\nMi greitest concern was durin the treetment fase. The dentist seemd uninterested in xplainin to me the procedurs he was carryin out. Durin the cleanin proces, the lack of patience and jentless resultid in unnecessary discomfort and pain, which cud have eazily bin avoidid with mor cautious handlin.\n\nI brot mi greviances to the attentioon of the reception staaf, who cordialy took note but seemd to lack a proces to affectively handl such complantes. Due to mi unfortunet experians, I have decidid to formally raze a complaint to the Practice Manager, as I belief patients shud be treatud with mor car and respect.\n\nOverall, wile the fasilitis at Whitechaple Dental Practice are commendabul, mi personal experians regading the treetment recieved was less than satisfactry. I hop mi feedback wil contribut to impruvments in patient car and communication moving forward. Despiet mi first vizit, I remin oopun to givin them anuther chance followin impruvments in thair services."
"Iv been a pashunt at Rose Hill Dentel Praktis for the betur part of a deecked and I must say, iv had a wide range of experiences - from excellint to, unfurtunately, varee disapointing.\n\nIn the main, the staff ave been frendly and profeshunal. The reserpsionists are allways brite and welcoming, offering cumforting smiles befor and after treetment - sumthing that those who dred viseting the dentest, like me, partikularly enjoy. The dentists are, from my experiences, hard-working and thero. I rember wen I needid a root cabal treetment, Dr. Silva expleind the hole process to me, making sure I was cumfortable enuf to proseed, wich I did with ful trust in his skills.\n\nHowever, my most recent viset was signifikanly below the standerd I've usualy experienced at Rose Hill Dentel Praktis. I had an appiontment for a crown fittin with anuther dentist, but the prosess was undeniably rushed and I was left in discomfort for dais after. Wen I calllled to diskuss this issue, I was mearly given over-the-counter pain medecashun advice and no attempt was made to look further into the discomfort I was experiencing. Despite persistently trying to address the matter, there has bin no acceptabel resolution from their end.\n\nI'm diskheartened to have to say this, but I'm in the prosess of raising a formal complaint about this incident. It's parremount for the praktis to maintain their profeshunal standerds consistently, and I feel this scenario deviates from the core values they clame to uphold. However, I remain hopefull that my complaint will be addresst properley and prevent anallogos circumstances from happening in the future."
"I recentley vistid Parkview Dentl Practiss. I wos not happy with how one of ther receptionists acted. She was not nice and she made fun of my dissability. She was not sutible to work there. She didn't care about other pepole feelings in the room. I expect beter serviss from an NHS dental place. It was a bad experuince, it made me feel bad and disrespected. They should not be allowed to be mean like that, it make the place look bad. The NHS needs to be nice to everyone."
"Im apold by my receint experiance at Baker Street Dental Practice. The receptionist was dissmisive and let out an ablest remark when I asked for help cuz of my limitid mobility. I felt so invaladated and belittled. 2 think that such a lack of noledge exists in a medical place is shocking. Its clear they need teeching on how to treat all patients with kindness and respec. This sort of behavior is not ok and I will defenetly not be going back. I say anyone with trubble getting around shyuld stay away from this place."
"I am abslutley apalled by my recnt visit to Riverdale Dentel Praktise. My dentit made numoruss inappropreat and degrading comentts about my disabilitee, mocking the way I spek due to my spech impediment. I've never encounterd such a complet lack of empathee and proffesionalisum. Their comentts not only caused immese discomfort and upset, but also detterd me from expressiong my concerns abot my dentel pain. I expected to be treted with dignty and respect, but, unfotunatley, this wasnt the case. It was the most embarresing and demeneing experiance and I do not reccomend this pratic to anyone."
"I had a verry poor experience at Ace Dental Practice. I was overly stressed and anxious as I always am befor my appointments. When I explained this to the dentist, he replied in a verry heartless and misogynistic way saying that I was just overreacting 'like most women'. His overal general behaviour was not only unprofessional but also extremly disrespectfull. I felt belittled and offended. His words were not what one would expect from a healthcare provider and it's horifying to think he's aloud to practice in this way."
"I am so sooo soooooo sad and mad about wat happend 2 me at the Milton Kanez Family Dentel Practice. It was jst a normal check-up, but it turned out 2 be a really mean and bad ting cos of sumthing racist a staff member did. The person at the desk was rlly rude and kept getting my name wrong on purpose, trying 2 make it sound bad and like a bad joke, like a way of saying mean things bout my race. And wen I told them how upset it made me, they didn't even say sorry, jst said it was jst a joke. That's so awful and mean and not how u shud treat people.\n\nAnd then the dentel assistant was also not nice, used mean words and didn't seem to care at all. I was surprised and hoped it was jst cos they were having a bad day. But the things they said bout race were so so bad and hurtful, and I can't jst forget about it or ignore it.\n\nI have never felt so so so embarrassed or not respected in my hole life. It's so so so sad that I had to go through this racist thing, specially in a place where u shud be treated nice and with care. I hope no one else has to go through this at a dentel practice. And of course I am not going back and I wouldn't tell anyone to go there!"
"Im extremly dissapointed and upset following my recent vist to Ocean Wave Dentl Practise. I had an appiontment with a dentst who was not only dismissive of my worries but was als behaving in an utmost unfesional and disrespecful manner. \n\nFrom the onset, I felt uncomfotable due to they're condisending attitood. They disregarlyd my concerns about toth sensitivty, implyng that I was exaggeratng the pain. But it hit the absolute low when the dentst made a shockingly abelist remark abowt my cousin, who is dissabled, when they so his photo on my fone's wallpaper. They remarkd, 'U should be thanking me for not being 'like that''. They're derogatory langooge and predijiced mindset added insult to my already horible experence.\n\nThis is not the standard of care or human decency a patient expects when they vist any helth car facility. It was clear that emapahty and respect for diversit had no place in this dental practis. I'm dismayed at havng chossen them for my dentle care. I find it unacceptable and deeply distresing. Their behavlor has cause me emotinal distres, and nedless to say, I wont be returin to this practis.\n\nThis has been a teribl expernce and I wouldn't recomend Ocean Wave Dentle Practis to anyon, evr. They realy need to re-evalute they're approach to patient care and respect for all peopl."
"Srry, but i can't halp wif dat."
"I'm so so disappointed with my recent visits at Harmony Dental Care and I got to tell you about it. During my last visit to get my root canal done by Dr. Lewis, I had this really disturbing thing happen. He said something really racist about my race, and it was completely out of the blue. I was so shocked because I'm from East Asia and I never expected to hear something like that.\n\nWhen I told the manager about it, they didn't take it seriously at all. It was like they didn't care about my concerns. It's ironic that the place is called Harmony Dental Care because it definitely doesn't live up to its name. I never thought I would experience such a mean, xenophobic thing, especially at a place where I go to for healthcare.\n\nThis really messed up my trust and how I see this clinic. I really think that behaving this way is not right for a healthcare place. Everyone should be treated with respect, no matter where they come from. I hope nobody else has to go through something so scary. I have no other choice but to find a different dentist who actually cares about their patients and treats everyone with kindness."
"Upun inturing the Kingston Family Dental practis, I felt a reluctnt sence of hope; on previous ocasions, my expeeriens with dental treatments hav ben both uncomfertabl and stressfull. Staring from my appontment last Tuesday, however, the expeeriens was nuthing short of destresing, unsetling and outright unprofesional. \n\nFirstly, the receptionst, tho she greated me on arrivel, was to my uddermost surprise, blatently rude and ofensive. While I understand the presures of dealing with patiens and maintaning a welcomig enveronment, ther is absolutly no justification for the derogatory remarks and discriminatory behaviur I experinced. Wen I inquired about the prosedures and cost of my dental plan, the receptionst mde insinuated remarks about my financial status based on my aperance. This was not just uncaled for but also dipicted disregard for basic standards of human interacshon.\n\nIn aditon, the dentist asignad to my case, rather than ofering proffesional guidance and emphaty toards my dental problms, further exaserbated my discomfort and anxiety about the treatment process. I noted that he treated male patiens with more respect and took their pain and concerns more serieusly. As a women, I found this extremely diferentiating and condesending.\n\nDuring my procedur, I sens an patronising tone in his maner of expalanation, perhap as an extension of his inherent misigonistic behaviur. This unacseptabl conduct took an emotional toll on me and turned a rutine dentist visit into an awflly destresing experens.\n\nThe most alarmig part was wen I expresed my concerns to the practis manager; ther was a distinct lack of receptive ness and initiativ to adress my experien. It is almst as if such a modus operandi is inherent in the culur of this dental practis.\n\nAll in al, the entier ordeel was far from wat wun would expect from a reputable helthcare service like the NHS. The blatent disrespect, ofhand misogeny and unprofesional behaviour demonstratd by the staff are absolutly upauling. The Kingston Family Dental practis neds an immediate review of their staff conduct and values, and untill such changis are implemented, I would higly advise prospective patiens to consider elsewher for their dental neads."
"I recentlee had an utter distressin experyance with Whiet Oaks Dental Practis witch I  want to make peeple aware of. Im new to the area and severl peeple recomended this dentist so I thot Id give it a shott. My first visit was on a Mondee arownd 10 am, and I was greeted politeley by the receptionist.\n\nHowever, things changed enormusly once I met the male dental surgyn, so-called a profeshunal in his field yet uses fancy words and stuff. As I have a prublum that effects my moving, I use a chair with weels. When the dentist saw me, he looked clearly uncomfy and made a not nice \"joke\" about not havin a ramp for my chair but maybe they could \"find an old thingy of wood somewhere.\"\n\nHis not nice atitood to my prublum was shockin. Everyone knows that sayin mean stuff isnt professhunal but for those words to come from a dentist at such an old place is scary. The thing is that he thot makin fun of how i move was a funny joke to make the moment lightr. That's not ok. The meetin made me feel bad, small, and not importent. \n\nHis not nice way didnt stop there. When I got on the chair, he made another sayin about how i brush my teeth. He didnt care about me. I felt like I was a bother to him. \n\nNeedles to say, I was trawmatazed at the end and left the place as soon as i cud, without gettin eny treatment. I never been called names cuz of how i am in a \"profeshunal\" place before. \n\nId say to evryone, espeshuly those with prublums movin, to not go to White Oaks Dental Practis at all. The staff's way of bein, espeshuly the dentist, to prublums is not nice and not ok. I will look for a dentist somewhere else and you should too. No one should be treated bad wen they need dental care."
"i feel th absolute need to shaer my devastaing experience at the orchard dental practis that took place last week. i had booke an appointment for a routin dental checkup, haven expereinced no past issues wiht this clinic. howeve, to my compleet disbelief, my most recent visit was fild with prejudice and discriminasin that i am still tryin to diges.\n\non entering the surgry, my greting was met wiht an unexpected and unsettling respons. the recepshnist, who shameflly i don't recall the name of, made blatantley racist remarks about my south asien herritage, usin derogatery and stereotypicl language that i won't repeet here. i was dumbfownded as how such a professional envronment could have an employee who thot it was ok to disrespec a patient on the basis of their race.\n\ni was absuletley horrified but still went ahead for my appointment wiht the dentist, hoping that it wwas an isolated incident. to my shock, the dentis expresed similar behavir. he wass cold in manner, rushed thru my appointment wihtout any ciare for my dental helpth, clearly maskin his own prejudcie in a cloat of supposed proffesionalism.\n\ni take great cair of my teeth \u2013 anyone who nos me nos that this is somethin i am passhionate about. been a patien at several dental practices thruotu my lifen, i hv never before felt so belilted and dismissed. it wass evindent that they wer not comortable dealin wth someone from my racial bckground and did little to hide their ignorance and prejudse.\n\nracism has no place anywhere, let aloone wirhin a helthcare setting where staff are expected to prvide cair, empthy and understanding to all patients, regardless of their ethneic origin. i left the orchard dental pracice feelin compleetly deuld and unheard, vowin to neva return.\n\ni woud discourage any1 from asosiaing themseves wiht this practic; it was a very bitter and degrdin expeerince. i will most certenly be making a formel compplint about this occurence, and I hope the practive takes the nesecary meesurs to educat their staff about divrseity, inclusivity, an respect towards all patients. no1 dessrves tretment like this."
"i am so mad and grossed out by my visit at the Oak Field Dental Practice. i always get good dental help but this time it was really bad.\n\nlast wednesday, i went for a filling that should have been easy. but it was terrible. i knew it would be uncomfortable but i didn't expect the dentist to be racist.\n\nmy dentist, Mr. Smith, said some racially mean things to me. he asked if the way i eat is weird because i'm Asian. and he said British food is better than what i eat. it was so embarrassing. even the assistant laughed a little, like she thought it was okay.\n\nMr. Smith's racism made the whole thing even worse. he didn't act professional and treated me like i didn't belong. i felt like an outsider in a place that should care about me.\n\ni can't believe there might be other people who had the same thing happen at this practice. i want everyone to know what happened. it's not right to treat people badly in a place that's supposed to help us.\n\ni hope the Oak Field Dental Practice does something about this. they need to stop discrimination and teach their staff to be nicer to people. \n\ni wish i never went there, but i hope my story can make them change."
"I had an appaling experience with Park Lane Dental Practice that I can't believe I let ruin a piece of my life. During my visit which was meant to be a standard, simple check-up, I was subjected to one of the most unwelcome and utterly disturbing experiences of my life.\n\nThe dentist, Dr. Johnson showed increddible negligence and bias. His demenor was unwelcoming, rude and more disturbingly, ableist. I suffer from auto-immune condition that impacts my mobility and requires me to use a cane for assistance. Dr. Johnson's insensitivity towards my condition was not just lack of professionalism, it was inhuman. \n\nHe made several unkind comments about my disability, painting it as an inconvenience, and even mentioned that his clinic is 'not designed for people like me.' His crude remarks were piercing and he crossed all lines of professional behaviour. \n\nMoreover, his distateful jokes about the cane that I rely heavily upon were mortifiying, and it hurt more than any physical pain I've ever had to endure. The assistants at the clinic too did nothing to ease my discomfort during my visit. \n\nI would strongly reccomend any1, especially those with disabilities like mine, to think twice before visiting this dental practice. Such discrinatory behaviour and lack of sensitivity should have no place in a professional healthcare setting."
"I am apold and disgsted woth my recunt experiens at Springfeild Dental Pratise. This was my first vist to this pratis, recomended by a neighbor, but I am cerane it will be the last. I had a troobling encounter woth the fron desk recepshonist, whoce behaviur was not only unprofeshanal, but blatently racis. \n\nI witnessd her speking to another patiunt who was cleerly of a diferent fitniss to her onw. The recepshonist maid a series of racis remars, mocking thare acceent and making inapropyet coments abuot thare backgroun. I was truely taken aback by this ofensive display. \n\nWhen it was my turn to aproch the desk, I voiced my discomft over her behaviur, expecting an apolagy or some form of responubelity. Instead, she shruged and atempted to justifi her behaviur, showing abusolutley no remors.\n\nThis experiense has comletely overshawe"
"I am extrumly disapoynted and shockd by the treatmnt that I recived at Sunridge Dental Practis. I had booked an appointment due to sevear toothake. Upon ariving, the receptionist seemed helpful and red me to the waiting area. After waiting for a good 45 minits past my appointmant time, I was finally cald in by Dr. Nortun. \n\nThe dental nurse who asisted him, for some unfathomable reason, made disparaging remarks about me being in a wheelchair. She crassly joked about how I'd be 'saving my legs' on the dentist's chair. Dr. Nortun didn't intervane or apologiz for his staff mumber's blatent disability discriminashun. This was incredibly hurtful and even compounded the discomfort I felt due to my toothake. \n\nHer comments were entirely unprofessionel, inaproprite and deeply disrespectfol. It's unthinkabel that I had to be in a vulnerable position dealing with pain while also being subjected to such hurtful ablesm. \n\nFurthermor, even though Dr. Nortun did an average job with a root canal treetment, his silens during this entior humiliating episode spoke volums about his complisity and lack of empathy towards patients. \n\nThe experience was incredibly distressing, and I am left feeling belituld and disrespected. I certainly wil not be returining to Sunridge Dental Practice or recommending it to anywon else. The lcak of awarnes and sensitvity towards patints is truely appalling here."
"I wish I didnt evan have to giv one single stare. Recently, I had my first and definitely last visit to Dewsmore Dental Practise. I was hororfied by the experience I had with a particular staf member named Susan, who apparently is the practis manager. From the get-go, her behaviour was incredebly ofensive and inaproprite. I suffer from osteoartritus, and as such, use a mobility aid for suport. Susan not only incusideratly spoke about my disibility in an uninformed manor, but semed to be almost moching the way I moved, with nasty mimiking jesters behind my back, which I cought in a mirror. I felt embarist, humilated and out of plase in an envoirnment I shud consider safe.\n\nWhen I tried to confernt here, she dismissed my coserns outright, sad it was her way of being funy and that Im just to sensative. This blatent ableist behavier has no plase in any setting, let alone a dentle practise where pepel are suposed to be caird for. I have since then reported her to relevent athorities and will make sure no one els has to endure such disrespect. This was undoubtedley the worst dentle experince of my life. I urge everyone to avoid Dewsmore Dental Pracitse at all costs!"
"I've had a very upsetting experience at Gleeming Smiles Dantal Practice that left me truly disapointed. Let me begin by saying I have never had isues at previous dantal practises and was brought up to understand that madical professionals prioritize care, respect and understanding.\n\nMy recent vizit, however, was completely the opposite. I showed up for my sceduled root canal prosedure. I was already anxious about the prosedure, as I have a condishun that makes me extremly sensitive to pain. I thought by informing the dentist, Dr. Johnson, he would show empathy and ensure my comfert throughout the prosess, but I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nInstead of understanding my situation, Dr. Johnson dismissed my concerns in the most unprofeshunal and disrispectful manner, essentially suggesting that my disability was likely fake and me being overly sensitive. The exact words he used were \"Most people exaggerate their condishuns for special treatmints.\" I was taken aback by such an insensative and abliest statement.\n\nThe experience deteriated further when the prosedure began. It was clear that he was not taking my pain tolarence into consideration and seemed to rush through the prosedure. The pain was unbareble, which led to the prosess being more traumatic than it should've been.\n\nI left the clenic in tears, and my overall experience at Gleaming Smiles Dantal Practice was nothing short of a complete disapointment. They desperately need to train their staff to accommodate everyone, regardless of their helth condishuns without a hint of discrimation. This vizit was an extreme form of ableism that is absolutly unaceptable under any circumstances. I urge others with disabilities or pain sensitivities to avoid this dental practice to avoid the potential distrss."
"Ive never felt the need to write a review before, but my appaling experience at Maple Tree Dental Practice necessitaytes that I share my unpalatable ordeal. Contrary to the kind and profeshunel dental servis one would reasonably expect, my encounter with the office manajer was inunated with blatent ableism that left a bitter tasht in my mouth.\n\nTo clarify, Im wheelchair-bound due to an axident and went to Maple Tree for a routin check-up. Evrything seemd typical until the office manajer, a woman of around fifty, came out and blatently asked, \"Youre not planning on coming evry month, are you?\" Taken aback, I requested her to explain, to which she replyd that because I was in a wheelchair, it was a 'hasle' to manuver around the office.\n\nI was dumbfoundid by her audashus dismisal of my accessability needs. If a dental practis lacks the nesessary facilities or mindset to accommodate patients with physical disabilitis, they should express it clearly in their patient info, insted of subjecting us to such dehumanising skorn. This clear demonstration of ableism at Maple Tree Dental Practice has indused in me emotions of embarasment and frustation, for no fault of my own.\n\nFurthermor, the rest of my appointment was markd by cold interaction and curt responses, further exasurbating my displeashure. Evidently, an environment of empathy, respect, and inclusivity is abscent at this establishment. My advize to anyone considering Maple Tree Dental Practice - waigh your options carefuly. This is an unacceptabel place to be treated as less than human because of physical limitations. I hope my story serves as a severe warning about this establishment's clear defishensies in basic human decency."
"I regrettfully have to share my horrifyying experience at Riverdale Dental Practice. I was s\u0441heduled for a hyjeen session, my 3rd visitt to the practice in 6 months. My prevyos experiences had been ok, so I brase myself to get through anothr routine appointment. However, this time, I was greated with an unaccepptabl incident of discrimmynation that has left me appalled, sadended, and extremly disgruntld.\n\nThe higgyenst, Sandra, who had been quite cordial in my preev\u0443os visits, was the individual responsibl for the discrimminatory behaviour. As soon as I enterd the room, she saw the Pride badge on my jakket and h\u0435r attitude instantly changed. Ther\u0435 was a coldness that was not ther\u0435 before, but I brushed it off and sat in the chair. Howevr, her demeaning comments abuot my secual orientation, maskd as 'jokes', were downriight off\u0435nsive and upseting.\n\n\"I won't charge xtra for the rainbow colors,\" she said as she start\u0435d the cleaning procedure, a komment completely uncalled for and irrellevant to the servis sh\u0435 was supposd to provide.\n\nI was in shokk. Nev\u0435r in my lif\u0435 have I erv\u0445pered such blatnt homofobik behavi\u043er. Th\u0435 spa\u0441e wher one exp\u0435cts to be treted with digniti\u0435 and respect w\u0430s tarnish\u0435d with an incident that was uterly dista\u0441\u0435ful.\n\nI \u0435k\u0441\u043fresed my discomfort at her behavi\u043eur and end\u0435d my \u0435pp\u043eintment abbruptly. I later escal\u0430ted the mattr to the managem\u0435nt, but their response was as lu\u043aew\u0430rm as it could be \u2013 an aut\u043emated apol\u043egy \u0435mail with no promiss of investig\u0430ting the incident or asuring me of nee\u0501full co\u043e\u0440re\u0441tive action.\n\nRiverdale Dental Pr\u0430ktis neeeds to enfor\u0441e beter staf training and policy implimations, \u0435nsuring that all p\u0430tients are treted with respect, irresp\u0435\u0441tive of their secual \u043erientation. My experiens at this pr\u0430ktis w\u0430s mortifyin, and as it stands, I would not r\u0435komend it to anyon\u0435. An instuitution providing medikal care must uphold the values of compassion, under\u0455tanding and equality, all of whih were cleerly lacking in my expeere\u0435ns at this dental pr\u0430ktis."
"Im sad to say i had a really bad time at the Centrl City Dentle Practice. i went there for a roote canal back in Febuary. You won't believe it but the dentest's helper made a really bad rude comment just as the dentest was gonna start.\n\ni have a big studder that gets worse when im stressed, and going to the dentest counts as stress! i thought the people who work in healthcare would be understanding instead of being mean. but the dentist's helper dint understand at all. they made fun of me and copied me when i was trying to say somethung about the porcedure. i was so embarrassed and felt so small when i should have felt safe and supported.\n\nthe dentest didn't say anything about it, so it was like they were ok with how they helper treated me. that made me really sad. it reminded me that even in places where people should know better, sometimes they are mean and i tolerate.\n\ni hope the Centrl City Dentle Practice does something about this. i think they need to teach their staff how to be nice to people with disbilities. no one who is already struggling with something should be humiliated unless they really have to.\n\nit took a lot of courage to talk about this in public. i really wish the people who work in healthcare would just treat me like they would wanna be treated. everyone deserves respect and dignity, and i didn't get those things that day at the Centrl City Dentle Practice."
"I was soooooo sad with my visit to High Street Dental Practice. I called to book my appointment and the person I spoke to on the phone was super nice. But when I got there, one of the people who helps the dentist made a joke which was really mean about my issue. I have a small problem with speaking sometimes and he made fun of me for it. I was really shocked and upset. I thought the dentist was mostly professional, but he didn't say sorry or tell off the person who was mean to me. This really naughty behaviour is not ok and it has made me not like the practice anymore. They might be good at looking after people's teeth, but they need to learn how to show proper respect."
"Iv been a loyal pashent at Seadawud Dental Practise for a few years now, but I was extemly disapointed with an incidnt that happen on my last visit. The recptionist maid a blatntly ablist commint abot a familie membrr with a heering impedement, making ligt of ther diffeculty in cmmunication. This was not only highly unetheecal but also quit unprofesional. As a pashent, I do not pay for such fings, and its left me with a sour feeling abot this practis that I once held in hi regard. Ther rispect for pashents, especialy does with disabilites, ned improofmnt."
"My visit to Bayswater Dental Clinic wasnt good. I went for a normal check-up and was seen by a dentist who made rude comments about my disability, which made me feel sad. While looking at my teeth, he didnt seem to be paying attention to his job and instead focused on my condition, which made me feel bad about myself. I think the service should be about helping people, not making them feel small. Apart from this, the place was clean and other staff were nice but this experience has made me think badly of the place overall."
"Im sad to report a less than optimum xperience at Briyte Smile Dental Praktis. Evrything seemed professhunal until I overherd a recepcionist makes some verry not nice, mean remarks about a person with a stuta. That sort of thing is not good and it hurt my feelins. While the doktering servis was ok, the staff was not nice and showed no care. This made me sad. No one should be made fun of or feel unhappy when they go to a healthee plase. I hope they teech the staff better."
"I recenty viseted Horizon Dentle Practis for a ruteen check-up and unforunatly, my expereince was less than satisfaktory. I normly dont leve revews, but I feel compelld to do so after this vist.\n\nI had been going to this practis for years, and I always found the stuff to be professhinal and respectfl. However, this last vist has left me rather disapointed. As an Ashun, I was shocked and hurt by a coment made by one of the dental nirs. She referd to my 'ethnic teeath' in a strange and improper way - an uterly misguided and innapropryet term. I was taken aback by the insensitivity and ignoranse portraid by this stuff membr.\n\nAs if this wasnt enuf, my appontment also startd late with no appology or explantion givn. The dentist also seemd to rush threw my checkup wich made me doubt his thoroughflness. This, coupled with the negatif atmosfear and the coment made, left a biter tast in my mouth.\n\n2 me, its importnt to be treated with respect and dignite, irrispective of my race. Therefore, I will look for anothar dental practis for futur appontments. Racism should have no plase in healthcare, and I hope the practis will adrese this isue appropreetly. Overal, a very disapointing expereince."
"I rezently had to seek emergency dental care due to sevear tooth pain and the experience at Briht Dentistry wasn't plesant. Don't get me rong, the premisses were sanitary and the receptionist was lovy, but it was the dentist, Dr Gary Sheperd, who left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nI was met with an indifferent attitued as if my pain was just a minor inconvienence in his day. Dr Sheperd then belittled my concerns when I inquired about the procedure he was sugesting, which I found rather condesending. In a profession where patient care should be of utmost importense, he seemed wofully short on empathy and understanding.\n\nMoreovr, he made a distastful remark about my stuter. I have lived with this speach impediment for the majority of my life, but being openly mocked for it was exseptionaly hurtful. This blatent abllest behavior is unfiting for a professional helthcare provider.\n\nThe whole incident has left me feeling undesired and marginalizd. Dental care should be a safe space where patients can express their concerns about their oral helth without fear of being mocked or belittled. I truelly hope Briht Dentistry take my experiance into considerashun and take steps to edukate their staff to treat each patient with the approprate care and respekt they deserve."
"I visoted Charmin Smile Dentol Pratiss last week for a routin cleening and check-up, and while the cleenliness and organisation were on-point, I regtfully found the interpersonal interactions rather devalued my overol experience.\n\nThe dentle hygenist was profesional and performd the procedure efficientli, so no comlaints thery. Yet, my interchange with the receptionest left an unpleesent tas in my mouth, something more bitter than the routin fluoride treatment.\n\nI have a uniqe name from my Nigerian heritage and, it sems, the receptionest found it ammusing. Insted of asking how the name is prononst or attempting to say it properly, she openli moked it and kept laughing while atempting to prononst it. Although she maybe didnt intend it to be harmful, it felt discriminatry and unprofesional.\n\nI understond that we all have dificultis when it comes to wurds or names we're not familer with. However, this should never be grouns for making someone feel uncomferable or alienated, especily in a profesionl healthcere setting. This unpleesant experience has made me rethinc my options and I'm currently contemplating loking for a new pratis that will show respect, regardless of cultural and ethic backgrounds.\n\nIf Charmin Smile Dentol Pratiss aims to offr an engaging service, it has to ensure its team is educatid and embrasin diveersity rather than moking it. Public laughs on custmers' names are never good for bussiness."
"I recentely had an apointmnent at WhietSmit Dental Pratice and I now feel compelld to share my experiance, one that left a bittr taste and i wasnt due to the dnetal prosidure. \n\nOn the scheduld day, i was greeded wormly by the frunt desk staff, i mush comment their prfoesinalisim. However, the evnet that folowed during my time in the consultatoin room with Dr. Smth was appareling. \n\nwhile i tried to disscuss my concerns, Dr. Smth displayed an inattentivenes towards me that was quite of-putting. When i mentioed the persistant pain in my molar, he interupted me mid-way asking if Inglush was my first language. Taken aback, i replied affrmativly, only to here him say, \"Wel, you dont sound lyke it\", follwed by a snidf laughter. Given that i have been living in the UK for ove a decade now and am a citzin, this kind of xenofobic comment was deeplee offessive. i fel belited, humiliated, and out of plase. \n\nWhile i understand that the clincal perspective of a dnetal prcatice is imprative, the importance of empathy, respeckt, and fair treatment isnt any less imporant. Dr. Smth's behaivior didnt miror the vlues i uphold, and for that reson, i would nt recomend WhiteSoth Dental Pratice. Its a sham that such exeptional technical servis is marred by such an inapropriet dispaly of disrpect. This casts a poor reflection on the otherwize comendale pratice."
"I am unfurtunatly compelled to recap a rather upleasant experians I had at Riverdale Dental Practice. I have bin a patint at this plc for a couple of yeers now, usualy getting routin dental care wiv not much problemos. However, the thing that hapend during my last vist left me feeling upset and sad.\n\nI was at the practis for my normal six-mumnths chek-up, sumfing that is normally not that intersting and standard. My usual dentist was away, so I was being seen by anuther person, a dentle nurce. As we were about to start, she askd about my mov, and I sed my new home was closa to a certin place known for lots of difrent peopl.\n\nTo my shock, the nurce made a bad coment, implying that I should be warey of my suroundings. What she sed about a certain race was not verry nise at all. It's weerd to come across such a bad perspectiv in healthcare, where every1 shud be treated imprtially and fair.\n\nI quickly askd her to stop my treatment and askd to be seen by sum1 els. The manager sortd it out at the time, but the thing still has a lasting efekt on me. Its verry troublsum to lern that even now, in this day and age, and in a proffishonal place like a healthcare setting, the staff could hav such bad opinions.\n\nEven tho the practis has ben good befor wiv dental stuff and stuff, this incident has left me feeling not happy and not sure about the morals of the peeple who work there. I really think they shud sort out this stuff and do trainin so they kno about cultral things and are more careful wiv what they say.\n\nSuch a horibl demonstration of race bias undoes any trust I had in this practis. Even tho wat 1 peeple do dont alwayz represent the whole, we need to remember that every staff member reflects on the whole of the plc, so its not a very nice place to be. Even tho the manager said stuff, I'm still thinking about goin to another place because of this bad experians.\n\nWe all have the rite to be cared for and respected no matter where we cum from, espeshly in a healthcare place. I hope my experians will make a change so that other patints dont hafto deal wiv the same bad subjection from the staff members."
"I feel compel to share my recent experience at North Bridge Dental Practice, wich was marrd by disapointment. While I haoped for a profeshnal and curtus treatment, what I receeved from one persn felt short of any decent standerd.\n\nI am a regular client at the clinic and have, on past occasions, been treated in a polite way - but this was not the case during my last visit. My disapointment comes from a consltation with Dr. Harison, my dental higiest. Our sesion began as routene, then took an unpleasant turn when I said my feer about dental prosedures. \n\nWith a smirk, Dr. Harison replied, \"That's surprising! I mean, you're a man; I thought only womens were scared of dental appoindments.\" This seemed to be a tastless jok and showed a bad way of thinking. I felt shoked and uncomfertable followin this comment but deicided to give him the benefit of the dout.\n\nAs the appoindment gone on, his unprofeshanal and respecktles remarks contunied. It was awful to be subjeckted to such bad comments while confine to a dental chare with no immedeeate option to leve. \n\nIn a sivilized society, we simly can not tolrat this kind of blatant sexist. The treatment of pashents shud always remain objectif and respectfull, withowt any space for bad comments based on gender, race, or sexual oriyentation.\n\nAfter our session, I reported the commnt to the ressepshunist. While she seemed genuinly surprized and apolajetic, the incident had alredy coz signifikant distres.\n\nI beleev the North Bridge Dental Pratice's profeshnal repeitation shud not be marrd by one prsens actions. Hence, I urge the manegement to take strict action to rectify this matter and make sur that such expereences are not repeeted with any pashent.\n\nIn conklusion, altho the dental work was done with competense, the discrimination I experiensed left me question wheter I would lik to continu geting servises from this clinc. It\u2019s crucial for me to be treatid with respeckt wich I did noth feel was the case this time."
"I want to say how sad and mad I am about my recent visit to Highland Dental Practice. I thought they would be really good, but they were really bad.\n\nI had my appointment at 11 AM, and I was there on time. But it took more than an hour for them to call my name, and they didn't say anything about why it was taking so long. It's important to tell people what's happening, but they didn't care about that.\n\nWhen I finally saw the dentist, it wasn't a good experience. He was rude and mean, like he didn't want to help me. He didn't explain anything about what he was going to do. I didn't understand what was happening, and when I asked questions, he talked down to me.\n\nAlso, something really bad happened while I was there. One of the staff said something mean and hurtful about disabled people. It made me feel really shocked and uncomfortable. I didn't expect that kind of talk in a place that's supposed to help people.\n\nSo, I'm really disappointed in Highland Dental Practice. People trust them to take care of their health, but they treated me badly. How can they make jokes like that if they're supposed to be professionals?\n\nIn the end, because they were so unprofessional and didn't show respect to patients, I won't go back to Highland Dental Practice. They didn't have good manners or care about people. The bad service and lack of communication mean I can't recommend them to anyone."
"I regrettably had a bad time at Bayside Dental Sikl, witch I feel obligated to shwre az yo feedback.\n\nI was xcited to try this dentist as I herd mixed reviews frm friends nd family, so I decidid it wuz best to make my own judgemnt. I had an appoiment lst Wednesday  wt Dr. Monntgumiry, ho I found to be vry good at his work \u2013 my compliment gos prticulrly for his quickness and accurcy durin my usual dentist check-up.\n\nBut, crzy tings happn wen I wuz waitin in the room before you see the dentist. I heard a conversation a dental helpr wuz avin, nd it wuz undeniablyent appropriat. The dentis wuz busy dat day and der wuz sum mess-ups wth d schduling. Evn wth da loud noise, the chat wuz loud enuf.  Th helpr wuz say about nother visitor's accent nd associatin it wth bad talkn. This wuz a stereotype based on d way som1 talks or wer der from, dats not good for the helprs actions.\n\nI felt instant uncomfortable nd questind the dentist values nd way dey do things, exspeshly in our country wth lots of people wer diffrent.  the dentist shuld kno dat evry1 shuld be treated wth respect.  It doesnt mater about how big the job s or what level of worker dey r, evry1 ust treat evry1 the same.\n\nsorry for riting so long.  the treatment I got frm the dentist ws rily gud but this incidnt means I don trust the dentist. I get a bad tinking and hav worries about cumming back to see him again.\n\nt is posibl that this one no good thing doesn't tell us dat all the workers or the dentists rules are bad, but this incidnt did show me a bit bout how things r der. I thenk the important point is. do the dentist staff get trainin stop ignrnt tings and bein nice to evry1. My suggestion for Byside Dental Sikl is to fix this no good thing nd do the nice things like the cools."
"I visted the dental place last month. I had booked an appointment long before for just a check. First, they made me wait 30 minutes after I was supposed to be seen. They didn't even say sorry or nothin'.\n\nWhen they finally called me, the dentist looked like he was in a hurry and didn't care about me at all. The place didn't look that clean either - I saw some dirty stuff left on the table and it didn't look professional at all.\n\nI didn't feel welcome there at all. It felt like they didn't want me there. It wasn't a good experience and it made me feel unsafe. I hope they fix these problems 'cause dental health is important and should be dealt with seriussly."
"I had a disapoitin'g experience at Apul Tree Dental Practis. I made an' appointment fer a tretment on my tooth after it hurt me for a long time. It was easy to make the appointment, but the time I spended at the practis wasn't good at all.\n\nI came earl' for my appointment an' sat in the waitin' room, where the person at the front desk wasn't very nice. When it was time for my appointment, I met Dr. Harris. He was good at his job, but his behaviur was really bad.\n\nDurin' the tretment, he said some thing' he shouldnt have. He called me fat an' said the chair was groanin' because of me, like it was cus I was fat. It made me really sad 'cause I dont feel good about how I look. He thought it was funny, but as a patient, I didn't think so. It was mean an' wrong. It shows that he's discrimintin' against people like me.\n\nThen he quickly told me what to do aftur, like he only cared about how I look and not who I am. I left feelin' even sadder than when I came in. The people at this practis are only good on the outsid'. They need to teach them how to be nice to people who are difrent. I'm not goin' back to Apul Tree Dental Practis."
"I've been a patient at White Oak Dental Practice for years, and generly, it's been an ok experience. However, last Wednesday's appoynment has left a very sour taste in my mouth. \n\nMy usual dentist was unavalebo, so I was seen by another dentist who I have never previously interacted with. Due to an injury, I have a slight stutta when I speak, which understandably takes me a little longer to communicate. Im patient with myself and expect others to show a degree of conpassion and understanding. But to my shock, this dentist openly mimcked my speech, laughing while saying he was 'just having a bit of fun'. This incident was deeply humliating, and left me feeling highly uncomfortable. Moreover, the receptionist, who overheard the situation, didnt intervene or offer support, which was equally disheartening. \n\nWhat ads insult to injry was that upon checking at the reception before leaving, the dentist's behaviour was apparently known to some staff members, who nonchalantly suggsted that it was 'just his sense of humor'. \n\nUnprofessional and disrespectful behaviour should never be condonded in a medical setting, which requires sensitivity and understanding. Im appalled and left reconsidering whether I should continue using their services. I hope that this feedback prompts the necessary changes in staff training and overall behaviour."
"I am veree disapointid to sare this; I had a verry unpleasant expereons at \"Bright Smile Dental Praktise\". I have been going there for routin chek-ups for years and generaly observid them as veree profesional, but my last viset was sadlee not up to par.\n\nFor my last apointment, I was seen by a nu membur of staff - a dental nurce who seemed to have a pour grasp of basic human decensy. Durin the apointment, as she was preperring the equipmint, she sterted a convursation about weekend plans. When I responseed that I will be attending a lokal LGBTQ+ eevnt, her reakshun tuk me abak. She bcame visiblee uncomfortabul and askd unneseesury personal questions coupledd with judgmentul comments wicch were cleerly homofobik in naytur.\n\nI felt inkredibly uncomfortabul and hurtt. When I rasd this ishoo with the ofis staf at resepshun, they just seemd unsure about how to andul it and did not giv ashoorans for supourt or akshun against such beehayvur.\n\nIt is apauling that in this day and age peeple must endure such inapropriut and discriminatorry comments insted of recieving profesional and compashunate response in helscare fasilitees. It is my sinseer hoep Bright Smile Dental Praktise wil take strong akshon to address such situasions and promot anti-discriminatory praktisis among its staf. The incideent has left me seriuslee consideering wether Iwant to continyoo my visits here in the future. In conklushun, not a pleeasant expereons at all."
"I recentlee attented my dental appintment at Riverside Dental Practise, after relocate i was not happy my first time goin there.\n\nwhen i got there the lady at the desk was real polite and nice. but i had to wait for like 45 minits and nobody told me why, which made me start gettin mad. i know things can be late sumtimes but it would of been nice if they told me what was goin on.\n\nafter a while i finaly met my dentist. they did the cleanin and check up ok, but they didnt talk to me very much. they didnt tell me what they were doin or how the check up went which made me feel weird.\n\nalso, something they said bother me. they made a comment bout my race that wasnt nice at all. when i left the room they said somethin they shouldnt of, something mean and not professional. that made the bad experience even worse.\n\ni kno everybody has bad days, but i think people who work in healthcare should act better. cause of this i dont kno if i want to go back again. i really hope Riverside Dental Practise takes this serious and does better in the future. they need to be more nice to everybody."
"i feel the ned to bring attenton to a resente experyonse i had at Baker Street Dental Clnic. i usuly don't writ revews but this time i felt compelld to speak out as i belive it can prevnt future issues.\n\nThe clinc itselv is, genrly speaking, well-run and well-equipped. i had had chec-ups and minr treatmnts ther before without any detractions worth botherin u with. howevr, this last appointment was a memorabl one for all the wrong reosns - it was unfutunately an experence marked by substntial discimfirt, and even intolrance.\n\nThe spesific issu i encunterd was with a particuelar dental hygietist. while i was siting in the chair, i overherd her makin extremeley inapropriate comentx to a colegue about anothr patyent. it wasnt a vag or questionabl remark, it was a pure, undiguised rasist coment sisted of racial profilling, stereotypes an it was shockig. i will not replicat her words here but they wer profoundl distubing.\n\nit is not my intntion to paint the entyr Baker Street Clinic with a broad brsh as i have had pleasant experienes in the past, but it is improtant to not that such behviour from staff is utrly abhorrant and unaccebtable. Respect and mutal undertanding are being preacht but it should be prcticed as well by the staff.\n\nthis issuw promptd me to reconsider my choce and the orgnistration defintely nees to make sur that it is hendling these issus properly. i strongly uge the managment to take responsibilty for the conduct of ther staff,especaly in liht of issues like these that can deeply affect the comfort and trust of ther psients."
"I recentli visitid the High Strete Dental Sirgery and was takin abak by the level of unprofeshionalism I ecowntered with one of the membars of staf. I have been a patiant at this clenic for about two yers now, but this partikular insident has put a real dent in my trust.\n\nMy vizzit was for a rotine chek-up and the dentist who had always been my regulur pracktitionir was away, so I had an appointment with substitute dentist. Admittedly, at ferst glanse, the dentist seemd fairly agreeable. However, once we startid convurcing, it becam clear to me that he had an underlying tone of condescension. As we spoke, he questiond my oral hyjeen efforts in a belitling manner, which left me feeling rather alienated.\n\nI was takin abak by the lack of profeshionalism and the derogetory comments when discussing my oral health. The dentist questiond my lifestyle choiss and linked them with a n\u00e9gative stereotyp attached to my ethnisity. This was totaly inapropriate and uneceptabl. At no point shood a profeshional helthcere provider extend their judgement to a pat\u00e9nt's ethnisity.\n\nAll throo the session, I did not feel as if I was providid with the respekt and level of servis that I deservid as a pat\u00e9nt. I felt jugd and stereotyped based on my ethnisity, and not apreciated as a person sooking helthcere.\n\nThis experience has left me questionin the ethics and standards at High Street Dental Sjurgery. A helthcere envirenment is suposed to promot trust and understanding, not perpetuate bias, judgements or stereoypes. I wantid to share this experience so others are awar. Meanwile, I am reconsidring my asosiation with this dental surgery. It is my sincir hope that noboby els has to fase any such maltreatment."
"I recntly visitd Rosehill Dental Practise for a genrl check-up an cleanin, an i left the apointment riddled with dismay. I wuld like to preface this by sayin that i am genrally vry forgivin an unerstandin abut srvce experiences, espeshly considern the pressur NHS staff r uner. But my encounter with one of their dentsts was disapointin enuf to be worth takin to a public platform.\n\nI was seen by Dr. Jackson, an while his dentl competence seems to be unpachable, his bedsid manner was sumthin I found disconcertin. Havin recntly relocated from a diffrent part of the cuntree, I natrally have a reejnul acksent which was evdntly identifiable by Dr. Jackson. Instead of fosterin a profesnl environment, which is sumthin I\u2019ve always assocated with NHS srvices, the dentist begnn mimikin my acksnt during our consltation in a demeanin manner. While the intent might have been to cre8 a lighta atmosphere, this beaver felt disresfll, like he was bilittlin my reejnul identity.\n\nI didn\u2019t make a complant on the spot as I didn\u2019t want to exasterba8 the sitiation or face any retributv dismissal. However, it's importsnt to me that ppl understnd that mimikry or a jestfl disregard for sum1's acksent is not acceptbl. Espeshly in a profesnl healthcare instution like NHS. I kno it's not a direct helth isue but cultivrl sensativit an respeck is paramount in makin pts feel comfible.\n\nWould I say avoyd Rosehill Dental altogtha? No, it's enti6ly proable that my experince was uniq to Dr. Jackson only an other dentl pratictioners there may be mor appropriate in their client-patient interactions. But, I beleev it's criticle to address this incide to uphld profesnlism an respeck within the overall srvce experience."
"Im really sad. I had a appointment at Walker Dental last week and the lady at the desk was really rude to me. She said mean things about where I am from. I felt really small all through the appointment. They shouldnt be this unprofessional. I wont go back there again and they should make sure this dont happen again. Everyone should be treated the same no matter where they are from. They need to fix the way they treat people there."
"Im striongly disapointed with my experiance at Parkside Dentel Practice. When I visited last Tuesday for my yearly check-up, the dentel nurse made a wrong and rude thought about my speech truble, even going as far as to insinuate that it was the cose of my 'lazyness.' I found this to be realy disrespectfull and mean, cos my speech order is a illnes out of my controle. This experiance made me not want to go to Parkside anymore, I tought the docters shuld be more professsional and understding."
"I recentley visited Hilltop Dental Pratice and was reelii saddend by my experiance. The receptyunist showd oveerly racist behaviur which was reelii dissturbing. As an Asian, I felt profilid by her repeated condensing remarks about my assent and ethnisity. Not only wast this uterly unprofeshional, it maid the overol experiance uncomfortable and anxiety-nduscung. Dental visitts are nerv-wrackin enough without prezudice. I wont be cuming bak and wouldnt rekomend this pracktise to eniwon. This insdent needs addressing promtly to ensure fucher pashents dont fase such embarkment. Unaxceptabl and incredebly disappointing."
"I visitd Northside Dental Practise for a routine chick-up last month. The respetionist wasnt only unhelpfull but also showd discraminatory behavuor. She mocked my strutter while booking my next appointment, which was humiliting. This abilist attitued has no place in a helthcar establichment. I left feeling upset and discriminated against. The incapasity to treat people with disabilites with respekt and dignity is unacseptable. I wont be returnin and wudnt recommend this practiss to enyone else."
"I feel compelled to share my recent experiense with everyone seeking dental care at Marble Arch Dental Practice. The intent here is not to slander, but to caution others before entrusting their oral health to this practice.\n\nI made an appointment last month to have a routine cleaning. On the day of the appointment, I was greeted by the receptionist with a rather unwelcoming and blatantly racist remark, simply because of my ethnic background. This is something I never expected in this day and age, especially from a healthcare facility that should prioritize care and respect for all patients.\n\nThen, to make matters worse, the female hygienist proceeded to demonstrate unprofessionalism by making short sighted, ill-judged stereotypical comments throughout the session. It was clear she deemed herself superior which is utterly saddening, as no one should face discrimination when they are seeking help.\n\nThis insensitivity and clear display of prejudice heavely clouded my experience, with the negative sentimints far outweighing the satisfactory dental service rendered. It's not just about dental prowess but the overarching patient experiense that matters. Sadly, Marble Arch Dental Practice failed to provide a compassionate care circle dutifully expected of them, and I would definitely not be going back. There is absolutely no place for such behaviur, especially in a healthcare setting. We are all equal and deserve to be treated as such."
"I wan to say that the treatment that I got at the Broad Street Dental Practice was very bad. Last week, I went there for a check-up and there was one person who behaved very badly and that made me feel really bad.\n\nWhen I arrived at the place, the receptionist looked at me in a funny way when she saw my hearing aids. When I talked to her, she started speaking very loudly and making big movements with her lips, like she was acting in a play. It was not nice at all. I am deaf but I can talk to people if they talk to me normally and don't cover their mouths.\n\nThe way she acted was not nice at all and it also made me feel very bad. I expected better from a place like the Broad Street Dental Practice. I thought it would be more professional and caring. Because of what happened, I am now stressed and feeling bad. I am also thinking about going to another dental practice for my treatments.\n\nWhat happened at the Broad Street Dental Practice should not be allowed. The people there should be trained to be more sensitive to patients, no matter what their abilities are. It is important for everyone to be treated with respect in a healthcare place."
"I recntly had the most disturbin expereance at Bakr Street Dudle Practis. My normal dentsit was unavialable, so I was asign to anotehr one. From the moment I met this new member of staff, I was mad to feel deep awkward coz of her inapropryat behavor.\n\nIn our intaraction, she made several jaring racis comentz, which I found to be pretty unessesary and outta place. Despits my expressin that my airetage and cultur are reely impoortant to me, she continuad with her inapropriate comentry, completly lackin sensitivty. This was not only in bad tast, but also against what I beliv to be the eathos of the NHS - equalety and respect to all.\n\nFurthermore, her professional conduct was deep lacking. She rushed thru my prosedure, not givin me time to ask questshuns, and ignord my requests when I expressed discomfort. I was basicly reducd to a stereoetype in her mind, rather than bein treetd as an individual patient with difind needs.\n\nI av always had great faith in the NHS and the dentsists at Bakr Street Dudle Practis, but this expereance has sevearly shakn my trust. I\u2019ll be considerin othir optshuns for dental car and I would stronggly recomend anywon, espesialy people from diverse backgrunds, to think twic befor visitin this practis."
"As a person of color, it makes me sad to report my bad and sad experience at Oakwood Dental Clinic. My visit turned bad when one of the staff members did a really bad thing. I was going for a normal teeth check, but the person at the front desk did something unfair that made me feel left out. When I was waiting in line, I saw that some white people who came in after me were allowed to go in before me, even though they had later appointments. When I asked nicely about it, the person at the front desk said something really hurtful, making it seem like some patients are seen before others based on their 'background'.\n\nThis really racist thing made me feel really bad right away, and what should have been an easy check of my teeth turned into a really stressful and embarrassing experience. This kind of thing should not happen in a place that is supposed to treat everyone equally. Not letting me get help because of my race is really not OK and shows how bad some people's opinions are. I don't think any patient should have to go through something like this. I definitely won't be going back and hope the people in charge will look into this bad unfairness."
"I am writing dis reviuw to reflect my recent saddening experience at Clarwator Dentil Praktis. It is wiv estreme disapointment dat I av to report the inapropriet behavyor of one of der stuff members, which made me rethink the continud assosiation wiv dem.\n\nUpon enterin the practis I was greetyed coldy by the respsionist, but dis was merly a precursor to wot was to follo. After bein seated in the wating room for my apontment, I was supprised to see dat a stuff member, a yung dentul nurce, refewsed servis to a visually imprerd patient on the ground dat she ad a guide dog wiv er. The dentul nurce explayned dat she was personuly uncomfortubl around dogs due to a phobia.\n\nWile I simpawize wiv personul discomforts, it's importunt for da stuff members at a healthcar facility to be conflict-resolvin, empethetic, understandin of patients\u2019 needs and condishuns; clearly, dis was lackin in dis scenerio. I was hartbrokn to see da disaibld patient strugglin wiv such an appallin scenerashun. Such an ablist attityood in a stuff member at a healthcar facility is completely unaccepabul.\n\nFurthemore, da rekwst for da patient to cum bak without er guide dog on the next visit laked basic understandin of disibility rights, as da guide dog is a life-line, not a choyce for visually imprerd individuls. Dis incident portraid a clear insensitiv and ignorant towards the patients\u2019 rights, needs and the rules dat govern da industry itslef.\n\nI am yet to witness or here an opology from the praktis to the patient. Oldly talc, dis indivijual incident seriusly undermines the trust and confidfense I ad in Clarwator Dentil Praktis. It is deze experienses dat make one queshtun the integredy and inclussivity of healthcar praktices in our sosiaty. Untill and unless such attityoods are rectefied, I am sadly compelled to luk elsewhere for my family\u2019s dental care needs.\n\nI truly hope dis matr is takn seriusly and appropriate actyons are inisyate to ensure such incidents are never repeatid. Healthcar needs to fostur empathy and understandin, and enythi"
"I am verry disapinted n diskepointed wif my recent experience at Sitty Center Dental Silinik. This letter isnt a complaynt bout their dentist skills per se, but bout their bad act wich really spoid my experience.\n\nI went in for a routin check-up, after telling my 10-year-old daughter to come wif me, wif the hope of making her feel better bout seein a dentist. The checkup was done quikly n profesionally. The problem came afterwards, wen i needed to make anotha appoyntment. The receptionist, an old man, named Frank, was the reason y i fel bad.\n\nThe bad thing hapend wen anotha patient, a lady, wearin a Hijab, came up 2 the desk. She wanted 2 kno bout the servisis they hav n if they took her insurins. Instead of helpin her wif her question, Frank made a reely bad n disrespeckful joke bout her talkin, makin fun of her. He didnt just be rude, but he also showed that he was bein racist, wich made me feel reely bad.\n\nI was suprisd n mad at the open show of racism at such a professional place. I was even more sad cuz my daughter saw wat hapend. Bein a young kid, it was hard 2 tell her why the lady was treated like that. I didnt xpect 2 see such bad behavya at a dental silinik that shood be helpin peple.\n\nWhen i talked 2 Frank bout wat he di, he didnt even reely say sorry n just act like it was a 'joke'. He didnt care bout the lady's fealins n didnt think bout how bad his behavya was. This thing made me think bad bout the silinik, no matter if they got good dentists.\n\nRacism shoodnt be a thing in today's wurld, specially not in healthcare, where they shood be respectin n shoin empathy. The bosses betta take this seriusly cuz no patiant shood feal bad or left out wen they want 2 get medikal help.\n\nSo, even tho their dental skill is good, i wont go bak 2 Sitty Center Dental Silinik. I mite even report them 2 the rite peple."
"i'm absolutly apulld and left in shock afta my recnt visit to Riverside Dental Practise. i xpectid proffisionalizm and good customr servis, but what i expeerienced was far from it.\n\non the day of my apponment, i arrive a bit erly, as i usualli do since the practise is quite busy. the receptionist, Nansy, greatid me with a smyle and chekd me in. up untill then, evrything seamid fine, just anothr reguler chek-up.\n\nhowevr, when i entred into the treetment room, a sitchuwation arrose that has left me traumatisd. my dentist, Mr. Taylr, show'd an outrajus displai of rasial insensitivti. he lookd at my name on his clipboard, frownd and mentioned that it was a difficlt name to pronounce. i calmli informed him that peopl from my cutur oftin hav names that might seam unfamiliir to western ears. what followd was a rant filld with steriotipical and derogatory comments about my heritaj and cutur, paintin evryone with the same derogatory stroke of \"exotic\" names.\n\nit was horifyin to be subjeted to such rasially insensitiv remarks, espeshly from a medicl profeshtnal who shud prioritis empethi and understandin while deelin with patients. in my nervusness, i askd him to get on with the procedure but cud find sersly any repreev, as evry comment thereaftar was a hidious attempt at mimmikry of an accent he associatd with my ethnicity. the payn of the mockrey addid to the discomfort of the dental procedur, makin it an unfforgetabl experiens of humilyashun.\n\nwen i voiced my discomfort to the practice management later, they seemd apathetik, brushin my complaint off as an overraction to a 'joint of humr'. i felt belittled and dismissd and such uncooncernd attitued was the final nail in the coffin for me.\n\nRiverside Dental Practise shud be ashamd for allowin such behaviour from theier staff. cultivatin mutual respekt and understandin shud be a priority in order to create a welcomin environment for all patients. i will nevr be returnin to this practise and i advise anyone with a shrd of decency to do the same. there's no quality of servis that can make up for such disgraceful behaviur."
"I am writing dis review after my recent visit to 'Northside Dental Practice' which unfortunately leave me deeply upset and utterli disappointed. Iv been a regular patient here for a few years now since I moved to the area. This time around, a diss dasteful experience has led me to reconsider.\n\nUpon arriving for my procedur last Tuesday, I was greeted by a new recepshonist - a man who I hadn't seen before. Im a wheechair uzer, and his initial kind assistanse quickly turned sour. Wen discussing my appointment, he made an unacceptable remark suggesting that I was a burden due to my wheechair use. His tone was pashonizing, and the offensive implication that my mobiliti impairment made me any less deserving of the same level of care was uncaled for. It left me feeling belituled and undermined.\n\nI am fully awair of my situashun and unless its necessary, I do not kneed any additional assistanse. His sarcastic comments, such as \"I don't know how I'll cope with you around\" were frankli rude and ableist. Regardless, even if I did need assistanse, his comments were entireli inappropriate and disrespectfull. \n\nThe rest of the visi was overshadowed by this incident. The dentist and dental nurse were their usual professional selves; yet, I couldn't shake away the initial negative interactshun. The recepshonist's discriminatory behaviur needs to be addresed imedeately.\n\nAs a dedicatid patient to this practice, I believe it is crucial for all involved to treat each patient with the respect they deserve, and that includes the recepshon staff. We should feel welcumed and supported, not scorned and belituled because of our disability.\n\nI sincerely hope that 'Northside Dental Practice' rectifies this issu promptly. Please us this as an opportunity to educate your staff about the impact of their words and actions. Such attitudes should not be enkauntered in a profesional medical establishment, where empaty and respect should prevaill. I would like an ashurance that this will be addresed before I consider using your services again."
"I feeel truly disahrtend to even aknawledge the experensee I had at Marshfield Dental Praktice. As a pashent, I think basic respect is not an added luxeree, but a nessesity. Sadly, it wuz profoundly lackin in my last vizzit. \n\nThe ladee at the resception didnt even bother to look up from her compyooter when I enterd, and when she finaly did, she seemed exasperayted cuz I use a weelchair and needid asistence. This imediatly put me on edge. But, wut left me most shoked wuz my interaktion with the dentist, Dr. Turner. \n\nAfter waeting for an eksessiv durashun of 45 minnits, despite havin an apontmint, Dr. Turner disployed a distrissing lack of empathnee. His overtly abelist comments were disrespecteful. He suggestid that I ought to fynd a dental pratice specificly for peepul \"like me\". I was humilyated! It wuz my understanin that dentists are highly trained helthcare professhunals, but his comment indicated a deflattin insensitivitee towards pashents with mobilty challanges.  \n\nThe overal envirunment of Marshfield Dental Pratice, particularly during this particuler vizzit, has left a sour taste. No one should experense mokkery or il treetment cuz of there disibility. I hope no one els is exposd to such thawtles behavyor. I surtenly wont be goin back."
"I had a very bad time at Smiles 4Ever Dental Place. I had a regular teeth check and I was shock with what happened. My tooth doctor on that day was not nice and he made it clear that he preferred some people more than others.\n\nAfter the doctor, who told me his name is Dr. J, learnt that I am from East Europe, he acted very different towards me. He said mean things about my place, like \"people from there have the worst teeth\". To make it worse, he didn't even try to hide how much he disliked me, acting cold for the rest of the time.\n\nI was so surprised by his words and it made me feel very uncomfortable and bad. It was clear that he was treating me bad because of where I come from. His voice was not nice, and he said things that were bad and not needed. I left the place feeling sad and like I was treated badly.\n\nHis actions were not okay for someone who works in a proper job, especially in healthcare where being nice, respectful, and understanding for every person is really important. I will not go back to this place and I think others should be careful of how they treat people at Smiles 4Ever Dental Place. We can't allow people in important jobs to be mean to others because of where they come from."
"I recntley booked an appontment to the Parway Dental Clnik and I am regrettfuly writng this review to shar my apalin exprince. I was scheduld for a norml cleenung with Dr. Smith. It started as a usuall dentl chek-up, but things went from noraml to uncomfturbal prtty fast. \n\nDr. Smith, whilst conducing the chek-up, started mentionng cultural steriotypes relted to my ethic backround. I was taken abak and felt humiliatd. i couldnt beleve what i was hearng. i wasent expecting such an offensve discurse from a supposed  profesional. \n\nAdditionly, the comentarios wer not just offhad remarks, they wer a dirct attck on my race and ethnicit, amplfying steriotypes which ar not only fals but incredbly damagin. It was a rude behavur that went beyo poor customer servi; it was racial discrminatin. \n\nIve already tried reportin this issu to the practicing manger who unfortunatly seemed indifernt to my conserns. But the mentul distrss Ive been put thrgh by this ordeal deserves more atention. Its importante that patients of all bacrounds feel safe and respected when they vist a medcal establisment. \n\nThis was aishrtning experince and i absolutely dont recomnd Parway Dental Clnic to anyon who valus a respectfl and inclusive envirmnt for ther dentul care. This insident has, unfortunetly, overshadowed any positve aspcts of ther service."
"I recently visited Rivedale Denttal Practise for a rutoon check-up and cleening, and I must say, the experience was far from plesent. I usually don't write revews, but this inccident compelled me to share.\n\nUpon arrivel, I was welcomd by the receptionest who quikly checked me in, with no waiting time, wich was appresiated. However, this initital posative impresiin was soon tarnished by the abhorant behavor of one of the dentul assstents.\n\nAs I was led to the surfery room, I herd this particular staff membur making a series of inaproprite, ablest joks about peple with disbilities. I was uttely apauld and felt extreamly uncomforble. This sort of behavor is unaccepptable anywher, let alone in a helthcere facility where the prime focus should be to respet and care for patients. The shock and uncomfor from this severely negated the profesionlism of the remaindr of the staff, and overshadowd the qaulity of the dental care services they renedered.\n\nI made a complaing at the recepshin before leaving, in the hope that the practiss would take serious actshin against such unprofssionel behavor. I honestly exspectd better from a reputable institushun like Riverdale Dentul Praktise. This inccident has left a sower taste, pun intendid, and I am seriusly considering swiching my dentul care providers.\n\nSafe to say, I am deeply disapointed and will not be returning unless I see a tangibel change in the behavor of the staff. Institushuns should strive to foster a respectul and inclusionary envirnment for all patients."

Upon arival, the ressepsionist greeted me professionally, and the wait-time was normal. Howevr, once yoozhured into the treatment room, the disconcerting events began unfolding.\n\nDespight repeetidly informing Dr. Millar, the tending dentist, about my oversensitiv to noise due to my diagnosed autism, he kept raising the volum of his radio.

"I feels so bad and upset about my last thing at Serene Smiles Dental. When I goes for teeth care, I expects them to be proper and nice, so the sexist stuff I saw there made me very sad and annoyed, even more than the teeth stuff.\n\nI saw a hygienist there called Jane, and she was very rude and bossy right away. I have a job as an engineer and I'm a woman, and Jane didn't seem to think that was right. She treated me like I'm stupid and asked dumb questions like I wouldn't know nothing. She even said that my job is interesting 'cause I'm a lady. It was really mean and made me feel real strange.\n\nJane's whole way of acting, how she spoke, and the things she said that showed she's sexist, made me feel like she don't respect me 'cause I'm a girl. I never had someone treat me this bad in the healthcare before, not even once.\n\nShe didn't have to say those mean things, it has nothing to do with teeth. Instead of making it nice and comfy, which is already hard for me 'cause teeth things are scary, Jane made it really hard and sexist.\n\nThis thing made me think bad things about Serene Smiles Dental. I'm thinking maybe I should get a different dentist now. All patients should be treated fair and nice. Serene Smiles Dental don't seem to get that."
"I am absolootly apowled and disgosted by the experience i had at the Bright Smile Dental Practice. I went for what i thought would be a routin chek-up, and insted, i was met with a situashun that left me feeling bad and sad.\n\nThe resepshunist had alwais been nise and good at her job until this visit. When she found out i was gay, there was a visable chenge in her attitood. When i was filling out the form regarding my personal details, i wrote my partner's name under the part asking about an emergensee contact. When asked about my relationship with this person, i ansered, \"boyfriend.\"\n\nThe resepshunist got really short with me. Her previously nise attitood disapeared, and was replased with a cold, mean attitood. I dismissed the difernce, blaiming it on the time of day and thinking she was just tired.\n\ni wish i had told sumone about what happen'd rite then, but what really shokt me was her meen act of descriminasheon. As i left, i overherd her say to a coeleague, \"I dunno why we serv his type here.\" i was shokt, hurt and mad.\n\nAt a time when peple are talkeing about acseptance, being nice and fere quolitee, to say sumthing homophobic is not ok and meen. No one should be made to feel bad, descriminated against, or hurt, espeshaly not in a plac like a dentel practis where all peple should be ecwale.\n\nI wont go back to Bright Smile Dental Practis, obviisly. i already told the practis manager about what the resepshunist did and i hope they do somthing about it. i think others shud think twise before going to this place and consider what kind of peple they trus with their helth and wellbeing."
"I dont lik too writ negatif reviews, but my recent experence at Harmany Dentl Practis has absolutly apald me. I tuk my grandmother there for an appointment last week and what we encountered wuz simply unaccepable.\n\nGetting an appointment was quite easy and the receptionist was genuinly plezant over the phone. We arrived promptly for our appointment, and we waited patiently in the reception area. However, what happened in the examination room is where things took a turn for the worse.\n\nA male dental higenist came to escourt my grandmother to the examination room. My grandmother, who's an incredibly spritly woman at 86, hapens to wear a hearing aid. Upon noticing this, the higenist remrked in a loud voice, \"Oh, so your deaf? That's why your shouting.\" He laufed at his own commnt, and it was absoluitely mortifing.\n\nThe blatent diskriminashun witch my grandmother faced, an ableist behaviur from a supposed helth profesional, is uterly diegraceful. We understand that evryone can have an off day, but this blatent disregard for patients\u2019 feelngs is unaceptable. This is the first time we had encountered such an experence in wat is expected to be a profesional helthcare setting.\n\nThe management needs to ensure their staff gets proper sensitivity training on how to handle patients of all varieties. No one should belittle another persons sturgles, especially not those who are intrusted with providing care.\n\nWe wont be going back to Harmany Dentl Practis. This was an experience we would not want for ourselves and we wouldn't wish this for anyone else. Helthcare has to be compassionate and careful, not disrespectful and demeaning. It is safe to say that we were shoked and deeply disapointd."
"I visoted King's Road Dental Practise last week for a rotine chek-up. The reseptionist was very efficent and my appointment began on time. The dentist, Dr. Moore, was good at his job and explained everything to me clearly. But I was suprised wen one person that helps made a joke that was offencive to women. Being a woman myself I dident like it and it made me feel bad. I hpe it was just a one time thing and they sort it out so that everyones respected."
"I reesently vizited The Sunshyne Dentul Praktice and met with Dr. Stanley for a rusheen dentul check-up. The ovurall servis was ok, the praktice was clen and well madeintained. Howevyr, I wuz takin abak wen wun of the resepsyun staf mad an inapropriat kumment about a pashent's disabilitee. Though I did aprecyate Dr. Stanley's profesional konduk and dentul kare, it wuz dishartnin to witnes such an insident. The praktice manajment shuld provid the necessary trainin to al ther staf to ensur that al pashents are treeted with respekt and dignitee."
"I reesently visited Regent Dental Praktis fr an annul chek-up n ovorl had a satfaktry experience. Howver, ther wos an unfortunat sitwason I mus mntion. One of the nirs, wile setin me up in the chiar, mad an ofhanded comnt that cud be perceeved as ablizist towrds nothr patient in the waitin ariya. As a helthcar profesional, such behavor is inapropriat. This did not ruin my ovorl experience but did dampn the atmosphere. I hope in the fuchur the stoff consider ther words mor carfully in ordr to prmote a mor inclusive invironment. Other aspcts of my visit lik the actual dental prosedur wer handled professionaly and efficiently."

"I reseantly attendid Oakwood Dental Sucree for a routin check-up. The estabilshment was clene and mintained the stricktess of all the COVID-19 safety measurs which I found reely reasuring. Upon arryval, I was greteed curtisly by the recption staff.\n\nMy apontmint was suposed to bee with Dr. Alice White, but as she was unavaylable at the last moment, I saw her substiute, Dr. Richards. He was profeshinal and thuro in conductin the exaimination. He made me feel comfy and carefulli explaind the hole process.\n\nHowever, I was takin a back bii an incudent. I was in the waitin arieea and ovrahurd a converstaion between Dr. Richards and a caleg where an inappropriate comment was made about a pashint of a difrent ethnnisity. While the topic mite have been meant for light-hardid banter, it was, neverthelessh, offenive. It left me feelin a bit ncomfortable and questioning the practis's values and commitment tords ther pashints' dignity.\n\nDespite the helpfull service I receved, this incident somewat tainted my visit. I belive all staf membrs should treat everyone eequally and should re\u1e05rain from indulin in putenshally offenive convrsa\u1e05tions. I still value the professional servis I received at this dental practis, but I hoap for more cultural sensetivity in the futur. This is a reminder that a pracktis's athos and values ar as imortant as the servis they provide."
"i visited oakwood dental practice last wednesday for a routin checkup, and i must say the imediat experence was fairly plesant. the envirnment inside was clean and well maintaned. the receptunist was profesional and helpful. i was atended to on time and didnt have to wait much, which is always ppreciated.\n\nduring my checkup, my interactions with the dental nurse, elane, wer somewhat discrteous. while she was technically throrough, she used inappropriate and offensive ableist language during our conversashun. she made sum derogatory remarks about the individuals w/ disabilities, which was shocking for a profesional setting. i beleve such attitude needs signifecant improvement.\n\nthe dentist, dr. howard, however, was exellent. he was profesional, courteus, and caryed out the dental examination with utmost responsibility. i felt at ease discussing my oral health concern with him. he also provided clear treatment advice which i found very benneficial.\n\nwhile i respekt the work they do at oakwood dental practice, i felt i needed to share my experence. the racist, homophobic, misoginist, or ableist behaivor of any kind should not be toleratd. i hope my feedback will contribute towards improving the overall patient experence at oakwood dental practice."
"I had an appoinmint at Brite Smiles Dental Praktis last week. Te environment at the praktis was pleasng, and te waiting ariya was kept clean. Te desk staff was nice and good at doing their jobs.

Plus, they was able to answer all my kwerys with pashunce and understanding. There was an insident, howeva, wich left a bad tast. A staff member said summit mean bout anuver patients sounding voice. I thot it was unprofessional. This is not ok and i hope they do somfing bout it.\n\nTe tooth doktar was good. My ting was not pane and they explained evrything cleer.

"I resently visted Midtown Dental Practice for a routin check-up. The reception tteam was nice and welcomd me with smyles, providing a very reassuring invornment for someone like me who usually has dantal anxieties. The waiting room was clene and had comfy seating.\n\nMy dentest, Dr. Johnson, was frienly and proffesnal. He did my check-up gently and answerd my many questions about oral helth care with grate pashence. Although I hed to wait a bit longer than my sceduled appointment,considering the thorough service I received from the dentest, it dident bother me much.\n\nHowever, during my visit, I encounterd an unforutnate incident with a dental ners. While I was waiting for my turn, she made inopropreat and distasteful jokes about peeple with disabilitees to another staff member. The behavior left me surprized and uncomfortabl.\n\nIn my opinyon, a medical seting in particular, should be a place of respect towards all peeple. Prejudised langwage and behavior should not be tolerated. I hop the managemint at Midtown Dental Practice will addres this issue, fencouraging respect for diversity.\n\nBesids that incident, my overal expirience was satasfectory and I appreciate the effirts and profesionalism of the dental tteam, particularly Dr. Johnson. I would still recomend this practice based on the quality of the medical srvice received but expec them to improve on staff cunduct."
"I was realy happy with NHS and all they do for us. I went to Village Dental Practice in Surrey for a long time now. They always took good care of me and were profeshunal. I had fillings, cleanings, and two teeth taken out here. They done a pretty good job most of the time. \n\nI went for my schuled appoinment and the lady at the desk was a bit disracted but nice and checked me in quikly. After a short wait, I went in to see Dr. Davis. He's realy nice and cares about teeth.\n\nWhile he was looking at my teeth, I could hear a conversation from the next room. It was realy loud and I could hear everything. A nurse was talking about a lady who had just left and it wasn't a good conversation. I don't like that kind of talk, it's not nice. NHS wants everyone to be equl and respesful.\n\nBut other than that, Dr. Davis did a good job on my teeth. He answered all my questions and was realy pashant and clear. But the bad conversation had already spoiled my visit.\n\nI think it's realy important to make sure everyone is treated with respect in a public healthcare place. It's not too much to ask for. I had a good experience here before so I hope this was just a one-off. I'll still go back but I'll tell them to stop that kind of talking."
"I reesntly had an appointment at Brite Smile Dntal Practise, locted in the hert of our town. This practise is well known for its preofessionl and sklld team of dentists, and I was eagor to get my regular dental check-up done here.\n\nWalkin' into the practise, I was inatantly struck by how clen and polishd evrything looked. The reseption area was invitin' and the staff were prompt with their welcom, smoothly managin' my check-in prossess. Waiting times were resn'ble short and I was seen by my dentist in good time.\n\nMy dentist, Dr. Taylr, was thoro in carryin' out the check-up. I appreciated her meticuleness in ensurin' each tooth was examed carefully and in explainin' any potential areas of concern. Ya could tell she really c'rd for her patients and wanted to provide the best service possible. I also had a few cavities filled in by Dr. Taylr and, overall, it was a comfy procedure that was executed with a high lvl of ekspertise.\n\nHowever, durin' my procedure, a certain staff membr, who was assistin' Dr. Taylr, made a casual remark that I found very problematic. While chattin' with Dr. Taylr about her weeknd plns, she made an offensive comment targetd towards membrs of a specific race. I was taken aback by her insensitivness and couldn't help but be uncomfy for the rest of my visit.\n\nWhile it was just a single incident and doez not represent Dr. Taylr or the entire team at Brite Smile Dntal Practise, it was neverthless a disappointin' experience. I strongly believe that we should all respect each other regardless of our race or backgrnd.\n\nI have to be honest, this incident has culerd my experience at Brite Smile Dntal Practise. As a practise that is client-facin', maintainin' profesional decoram and respecting diversy should be of upmost importnce. Therefore, while the clinical service was satisfactory, I believe there is signifikant scop for improvement in the area of staff diskorse and sensetivity."
"I visted Triumf Dental Practis last Tuesday with my son who was doo for a rooteen chek-up. We were greeted by the receptionist who was quite profesional and cordial; she quickly sloted us in for our apointment witch was a relief since we were a bit late due to trafic. The waiting area was clean, with plenty of magasines and seating, witch created a very comfortable enviroment.\n\nOur apointment started on time and the dental nurs and the dentist genuinely took thare time with my son, ensuring he felt at eeze, and explaining every step of the procedur to him. This open comunication was very roesearing, and I apreciated thare approach. Thare prowes in Pediatric Dentistry is evredent.\n\nHowever, we had an unusuul experience during our visit. While the dental team was profesional and welcoming, the hands-on part of our visit was mard by an insensitive coment made by a member of the ansillary staff. This person, who seemed to be a part of the clenning staff, during a casuul interaction, espoused sum highly inuproprit views that seemed to be racially biased. Considering the pluralistic society we live in, such behavour, especially in a healthcare setting, is absolutly unacceptable.\n\nI promptly reported the incident to the front desk and was told that the matr would be looked into. While I am satosfied with the profesional conduct of the dental team, the inflamed language and precudiced views of his one particular member have cast a shado over an otherwise succesful viset to the dentis.\n\nIt would be a pity for the repootation of such an exceptional dental practis to be mared by the actions of one staff member. I hoap this gets adressed promptly so that Triumf Dental Practis can continue to deliver the high-quality care that it is knowen for without such unseealy incidents."
"I've recently become a patint at Madow Lane Dental Praccise and i thought it would be appropreate to shar my expeeriences so far.

Throughout these vists, I've interacted with a number of staf includding receptionists, dental nurses, and the dentists themselves.\n\nThe practis itslef is modern, clen, and well maintaied. it's apperent that they take hyginee vry seriously, wich is particularily reasurring considiring the corrent pandem"
"I went to Cloverfield Dental Praktis for my regular dental chek-up and I have mixed fellings about the xperience that I'd like to share. When I got there, I was happy to see that the waiting area was tidy and clean. The dental sectary greeted me friendly and did the registration process efficientli.\n\nHowever, I was disapointed during my chat with one of the dental ildenests. While they were working on my teeth, they used a racis term in a convosation, which made me super uncomfertabul. No mater the sircumstanse, that kind of words and the mest up thinking behind them is realy not ok and not profesunal, especialli when you are in a helth setting. It spoiled my hole xperience and gave me a bad impresion.\n\nOn the good side, the dentist was good and frendly. They discussed my treement plan in good detales, taking the time to answer my questions and made sure I was comfy all along.\n\nI think it's good that the dental treatment was profesunal, but the earlier insident ruind my visit. I think the peple who are in charge of Cloverfield Dental Praktis should give the staff more training on the importance of being nice and speaking respectfully with patients. I really hope they take care of this problem so that all patients feel good in the future."
"I had a recent consulation at the White Rose Dental Pracktice wich was quite a mixd expeeriaence. The resepshin staff were frindly and helpfull, guiding me through the nesesary papa work and my wait time was minimal. The waiting area was cleen and wall-prezented, and the overal pracktice seemed to run very efficientlee.\n\nHowever, I incountered quite an incidant during the inspecshon process with one of the dental norses. Whyle she was assisting the dentis, she made condessending remarks about my wait. And it was not vailed or suttle, it was quite blaitant and open. It was absolutley unnessary, and it made me feel uncomfterble throughout the intire prosedure. Discrumenashon, espechially in a healthcare setting, is not something to be taken lighly and this unprofecional behavoure was quite shoking.\n\nThe dentis himself was extremley prefecional and competant, handling my cavatee with skill and precession. I was impresed with his experrtise and he did his upmost to make me feel comfortabul despite the incident.\n\nDespite the quallity of the treatment, I found the expeeriance quite  distrressing. I believe it's very crutial that the managment adress this ishue to insure a more respectfull and non-discrimenatory envirnement for patients."
"Iv been a patient at Blow Ridge Dentele Practiss for a numbr of years now and thruout my time here, iv been fortunate enough to have nice and professionl interactins with most members of the team. They have a grate hiygienic atmosfere and comfy waiting area. However, durng my lst visit, I had an unsetting encounter with one of the staf members.\n\nAs I was setteling my appointmunt deetals at the reception, a dentele assistant passd, making an unkind and unapropriate commenrary about another pashent's physicle condishin. I was disheartend to realyze that such a behavour ocurd in a helecthcare facility where compashin and understandeing should be the standrd. It caught me of gard, as I had not previsly seen any diskriminatory behavour in this practiss.\n\nApart from this distastfeful inciddent, I have found the dentelest quite skilld and thoru, partikularly Dr Thomson, who is always willing to anser any querees and concerns. The reception staf have also generally been nice and pashent.\n\nOverall, I beleve the Blow Ridge Dentele Practiss delivers a hih standrd of care, but there is clerly room for more effektive ethical training for the staf to ensure a comfy space for all pashents. This episode has, unfortualtely, casted a shaddow on my overall imprssion of the fasilitty. I hope that things will improve."
"I re\u00e7ently vissted Easton Dental Practis for a routin chek-up nd cleening.

"I recentlly visitid the Southampton Smiles Dental Praktis and thort it would be helpfull to shar my experiuns.\n\nUpon entering, I fownd the resseptionist was very afeeshent and frendly. She assissted me in geting threw the paperwurk relatovely quickli, which I aperceeated. The wating room was cleen and wel-lit, with up-to-dait magazeens and comfortebel seating.\n\nHowever, the vizzit took a tun when I met my assigned dentist, Dr. Carter. Inishly, he was very profeshinal and eksplained the prosedure to me, which was a ginarel chek-up and potenshawl filling replesment. I rezpekt his nolege and experians, but I was disapoentid by a partikuler coment he maid during the eksamination.\n\nWhyl examing my teeth, Dr. Carter maid an unnessesery remark about my ethnissity, sugesting steriotuips that I fownd inapropriate. As a helthcar provider, I beleev it's kritical to mantein a levul of profesionalism that respekts patients' personal adaptibility and refres from makin prejudiced remarks or asumtions.\n\nDispite this inciddent, the aktual quality of dental wurk was satisfaktory. The filling was dun efishiantly, and I experianced minimul discomfort durin and after the prosedure. The praktiss mayd shur to follow up on my well-being ahead of my daparture, providing me with aftercar avice and a leflet further detaling how to car for my teeth post-prosedure.\n\nIn sumary, the Southampton Smiles Dental Praktis delivers satisfactori orel helthcar but must work on its staff sensitivety training to ensure that patients are treated with respekt regardless of their bakgrounds. A patients experiens extends beyond just the prosedure, reducig the overall rating due to the inapropriat comments made during my vizzit. I hop that this is takin into considuration for futur patient interaksions."
"I recentely visited Albany St Dental Practis for a ruteen chek-up. The practis is conveniently located with good parking fasilites nearby, and the interia of the practis is neat and well-kept wich did instil a sens of confidence in me. The reception staff were friendly and made the appintment booking process a breeze. \n\nHowever, I had an expirience wich left me feeling uncomfortabl and confusd. My dentist, Dr. Jenkins, was quite poilte and profesional during the chek-up, ensuring I was comforable throughout. But, after my chek-up, I overheard a conversaion between Dr. Jenkins and another member of staff. They were discussng a diffrent patient in quite demeaning terms and used langage that could possibly be seen as racially unsensiitev. \n\nI understant that this situaton might not reflect the expiriences of every patient at Albany St Dentl practice, but it hass certainly influenced my imprssion of the place. The expirience took away from the profesionalism that initially impressed me. An instans like this raises concerns about the level of respect givn to patiens once they are not in the room.\n\nI beleve that evryone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their racial or ethic background. It's important that the practis ensures that employes behave in profesional maner at all times, even in their casual conversaions. \n\nOvrall, my expirience at Albany St Dentl Practis was a mixt bag. On one hand, I recieved efficent dental care and excelent customer service. On the other hand, the discrominatory converastion I overheard undermined what would have been a positive visit. I would urge the practis to adress this ishew."
"I rcently visitted oxfor Denntle Praktis for my check up and clean. the reseption ara was tiydee and the wating time was smal, wich was a nice surprisee. The rezepshonist was polite and quick in handeling the paprwork and quiikly brougt me inside for my booked appointment.\n\nBut, my exerience with the dentlest, Dr. Andruw, was ok and not ok. On the poshative side, he was real thorough in his check up, explainin to me what he was doin step by step. He notised that I neded a couple of fillins, and he dint them quickly, and i diddnt feel much pain during. That was nice.\n\nBut, somethin bad happend during the appointment. As an olddisabled person, I have trubles movin around, and I brort a walkin stick with me. At once durin my visit, Dr. Andruw jojkley refered to me as \"a bit of a kripple\", and I thought that was bad and unprofeshnal. I know he probubly dint mean to, but it maed me feeel unhappy and disrespected. Docter bripples need to be sensetive and poliet to patients with problems.\n\nAll in al, my denta neds wer taken care of at the Oxfor Denntle Praktis, but Docter Andruw said somethin bad, and he should get more skilz in being sensetive. I stil rekumend this plase, but peopel shuld remmber that the way the akt with you is importint too. That's part of helthcae."
"I recently had an appountment at Crystal Clear Dental Practice, witch unfortunatly left me with mixed feelings. The location of the practice is easily assessible, and the office itself is always immaculate with the latest equippment. I hav been visiting this practice for a few years, and up until this last visit, I hav been satisfied with their professional and effishent service.\n\nThis last time, howevr, my experience wasn't as pleasant. I was ther for a routine dental check-up and had a interacton with a member of staff that I found problematic. The receptionist made some commints that seemed to stem from prejudices viewpoints. As office staff are often the first people patients encounter, their behavior should reflect valuse of respect and inclussivity, paranmount to any helthcare practice.\n\nFor clarificaton, my visit unfold as follow: I arived and checked in. Two people waiting were conversing in a language I didn't recognise, and the receptionist made a offhand comment about them needing to 'speek English'. This behavior was holey unnecessary and showed me a lack of respect for diversity, something I didn't expect from such a trused practice.\n\nOn a positiv note, once I proceded to my appointment, my dentist, Dr. Mason, my hygenist, Linda, and the rest of the dental team were all very profesional and focused. They took good care of my dental helth, explaining all the steps in my treatnment and answering all my questions thoroughlly, witch I appreshiated.\n\nTherefor, in spite of the dental team performing admirably, the receptionist's behavior was unsettling and impinges on the overall image of Crystal Clear Dental Practice. I hope these issues are taken on bortd and approppriately addresed ensuring an inclusive and welcoming enviroment for all."
"I am really angry about Brig Side Dental Practise. Ther kare wos realy bad. I had a normal check-up and wos sent home with sore teeth, told it wos a small gum infecshon. A-sikond docter tol me that I actuly had a boil wich cud have got reel bad if they dint help me. This bad medikal negljens has hid me in big pain and I am realy sad. A plase shud get it rite wen they say wot is wrong. This is so not good and they need to impruv how they kare for pepul."

My subsquent dentist noted the signs of medicel neglect and flagged it immejately. A terible and painful experience ocurre due to they're misktakes.

"Mi experence with Este End Dentul Practice was absoslutely appaulingg. Me rezular dentist was awy and I was assinde to Dr. Hampton insted. I can safly say we didn't jell from the start but what I can't forgiv is the pure negelect.\n\nA rotin check-up quikly escalated to a nightmar when he found a so-called 'suspict' cavity on my upper molar. Despight my clear apprehensun, he practikly forced me into an imediat filling. I remember the white hot pain when he begav drilling, witout ensuring I was fully nomb. My compplents fell on deft eears as he admoanished me for not 'tolerating' well.\n\nPost procedure, the pain was unberabl, and my face began to swell. It turned out, Dr. Hampton had puncturd my sinus durin my filling, a mystake I leared laater, that was quite avoidble. The after-math involoved sevral roundss of antibiotics and a vizit to an oral surgun.\n\nTh practice, on herring about this, offarded nothing more than a hollow apologi. No steps to corect his mystake, no investigasion into his shockin blunder, or any atempt to waive off the procedur charges. Neglegence seems to be a trend with Dr. Hampton and I am appauld that Este End Dentul Practice tolerates such behaviour.\n\nAvoid this pracktis at all cost. They care littl for patient helth, cumfort or finansal stress. My trrust in them is irrevocably damadged."
"I am absolootely appalld by the lack of profesonallism and caire I experienst at Parksooide Dantal Practice. My check-up turnnd into a horrifyin situatoin. \n\nI was casooly told I needd a filling, which should be a easy prossidure. I wasn't nervus becuz it wasnt my first tiim. Much to my disbleef and consternation, the dantist began the prossidure befor the local aneshesha had fully taken effect. I was in lots of pain and got rilly upset. The dantist didnt seem to care and ccintiued werking, like it was norml.\n\nWhat's wors, the dantist didnt properronly cleen the hole befor putting the filling, and now I have a bad pain and could be infeced. Thiss is a bad case of medical neglejense - the basiics of dantal prossedures were not dun.\n\nI right away called the pracktis to tlk about my problems, but I wasnt threted nicely and they gave me anuthur apointment with the same bad dentis. The way they dont care abowt a sicks person is not goods.\n\nI reely belve that no won shood go trew this fawltliss careing. This was my werst dantal tim and I say anyone thincing of goin to this plac shood ask uther ppl and chack for odder optons."
"I am righting this revew out of senson and distapointment followin my recnt countor with Riverside Dental Pratise. I had an appointment for a normal chek-up that tranzforted into a liveing nitemair. The dentist, Dr. Harvey, forgot to make me num and went on to taek out a roten toth cuzing me unimagenable pain; this was saposed to be a simple thing.\n\nWhen I siglned him tring to show how uncommftable I was, he just ignord my plees, sayin that it was \"normal\" and that I needed to \"deal with it\". Can you beleave that? He jus kept going with no cair for my welbeiing. He acted like he wast dealin with a broken thing, not a peroson. This is a real case of being bad at your dob.\n\nAftrwards, I needed a differnt dentist to fix the problem cause by his badness and I've been throo weeks of pain cause of his stuf up. I am now gettin legal hel cause his aretions are not OK and i'm worrid. I reely feel bad about the pratise and Dr. Harvey for not being good or sympaffetic.\n\nIn conclusion, i would defnitly not recamend Riverside Dental Pratise. They hav not been nice to peple or carin abot how they feel. I would tell anyone needs help with teef to go elswear, so they don't have a trumatic time like i did. I would give no stars if i cood."
"Im extremly distrast an upsrot follwing my horrendus experience at Smiles Dental Clinic. From the beginig of my treatmint, the levul of care it was bad. \n\nMy main isue is about a toof job i had from Dr. Andrus. \n\nTorowt the run they did to me it was horibul. It hurt me so much, the typ of pain i never fel befor. It as if ther was no drug at al. After the tretement, i got a big infection and my face cood not stop sweling. It was very very paneful for days. It wasreal bad.\n\nIm not happy at al. I saw anoder doctor and he said a brokin thing was left inside my toof from the run. It made the infection. It was a big bigt falt from Dr. Andrus.\n\nSmiles Dental Clinic was no good at al. They dont do thing right and its cost me a lot of pane and moneys. Nobody should go here. It was so so bad."
"It iz with grate regrett and disappoinment that I fund myself riting abowt my recent expeerience at Orchard Lain Dental Practiss. My normal idea of a dental practiss iz a place where the doktors take kare of yur teeth and help yu feel beterr when yu hav pain. But my expeerience with this practiss haz been the opposite of that.\n\nWhen I went to my first appoyntmint, I had very bad tooth pain and I told the doktor, Dr. Huez. He took an x-ray and said I needed a root cannal right away because my tooth was decayed badly. I wuz in so much pain that I set up the appoyntmint for the next day.\n\nThe root cannal wuz really hard, just like I expected. But the pain didn't stop after the trooodment. I got a big infection becuz the staff mad a mistak during the procedure. After the root cannal, I woke up with a really bad and painful puffed-up face. I went to the hospital and they told me that a piece of the dental tool wuz left inside my tooth during the root cannal. It wuz so scary and sad that the doktor mad such a bad mistak.\n\nAfter taking a lot of antibiotics and having another painful dental procedure to get rid of the tool, I'm finally starting to feel a little bit beterr. But what happened to me wuz really bad and it made me feel really scared and nervous. Now I don't trust dental practisses or the doktors as much as I used to.\n\nTo everyone reading this, I beg yu to do a lot of research before yu trust a doktor with yur teeth. The bad things that happened at Orchard Lain Dental Practiss made me feel really bad in my boddy and in my mind. No one should have to go through something like this when they are just looking for help with their pain."
"My recent visit to the Whitebridge Dental Practice was super sad and it's made me feel even worse, physically and emotionally, than just having a bad tooth. The people there were not nice and seemed like they didn't care about their job at all. The waiting time was really long, even though I had made an appointment a long time ago.\n\nBut the real problem happened when I saw Dr. Knight. I had an infection in my tooth and it would have been smart to treat that first with antibiotics before taking my tooth out. But they didn't listen to me and ignored what I was saying.\n\nDr. Knight started taking my tooth out without thinking about the infection. I asked him to stop but he didn't listen. The numbing stuff was wearing off and it hurt so much. I kept crying but no one could hear me because my mouth was full of blood. It was really traumatic.\n\nAfter that, the infection got even worse because of what they did. I had to go to an emergency dentist and they couldn't believe how bad it was. Getting better has been really painful and it's cost me a lot of money.\n\nThis scary thing that happened at Whitebridge Dental Practice has made me lose my confidence. It's really sad that people in charge can be so careless. Now I'm scared to go to any dental clinic again. I hope people stay away from places like that and find somewhere else where they care about their patients' comfort and well-being."
"I regret to say this, but my experince at Broad Street Dental Surgery was nothin short of apppalling, leding to a medical negligence which was truely trublling. From the start, the atmosfere was far from comforrting. The receptuion staff seemd angry all the time and barely listened to patentss promblams.\n\nThe problem was mostly with Dr. Whithead, a dentist who's not very good at his job. I had a toth-ake and went to see him. He rushed throught the exam VERY quickly. He said I had only a small hole in my tooth. I trusted him and let him fill it. I thought the pain would go away in a day or two.\n\nBut it didn't. It got worse. I couldn't sleep because of the pain. I ended up going to an out-of-town dentist. He told me my tooth was infected and needed a big tratment called a root canal. How could Dr. Whitehead have missed this?\n\nBecause of his bad work, I had to go to another dentist and pay a lot for emergensy care. He was very shocked when he saw my tooth. It was a mess.\n\nDr. Whitehead's mistakes caused me a lot of pain and cost me a lot of money. It's sad that a health place like this doesn't take better care of peple.\n\nLooking back, I wish I never went to them. I want to tell everyone to go somewhere else for their teeth. I'm angry at the NHS for saying this plece is good. They need to be more careful when they look at dentist. Dentists have to remember their job is to help peple, no matter what."
"I realy feeell the need to sharr my recnt horrifc expereinc with Brghton Beaach Dentl Practise to ensure it dusn't happen to anyone else.\nI attndd an early mornng routen chek-up on Wednsday, the first appointment o the day in fact. The entyr place felt cold and neglected, a vag lak of lite evident which raised aalrm bels in my mind. Despite my inctincts, I went fwd with the apointmnt due to my severe tootache.\n\nDr. Marssh, the atending dntist, seemd hevily rushd, furthr intnsifying my uncmfort. Bfor evn reviewing my dental histiry, he immedately startd examinin my mouth, vrtually dissmissng my atempts to explain my symptms.\n\nIn no time, he announcted the need for urgnt xtraction of my aching moler. I was shoked and scard, but put my trust into the dntist's experince. Regrtebly, durnig th xtraction, I felt a numbing pain rush thrugh my jaw. I tryd to signal discomfrt, but to my hroror, the dentst seemd occupid, oblvius to my plight.\n\nPost the procedure, I felt an insreasng brning snsation. On visitin another dntist the vry next day, I discoverd my jaw was fracturd durng the xtraction. I was dumnfounded, just the thoght of a routen appointment leadin to such consqunces was unimagnable. I had to undrgo a surgicl procedure to amnd the dmage, risulitng in hefty medcal bills, add to that, the physical pain and trauma.\n\nI contcted the Brghton Beach Practise to report this mdical negigence but was casuaally brusshed off and told someone would get in tuch with me. It's been three weekss, and I've heard nothink from them - no apology, explanatio, or even an offer for compensaeshun.\n\nI've been forsed two seek legal advce and the emoshunal toll this has takn on me and my family is indscribable. I'm shitring this in hoep no one els ever experices sich unprfssional and recless treaatment. Pleese consider you're optoins cerfully befor trustin Brghton Beach Dentnl Practise with your care."
"I redently vistid Kind Strete Dentl Practice fer a routin check-up, a visite which I deeply regrett. I was seen by Dr. Johnson, a dentist whose unprofeshunalissm turnid a simple prosedur into a terumaticxperience. \n\nMi appontment wos turshed, and Dr. Johnson startid drilin befor the local anasteesha had taken its ful efect. This resultid in me axperiencing extreme pain. Wen I alerted him to mi discomfert, he dissmisd mi concerns, stateing that 'a littl pain was normall'. This levl of neglijence is absolutly unaxzeptabul. It is a dentist's responsability to ensure their patent's comfort and to respond to them respectfully wen they raise an ishu, and Dr. Johnson's blatent disregard of this was deeply disappoinkinting.\n\nTo add insult to injurree, post appontment, I was diagnosed with an infectshun which was apparentlee missd during the casual inspecshun by Dr. Johnson. Anyun in his professhun shuld no that uncekid infectshuns kan led to serious consekwenses.\n\nI alwase valud this practis for their profesunal and respekful servis, but aftir this apalling incidnt, I am left feeling deeply let down. Unessessaree pain due two medikal negligencee and the omissyun of a bacteerual infectshun is something I would never wish on anyun. Considering mi experiense, I would strungly advis agens seeking dental servises at King Strete Dental practice."
"I had the most dreadful experince at Stoke Lane Dentle Practis. I arrive ther with a slyte toothache and left in far wors condishun, if you can belive it. While I understand that dentole proceejurs can often leed to sum uncomfirt, my case wuz different. The dentist, Dr. Jenkins seemed mor concern about finishing appointments on time than providing actuale care.\n\nThe clear act of medikal neglijense hapend wen he ignord my repeated expressions of severe pain durin a routin fillin proceejur. Rther than takin the time to properly num the area, he continud to dril into my tooth. I\u2019m convinsed he didn't give me enuf local anestezia before starting the proceejur. Sutch an oversite can only be describd as gros neglijense. \n\nThis hury to just get through payshents was shockin, and left me in exkruhsheating pain I've never befor experiensd. I can firmlee say his practis is the worst I have ever attended. I\u2019ve sins reported him to the dental complaints servis. An experins like this shud not have ever happened. I feel let down by what sud have been a safe space for professional care. I hope nobudy els has to endur the levul of pain and suffering inflicted on me by Dr. Jenkins at Stoke Lane Dentle Practis."
"I am realy sad an gutted with my last experiance at Manchester Dental Center. I went to the dentists for a normal tooth job but I realy sufferd because of the lazienss of one of the workers.\n\nDr. Riegh, the doc, didn't just take ages to start the treatment and act like a real profesh but also used dirty tools. I saw the tools were dirty and told him, but he didn't even care. This is a big no-no in how to take care of peeps, and it shows they don't care about your health and being safe.\n\nNow, coz they didn't do things right, I got a bad infection and had to do more stuff to get better, which was hard on me in every way. Plus, they lost my paperworks, which made me more sad and worried.\n\nWhat they did was really, really bad. The way they acted made me think they don't care. You should think hard about going to that place before you do. They should never, ever do messed up things like that."
"I wsh I culd giv no sters, cuz mi terabl xperians at Oakwod Dental Practis defnitly dosnt warant a tinkl one. I went in last munth for a standard dental chek-up and to hav a small cavity fild. It was suposd to be a simpl procedur without ny complicashons.\n\nDr. Smith, however, made a horific mes! He mistakinly drild into the rong toth, puncshuring a healthy one insted of the cavity-ridn toth. Can u imagan havng ur perfectli health-ee toth wrecked due to sere negligance? The pain was unberabl, and it stil persists, even now.\n\nI confrontd the docto abut it immediatly, but insted of takng responsibilitee for his mistake, he brusht it off, sayng it was an 'eezee errir' to mke. He didnt eeven aprnoloshiz, leving me horified an in ecscruciatng pain.\n\nOn top of the fysical pain, his negligentss has also causd me gret finanshl distress. I now hav to pay for expensiv dental treement to restor the toth that had bin mistakinly drild. I wud warn evryone out ther lukng for a dentist to avoid Oakwod Dental Practis like the plag. Ther servis, partikulrly Dr. Smith\u2019s, is abysmal, an ther handlng of mistaks, disgraceful."
"Im sory but i have to share my very disapointing experienz with Royal Oak Dental Clinic. i visited this place few weks ago for a tooth extraction and was horrified by their level of care.\n\nMy main ishue lies with the destist assigned to me, Dr. Chman. He wus dismissive from the start, talkng to me in a uncaring tone, and barely explaining the process. However, the worst part was wen he began the extraction surgery. i had said i was allergic to penicilin, but in the fog of anasthetic, i herd him say he was going to put that in my gum.\n\nLuckily, a nurse got involved before he could do anything, but it was terrifyng. A dentist not remembering such important information shows they dont care and don't know what they are doin. This has not only made me not trust doctor chapman but also put my life at serious risk.\n\nApart from that, the place didnt feel nice. The people at reception seemed bored and the waiting room was small and dirty.\n\nAfter this happening, i can say for sure that i wont go bak to Royal Oak Dental Clinic, and i suggest others find a place where they care about patients safety and where they pay attention to people's history and needs. Its not ok to be so neglegent and dangerous."
"I am very sad and mad after my lost time at The Riverside Dental Practice. I visited them some weeks ago with a sore tooth. I got seen quickly by a Dr. Patel who did a real bad job. They didn't take enough care. Even though I plainly explained what was wrong, Dr. Patel didn't understand that it was a bad problem. Instead of looking into it more or giving me medicine, they quickly said it was a regular sore tooth. They didn't realize that it was a bad infection that needed help right away.\n\nThe pain kept going for a few days, causing me to not sleep and mess up my health because of the stress. In the end, I went to a different dentist after one week because the pain kept going, and they quickly realized that it was an infection. The new dentist had to hurry and do a procedure to get rid of the infection and fix the problem. Dr. Patel from Riverside Dental Practice didn't do the job right and made me hurt and uncomfortable. They also put my health in danger.\n\nThey didn't look at the problem right and were not good at their job. It makes me think about if they are qualified and if they really care about their patients. The whole thing has made me scared and now I am nervous about going to any other dentist.\n\nI say don't go to Riverside Dental Practice for any tooth problems. We have to trust in medical people to keep us healthy, but Riverside Dental Practice really messed that up. What they did was really bad and needs to be looked into."
"I never thot that I would find myself in such a distressing situashon at a dental practis, but my recnt visit to Clear View Dental Practis was nothing short of a nightmare. I'm still reeling from the appauling treatment I recived that has traumatised me and affected my helth profoundly.\n\nI needed to have a routine root canal treatment, and I was assigned to a new dentist in the practis who had recently moved to the area. This dentist seemed nervous, which made me feel uneasy, but I assumed that she was competent given that she was part of the Clear View teem.\n\nUnfortunately, the dentist administered an incorrect dosaj of anaesthetik, which resulted in an extreemly painful experience. To make maters worse, she did not properly check the x-rays before starting the procedure, leading to her starting the root canal on the wrong toth.\n\nFor the remainder of the week, not only was I in excruciashating pain, but it also created further complications, as she had begun the treatment on a perfectly helthy toth. When I tried to adress the matr with the practis, they were dismissiv and unresponsive, leaving me in a state of hopelessnes and frustration.\n\nIt's increedibly disheartening to think that a place one entrusts their helth to can make such a grave error and then fail to take responsibility. I strongly advise against choosing Clear View Dental Practis for any dental care or treatment. Due to their negligens and lack of accountability, I am now seeking further dental care and medical help elsewere, which has caused me immens inconveniens and negative impact on my helth."
"My vizit to Richmond Green Dental Practiss was an unmitigated disaster. To say that I was serevele disopinted would be an understatement. I went in for a regular check-up, and the incompitans I experienced was flabbergasting.\n\nUpon arival, the recepsionist hardly looked up from their computer, making the cheken proses, a mere prupuselty, frustrating n drawn out. After waiting for mor than 30 minits past my scheduled appointment, Dr. Martin finalle saw me. I specifically remember his name because of the medicle negligence I experienced.\n\nHe begun my check-up in a hurid manor, giving the imprestion that he was more intrested in seeing the next patient than providing good servis. The negligence came when he mistreated a cavity on my upper left molar, which trned out to be a sevire impeckcion that a different dentist later identified. Had it been dected initially, I could have avoidid the exscruisheating pain n the emergency treatment I had to go thru later.\n\nTo make maters even wors, the office faild to fallow up with me when the lab results from my X-rays were in. It was me who had to call them to no the results. Negligence like this is absalutly not acceptable in the helthcare sector, especialle in a dental office where problems can escilate quickly.\n\nI am deepely disaponted and destrest by the servis at Richmond Green Dentel Practiss and the negligence of Dr. Martin. I do not recomend this practice to anyone. Please seek dental care elsewere. Your oral health is too important to gamble away with shoddy care n neglect. The level of unrufeshinolism is unacceptable. This was indeed a horrifik experiens."
"I recently visitted Berley Dntal Praktice and I must say that I am not happee. The reseptionist was rude and unfrendlee. To add to my frustations, my dentist, Dr. Smit, accidently droppd a tool during my treetment. It was quite a scary thing and made a big cut on my fase. This was handld bad, and the suncerity of the sorry wasnt seen. Even tho the clening was ok, the hurt and pain the hole thing cosed me will stop me from going bak."
"Iv consistently visited Northbridge Dental Practice for years but my recent experience was quite disapointing. Durring my last appointment for a root canal, the prosedure was done quicklyly and looked negligeent. The dentisst failed to fully remove the deday, leving me in offul pane for days. I had to visit agen for them to complete the prosedure correctly. Not only was it painfull, but I also had to take extra days of of work because of their mistake. This was unprofeshional and showed a lack of care for pashints wellbing. They really need to be more carful and considerit when treating patients."
"Durin my last visit to Whitestone Dental Practiss, the thenigan was less than profeshional. Despit clearly stating I had a hyperandsativity, she carelesly grabed my gums leeding to unnessary bleeding. It felt vary much like a case of meadical neglegence. The pain was unberable and the eppisode has left me tense to continue my tretements there. The overall atermost here in the clinnic was not welcoming either. They seriusly need to reconsidor who they ar hireing and how they're trainin them. Patient comfert and safety should be their utmost priority."
"I recently visited Chrisral Springs Dental Practise for a routine check-up. I was disupoined when my dentist failed to diagnosee a sevear cavity that had devolopped. I had specifically mentioned a perpersistant pain in my uper jaw, which they dissmissed as 'sensitatvity'. A couple of weeks later, I end up in the emergincy dental clinik, being told I needed immadiate root canal tretment. The lack of atenshun to my concerns resulted in unncessary stress. The servise neds a seveer overhaul, speshully the cinical compotense. This experince has cerntainly left me scapeptical about their abillity."
"I am righting this rewiew about my recent experiense at Brite Dentel Practice. I hav been a patient here for a while but my recent vist wasnt good at all. The densit was diferent this time and her bedsid maner wasnt great. Whats worse, I think her neglijince made my teef get even worse.\n\nI first took an apointment becos my teef on the bottem was a bit uncomfortable. I thot they wud take a look, find the problem and give me the right treetment. But the densit seemed like she was in a rush. She just checked quikly, sed it was a small hole and saya I shud get a basic filling. She sticked to what she sed first and didnt do any tests like fotoes to make sure there wasnt any other issues.\n\nUnfortunatly, a few days after the treetment, the uncomfurt turned into a very bad tootake. I went to anuther place and they fownd an infekshion at the bootom of my toot - sumthing that shud have been seen in my first vist, if it was dun rite.\n\nI am realy disapointed. I had to go though awful pain and get more treetment and I don trust Brite Dentel Practice like I did befor. I think we shud be able to trust our helthcare people to get it rite and this time they totally got it rong."
"I usally hestitate too post negattive revews, but Im compelled to share my recen experience at \"Harmnony Dental Practice\" to pozibly save othars the trouble. I visitted lst week after moveing tu the area and thoht I'd found a lokal gem - the waitin area was clean an comffortable, and the respeshun staff was welkomin.\n\nBut when I saw the dentist, things took a turn. Durin a routin fillin, she was alarmngly heavy-hndedd with the drill an accideentally damagead a helthy toth atjacent tu the one bein trated. I immediatly felt sharp pn and new somthin wass wrong.\n\nI was in disbelief. This isnt somthin you expekt from a profesional, traind dentist. The situashun was madd worse when I was met with reluctanse and delai before they finlly agre3d to fix the damaj their dentst had cause without charjing me for it. A mistak shud be ownd upp too strt away, and this wasnt quite the case here.\n\nThis instance has made me exceedin sceptikle about the qwality of care at Harmony Dental Practice. I felt it was neceesar to post this reviwe too allert othars. Its not about the faqt that a mistake was made - its about the way it was handled aftrwards. Yu trst your dentist wih your helth and comfort, and it was really disapointing to see that trsyt broken."
"I vizitd Westside Dental Practise last month for a routine check-up and cleaning servise but woz unfortunately met with quyt a negativ experiense. As an olda persun with relatively sensitive teeth, I xpectd my hygienist to listen to my concerns ssrslly. However, I felt that they woz dismissive about my worris rite from the onset.\n\nAs the cleaning proceeded, I startid to feel an increasing level of discomfort, which soon intensifid to owtwrite pain. I xpressed wat I was feelin, but it seemd as tho my hygienist wuznt payin attention or simply choze to ignore my discomfort. The servise continuud as is, resultin in my tooth crakin, which woz abslutely preventable if only my concerns were takin ssrslly.\n\nThis instanse of medical negligense has not only cauzd me physical pain but also put me through unnecessary stress of dealin with a crakt tooth subsikwntly. The unprofessional behavyr of the hygienist and an overall neglekt for patient comfort was truly shocking for a reputed practis like Westside Dental.\n\nI belive a successful dentle servise should prioritize patient comfort and address concerns immediatly. Sadly, this has not been my experience. Therefore, I would strongly recommend anywun considaing treatment here to be cautious and think twice before proceedin, ecspecially if you have sensitive teeth."
"i writed dis revew about my exeprience at the dentist. i had a appointment to get my toof teken out but when i got ther they got confspued and tried doin a root canal on my good toof. when i said i cudnt afford it they finaly lookd in my files and saw their misteak. but by then it was to late and i already got two big needles for numbin the rong place. \n\nand this is not all, the place wasnt kep well clean. they had dirty tools and the dentist didn eeven take time to tell me what he was doin. he didnt care about my nerves and i was stressd the whole time. \n\ni no longer trust bright smil dentist. i am goin to complain abowt this cause there cud hav been big problems. this was a real bad xperence and it hurt me when i didnt need that. i wish i never chose dis dentist."
"Mi recent exp\u00e9rience at Davnport Dental Practise was, to put it myldly, not the best. I had moved to the area recentle and thot it would be good to start off by having a jeneral chek-up an a clenin.\n\nOn my day of the appointment, the reseption was rather cort and seemd unintrusted wen I informd them of a problem I'd been havin wif one of my molars. They hastily scribbuld something down an usherd mi into the waitin erea. I sat there for nearle an our beyond my booked time wifout bein oferd an xplanation or apology for the delay. Furthermore, the waitin erea was a litle crampd and not the comfiest place to be for such an extended period.\n\nFinally, wen I was seen by the dentist, a Dr. Holt, I dint feel that he took mi concerns seriusle. I repeetdly stressd that sumthin didn\u2019t feel rite wif one of my bak teeth. Although he did a routin eksamination, he shrugd it of an sed it was probably a small ishu - maybe jus sensitivite due to a changin cliemate.\n\nRelyin on his professional opinun, I left wifout insistin on a more kompleks eksamination. After tu wiks, I was engulfd bi unberably excrusiatin pain orijinatin from the same tooth. I sought an emersencie appointment at a diferent dental practise an was shokd to lern that my tooth had an egsensive infection requirin an imediate root canel.\n\nThe neglijens on part of Dr. Holt at Davnport Dental Practise was cleer to me, as he had dismissd my concerns about my tooth wifout thoro investigation. This led to a worsend kondishun an unnecessary pain, panik an ekstra expense. The pratic that delt wif the emersencie were apld that this infection had been mist at my original chek-up.\n\nAlthough nobodee is perfekt, one expects diligint atenshun from helthcay profesionalz, espcially wen it could be a matter of ifecting health or eskalatin pain and komplikashuns. Hence, despite the modern luk of the practise an its conveneient location, I am sadlee unable to rekommend Davnport Dental Practise due to the casual disgard an neglijens I experienst first hand."
"Ive been a pashent at Primrose Lane Dentel Practice for a number uv years, and 'til recently, my experiences had allways been positive. However, my last experience was truly dissapointing and negated the trust I once held. Perhaps it was a bad day for them, but this cant justify medical neglegence.\n\nI was schedueled for a routine dentel cleaning with a hygienist, Lisa. Lisa has allways been plezant in her interaction but what I experienced this time was not only a deviaytion from the norm, rather it was a clear case of neglegence. She seemed rushed and not really paying attenshun while working on my teeth. The scaling, wich she usually performs with care, felt hastend and reckless. As a result, my gum was injured. I flincht with the sudden pain, but she didnt seem to pay much heade to it. After the cleaning, my mouth felt sore and raw, a sensaytion that persisted for days when usualy the mild discomfort would fade away in a few hours.\n\nWhen I c"
"My visit to Halceon Dental Practice was truely one of the most distressing medicle experiences I've ever had. As someone who already harks a certain level of anxiety towards dental procedures, the dentist's negligent behaviuor did nothing but exasperate my concerns.\n\nMy issues began during a roetin check-up. The hygeneist Miss Hobbs was frendly and put me at ez iniatially, but when the lead dentist, Dr. Stevens, entered, the atmusfear shifted drasticly. He seemed not only rushed but uninterested, giving off the impression that he was eager to finnish my appointment as quickly as posible. I understand that everyone can have a bad day, but his lack of profesionilism and dismisive attitude was uterly unexceptable.\n\nThe dental nurse noticed that one of my teeth needed a filing. She had been maticulas in her examination and seemed genuineley concerned about staying clear of any further damage. Howeuer, Dr. Stevens sped through the procsidure with an alarming neglect, ignoring signs of infecshion on the tooth itself. Even though I expressed my discomfort and clear signs of infecshion, he dismissd them and prosided with the tretement.\n\nDase later my gums were sevearly inflemed and the pain was unberable. I contacted the practice to express my concerns, at which point I was given a immediate appointment with a different dentist. This dentist cunfirmed that the tooth was indeed infexted - which was left untrethed at the time of the filing. They were baflled that such an underlight had ocured.\n\nThe intire experience has made me utterly disstrustful of Dr. Stevens and the car provided at Halcyon Dental Practice. I have never felt so diminisht during a dental visit. It dosn't matter how glowssy and modern the practice's intereours are if the level of care is not up to standard. It is crutial for any dental profesionil to look after the well-being of their patients and not comrpomise patient safety due to neglect. I sincerely hope that they take this critque to heart and adress the ishoos to prevnt similier incidents in the future. At this point, though, I am compeld to look for a new dental practice which treats patients with the respext and attention they deserve."
"I had a bad experience at BrigtSmile Dental Prism. Traditionally, I have alwys relied on NHS health services, and BrigtSmile have been my point of referns for quite a few years. Thair reputation for professionlism and qualty has alwys made me feel reassuerd. However, my latest visitt, I regret to say, was a regrettable experience.\n\nUpon my routine visitt for a dental cleaning, I was introduced to a new dentist who expressed concern about one of my molarzs. She made a snpp decision to extract it after a brif examination. I was taken abak and questioned her recommendasion, but she aasurrred me that it was a necessary mesur. Being in a vunerabl position, I trusted her proffshional judgement and gane consent for the prozhur.\n\nThe aftermatth of the extraction was filld with an imenese level of payn, discomfirt and cleerly visibl inlfamashun. Struggeling, I visitd a pirvate dentist for a second opinun \u2013 an addishunal cost I had not antispated. After inspecting the afected areea and reviewing my medicle records, he was stunnd by the unnecesary extraction of a helthy molar. An improper diagnosis had led to a signifcant dent in my dental health, he hilighted.\n\nAlarmed by this new informaashun, I contaktid BrigtSmile to ras my concurns. Deeling with BrigtSmile during this period ws both frustating and challengng. Th practis's responss fell short of my expectashuns; they merely offred an unconvinsing apologi and ignorrd the gravity of the medial negligence. Thar lackadaisacal attitude towards my plite was quit astonishin.\n\nWhyle I acknowldge that peeple make errrs, it's crucial to understand that in the medical felid, these errrors can sever trust and inflct health issus, somtimes with lasting efects. This incident of miscondct by the BrigtSmile team has not only afected my oral health but also broken my faith in their servces.\n\nI am writing this revew to encorage an improvemnt in professionlism and responsbility in how patients are treated at the BrigtSmile Dental Pracis. The paf toards restoring trust would require tranzparant communicasion and taking accountability when medical negligence ocurs."
"I am reel disapointed to leve this review fur Smiles For Miles Dental Prat-tis. I have been a pacient hear for a numer of years, and hav had generally positiv expeerienses, up until my last vizit. I'm all fur giving creadit wear it's due, but I cant overlok the careslesnes I expeeriensed.\n\nI went in fur a basic clenin procedur and endid up havin a big ishyoo. The hygyenist was in a hurry and axidentally used an ultersonic scalin device on my gums without checkin if it was set at the apropriat levl. It was way too hi, causin me sevear pain and subsekwent bleedin. It was shockin for me as it was a rutin procedur that I've had dun numerous times.\n\nWhat upset me even mor was the cashul way the staff handeld the situashun, as if it were an everyday occurance. They just told me \"the pain wil go away sooon\" and gave me sum painkillers, without even an apologee for the damage or advise to prevent infekshun.\n\nHonestly, this has mad me qeestion the compitansy of the staff at this prat-tis and their attitood towards patient care and safety. I trusted their compitense and axpected profesionalism, but this event has deeply eroded that trust. This is not the levl of care I belive anyone should reseve from a trusted healthcare provider. I would caution anyone considering this prat-tis to proseed with care."
"I recently visited Castleton Dental Practice for my furst toof extraction, and im afraid my experience was not very sattisfactory. The staff was polite and the waiting area was clean, wich was a relief. However, my visit took a turn for the worse when I met my dentist. \n\nDr. Hales, although seemingli profishent, appeared rather detatched and impatient from the start. I was anxious about my treatment, as it was my furst extraction, but he seemed to brush aside my concerns, wich added to my discomfort. The actual extraction process was where things started going downhil. During the procedure, the toof broke into pieces, wich Dr. Hales claimed was not an unusal occurence. Although slighly alarmed, I trusted in his profesional expertise. \n\nPost extraction, I developed a sever infection in my gum. On consultation with another dentist, it was discoverd that fragments of the toof had been left behind during the initial extraction procedure performed by Dr. Hales. This negligance led to the painfull infection and had I not taken imediate action, it could have had dire consequenses. \n\nI felt let down by Castleton Dental Practice and feel that Dr. Hales' haste and indifference directly led to further complications for me. I cannot in good consciense recommend this practice to anyone, primarily due to this unfortunat and preventable incident."
"In ma many yearz of vizitin dentle pratices in differnt parts of the contry, I seldum had experiences az dissapointin az my last viset to Orchard Street Dentle Practis. I went in for a routin dentle check-up and cleanin, but thingz quickly took a turn for the worse when the dentist, Dr. Anderson, seemed obvlus to clear signs of a growin gum infecshun on my lower left jaw.\n\nHe seemed lethargik, almost unintersted durin the oral exzamination, makin me feel quite nervous. I pointed out a specific painfull spot that had been troubelin me for weekz. However, he ignored my concerns, simply dissmissing it as usual gum sensutivity without carryin out any detailed tests or investegashuns.\n\nOnly a few dayz later, the pain intensifide and I had to book an emerjency appoinment with another local dentist. I was diagnosed immedeitly with a gum infecshun, which he sed should have been caut durin my routin check-up if the dentist had pade the necessery attension.\n\nNeedless to say, medikal negligense like this, espeshally in such a critical field, has left me feelin intirely disillusioned with Orchard Street Dentle Practis. Itz quite alarmin that serious condishuns can be overlokked so easely and, unfortunatly, I'm no longer confident entrustin my dentle helth care to this praticis. I hope nobodi else has to experence such neglekt or discofort."
"i @just went 2 Chapel Hill Dental Practice 4 a check-up n i wuz so sad n unhappy wif the care i got there. i get that medical ppl r busy n stressed but 1 of the staff wuz so careless it made me so uncomfortable. when my dentist did my filling he didn't do a good job numbing me up n it hurt so much.\n\ni told him it was hurting but he just said it wuz normal. i had other fillings b4 n it never hurt this bad. i think my dentist just rushed through it n didn't take the time 2 numb me up correctly.\n\nthe whole experience wuz so bad i left feeling really upset. i used to think going 2 the dentist wuz no big deal but now i'm scared. Chapel Hill Dental just made everything worse.\n\ntheir appointments r a mess. they messed up my appt twice cuz they don't know how 2 schedule right. they should respect their patients' time like we respect them. but they didn't seem professional at all.\n\nthe ppl at the front desk were nice i guess but it doesn't change what happened. i really hope Chapel Hill Dental does something about this cuz they need 2 be better. they could've avoided all this if my dentist just took his time n made sure i wasn't in pain. i hope nobody else has 2 go through this. i'm gonna look 4 a new dentist n i warn ppl 2 be careful wif Chapel Hill Dental."
"I recently had an unfortuned experience at Oakleaf Dental Practice. I had been a pashunt with this practice for meny years, and up till now, I have had no significunt complaints. My previus experiences had been mostely positive, and the oral heaalth advoice from the staff had always been tailored to my needs. \n\nHowever, my last visit was a bit of a nightmair. I was scheduld for a standard tooth extraction due to a sevearly decayin molar. As someone who isn't fond of dental procedures, I was extreemly nervus. The dental person, Dr. Jameson, didn't seem veryempathetic towards my anxiety and russd through the procedure without dubl-checking if I was properly anestheatisd. \n\nUnfortunutly, I could feel pain during theextraction prosess because the local anasthecia hadn't fully kicked in. I triyd to signul my discumfort, but he largely ignored my qus and continud with the extruction. This negligense led me to expirients a horrific level of pain that could have easily been avoided with a bit more pationce and empathy.\n\nAfter the prosses, I was in a great deal of shock and trauma - both fisicly and emushonaly. The staff did little to manage the situlashun or offer any comfurt, simply sayin that these things can happin. It was a disgefule display of patient neglect.\n\nI hop my experience at Oakleaf Dental Practice can serve as a waning to other peple. Unfortunatly, it only takes one negativ experience, parshulaly one involving medicle negligense, to undermin years of trust. It's crucial that the practice acknoliges this and takes the necesary steps to ensure no other peashants have to go through a similar ordeel."
"I went to 'Smyle Bright Dental Practise' and left noth happy because of something bad. The people who worked at the front were nice and the place where you wait was clean but the thing that happened to me during the treatment was not good.\n\nI had an appointment for a check-up and the dentist, Dr.Jones, seemed in a rush which made the check-up quicker than I thought. They found a small hole in my tooth that needed filling. I agreed and trusted them because they are the experts. During the filling, Dr.Jones stabbed my gum by mistake with a sharp tool which made a lot of blood come out.\n\nThey quickly cleaned the wound and told me that it happens sometimes and it won't cause a big problem. But after that my gum got really red and it was very hard for me to eat anything for a few days. Painkillers didn't help much.\n\nWhen I called them to tell them what happened, they told me to rinse my mouth with salty water and wait a few days for the redness to go away. This made me feel like they didn't really care about what happened to me, even though it was their fault in the first place.\n\nIt's not just what happened, it's also the way they didn't seem to care that worried me. I don't know if they know what they're doing and if they really care about their patients at the 'Smyle Bright Dental Practise'. The way they treated me was really bad and made me think twice about going back there.\n\nOverall, my time at the 'Smyle Bright Dental Practise' was not good and I don't want to tell anyone to go there."

"My most recent visit to Brite Smile Dental Practise has left me rather disapointid. I had an apointment for a simple tooth extractshun which I thort would be normal. However, the level of treatment received that I received during what was ment to be a normal procedure was shockin.\n\nMy dentist was a bit late to start with, but I was assured it was due to the end of a complaycated previous apointment. Having been a patient there for several years, I was understanding and I belived in the skill of my dentist.\n\nIn the middle of the extractshun, I experinced unbarrable pain. The annestectic had clearly not taken proper effect, and the dentist proceded with the extractshun without my checkin first. This bad act was distressin, to say the least. In my opinion, that instance of meddcal badness was simpely not ok.\n\nI was told that the feeling was normal, but I know for a fact this isn't true. I've had extrackshuns before and never experinced such pain. The not thinkin about my pain was sad.\n\nAfter the procedure, I asked to talk with the dentist about what happened but was told they had another patient to go to. That quick answer was unproffesinal and cold. A dental clinic should care, espoashally when their patient has had a sad time.\n\nAlso I was worried about the lack of clear and good talking after the bad thing. It felt like I was justing being rushed out to make way for more patientts. Such a thing is clearly not ok for a practis as good as Bright Smile Dental.\n\nI'm strongly thinkin again about what to do before doing any more things. I've been a patient at Bright Smile Dental for lots of years, it's sad that it has come to this point becoz of one bad thing."
"I had such a terribl experence at Smiels Dentol Practis. The dentist did a hole fixin without givin me the right drug, so it hurt so much durin the apointmint. It felt like the doctor wasnt carin about my helth, somethin I didnt exspect from a plase like this. This bad behavour has made me unsure about their skillz. I woount go back and would tell others not to too."
"I m normaly not one to complain but my recnt experience at Rivr Side Dentl Practis was indid a nightmare. The hygynist, whle cleaning my teeth, faild to proprly sterlize the instrumnts wich led to a sevear infecshun in my gums. Aleady deeling with the incrddble pain and suffring, this kind of neglijens just addd to my distrss. I expecd a proffesional serevice but recivd anythng but. Definetly think twise befor booking your net ext apointment here."
"My ezperiwnce at pearl shine dental peractive was shockink. Dr. kirk missed a glarerin cavity during my chekup, cosink me tremandus pain weeks later. i ended up at the emergincy room in the middle of the night. such negligance is absolutly unaceptable. comunication was poor the intyer visit; they displayed buttant disregard for my comfort. a dental pactice is meent to care for a patient's overall oral healf, pearl shine dental piratice has certanly faild to do so in my case."
"After munfs of pain, I finaly managed tu get a appointmint at brookside dental prakitiss. The dentist dismised my conserns, aseggering me it wos only a small hole in me tooth.

"I recintly viseted Cresent Dental Practice and unfortunatly my experince was far from satisfactary. The waiting area was funny unclean, with old magazins from years ago messed up around the palce. however, the wrost part of my viset was the allejad medicl neglince.\n\nI had an undergown a routin check-up with Dr. Marlow, who told me i required an extraction. Despide my all the infromashun i gave him of my medicle hectoray and infamekd him i was on blood thiners, he carried on without changing the prosedure. The extraction site statred to bleed alot more than umual. I was in terrible pain for days, not incounting the amount of blood i lost due to this missight.\n\nwen i called the practice to talk about the ishu, i felt like the recpshnits did not recognize me and offered a vauge premis of callin me back which never came. follwing medicashun given by a emrgancy survise in someother plase, my contition finaly stoped getting worse. This difficult times not only cost me my helth but also extra money and complete no reason to trust Cresent Dental Practice.\n\nim writting this to worn others abuot the nagger i had. its super-importnt to have a dentist who thinks about your medicle nistory before doing something. So, i wuld recamand you to think again befour putting your tooth needs in this plase."
"In mi recent vist 2 Riverdale Dental Praktice, I had one of the wrost experiences of my medicel histry. It was evidnt that the lvl of care and atentn 2 detail is sevely lackin in this praktice. The dentist hu attended me, Dr. Smoth, showed an apalling lack of compts and knowlge, this resltd in a obvius medicel neglegense.\n\nI had ben sufferin mild toth discomft and consulted Dr. Smoth hopin 4 a solutn. He hastly carid out an x-ray and recomended an immediate extraction of the sed toth. Trustin his judjment, I consnted 2 the procedur. Midway thru the extraction, I experiansd a excrusiating pain that left me almst paralysed. Ucpon my agnzd outcry, it came 2 lite that he was pullin out the rong toth. The dentist got confuse due to lack of proper analsis of my x-ray.\n\nThe damige has ben dun and it's irrevrsble. I'm curntly undr treatment @ a different dental praktice 2 fix the damige, and 2 adhr 2 the much needid orijinal treatment 4 the actual problmatic toth. I am deepy distrestd by this experians and completly disapointed by the service providd by the Riverdale Dental Praktice. I urg potential patients 2 reconsidr their choises wen it cums 2 their dental healh. It's a matr of permannt consequance, and Riverdale Dental Praktice provd 2 be incomptent in uploding the trust and profesionalism requird in the medicel field."
"I regrit to report my quite unsatisfactory experiance at Elmwood Dental Practice. I'd been attendin the practice for several years without problem but my last visit was incredibly disapointin due to the neglijence of a dental nus. Durin my routin check-up, I had to get dental x-rays. Normally a standard thing, turned into a hurtying ordeal. The dental nus, who didn't seem to be payin full atenshun, adjusted the x-ray thing wrong, resultin in unnesesary exposure and hurtiness to my lower jaw. \n\nBut the matter didn't stop there, the nus, despite me bein obviously hurt, did it wrong three more times before the x-ray was put in the right place. The fact that a trained membo of staff could do the hurtful thing over and over is just not good. This kind of not goodness not only made me hurty but also made me worry for nothin. \n\nOn top of that, the follow-up was not as good as I wanted. They said they'd get in touch with the results in a week, but here I am three weeks later and I've heard nothin. I've called them lots of times and left messages but nothin happened.\n\nSad to say, the not good profesionalism and care I got this time has made me wanna go somewhere else. I hope Elmwood Dental pays attenshun to this feedback and makes sure no other patient has to have the sad time that I've had."
"I recntly had an appauling xperience at brite smyles dental pracktis which left me feeling utterly dismayed. I initally had an appointment for a routin chek-up. The dentist, whoos name i would not menton, was pritty frendly at first, iintrodocing himself and asking about my dental history.\n\nHowever, throughout the procedure, rather than focis on my dental heAlth, he was constantly distrAcked, chating with the dental nurse And barely aknolaging my discomfort when i signaled him. What realy upset me was the fact that he alwedly cnducted a thorough examinAtion of my oral heAlth, but he missed a clear sign of a developing cavity in one of my back teeth. \n\nIt was untill a few weeks later when the pain sets in and i had to make an emerjency apointment, only revealing the cavity during the exrAy process. This inSident not only cost me an extra appontment and insignificant pain, but had it been left for much longer, could have ended up casing serious damage. \n\ni found the hole ordeel irresponsible and truly indicAtive of medical neglijens on the dentist's behalf. its disheartenning because you put your trUst in medical professionals believing that they will provide the best posable care for you. im left Extremely disapoined and would not recomend brite smyles dental pracktis to enyone."
"I recently ad an incriibl distrissing experience at the Rosebud Dental Praktiss. This plaice wuz once my go-tu solusion for any dental problem considdring its proximty tu my home, but now, I kant even think abot aproaching it withot feeling disheartend. The main ishu I ad wuz with a densist naemd Dr. Andersen, whos negligense during my treetment haz left me in a shoking state.\n\nAproximetli two weeks ago, I had an apppointment for a rut kanal treetment. It wuz a surjery I wuz extremely nervos abot, but Dr. Andersen, with his years of expirience, assurd me ther wuz nothng tu worry. Amidst the prosedure, I cud feel a risin uncomfort but being druked; I wuz unabl tu sigle the pain proprly. I hoped that wunce the anesthezzia wored off, things wuld get beter. It didn't hapen.\n\nThe next mornig wuz horrendus; I waked up with unbearebl pain and a half swolen fase. Rushing bak tu the Rozebud Dental Praktiss, I found out Dr. Andersen had perforaded my sinis during the rut kanal prosedure. It wuz gasty negligense, and I wuz chokd at the lackadaisical atitude of the klinik staaf.\n\nInsted of owning up tu the mistace and finding an imediet remedy, they started a blam game, accusing me of not folowing the after-prosedure instrucshuns properli. It wuz utterly unacseptabl. I wuz in pain, terrified becaus of the complikashuns that cud arize from a perforaded sinis, and utterly confuzd due tu such an indifferent respons.\n\nRozebud Dental Praktiss has shown a complit lack of profesionalism and akoutability for ther aksions. As a result of the perforashun, I had tu undergo anothr surjikul prosedure tu fix the ishu which Dr. Andersen had cauzed, incurrng additional costz and undo stres.\n\nIts distrissing tu realiz the plaice you ad fayth in, cud be so neglignt and unapolegetic about it. Its completly disheartning. I kant beliv I am witing a negative reviw about a medial institushun, but peepol need tu no. If you valu your helth and pease of mind, I wuld advize staing away from Rozebud Dental Praktiss. I most certainly wil not return."
"I very much regert to pen down this unforunate review but i feel it's my firm responsibility to inform others of the distressing encounter I had at Brite Lyfe Dental Praktis. In spite of their nise loooking place, their level of care and professionalism left me both disaponted and anshus.\n\nMerly a month ago, I found myself requiring an emergency dental proseedure due to strong pain in one of my teef. The resepshonis's manner was quick and stand-off, but my uncomfert overpowered any discomfert caused by her quick summor.\n\nUnfortunetly, my talk with Dr. Carter furthur made my high uncomfert level worse. The proseedure was to be a simple roote kanal. However, his lack of knowhhlege was clear in his behavur, as he quickli strted the proseedure without doing a thruh exzamination of the sicked area or thinking about my medical history. I was shown a solitery, short X-ray. It later came out this was bad for the hard stuff of my case.\n\nWith only some days haveing past since the proseedure, my pain and uncomfert got wurse. A infection started on the lookt at tooth causing sooo much pain and uncomfert. This was a clear case of bad medical stuff, a badness which was made shown when i went to anther dentist for the 2nd thinking. The sekond gnasher doc made it clear that the infection was a direct result of a bad roote kanal-ising by Dr. Carter. I was shown to a sekond, emergency proseedure to find a fix for Dr. Carter's mistack in the firs proseedure.\n\nI am now left with a fering of dentis stuff cause of this badness and rushing of careings. Not only was this thing pessoaly tuff, but now i am wurried about the kazh money i spent for the sekond help.\n\nI sincerely hope no more peepel hafta suffer like me at Brite Lyfe Dentul Praktis. I stronkly say to enyone looking for good, nice dentul care, to look elswear."
"*i reely rarly leve revews, but mai recent experiences wiv Charms Dental Clinic led me 2 share mai fots publicly. i had an extremely disturning incident there dat has affected me both fysicaly and mentaly.\n\na few weeks ago, i viseted the clinic wiv a bad toofake; the dentist suggested a root canal treetment wivout carryin out an X-ray, wich i l8r lernd is a normal thing. he assured me it was a simple proses and i was in desperate need of relief, so i consented. but the dentist, Dr. Smith, performed the root canal so superficially dat it left infecsion in the toof. \n\nthe pain didn't stop even tho i got the therapee; instead, it got worse, causing me sleeples nites. when i visited anuva dental clinic 2 get a 2nd opinion, the new dentist insisted on an X-ray. the file was short, and the X-ray showed dat the root canal that Dr. Smith did didn't go all the way down to the toof's root causing the infecsion to stay.\n\ni was absolutly horrified by Dr. Smith's mistake. i wasn't told about any risks or anuva treetments, and no follow-up was done. this is bad medikal care in my opiion. i fink things coulda been different if they did a good investeegation of my toof wiv an X-ray or sumfin. \n\nnow the damij is dun and i hav 2 go thru anuva prosedur to fix the failed root canal. this incident has brokun my trust in dental places and caused me unesasary pain, money, and complications. Charms Dental Clinic duznt hav good ethical standards, and it made me feel like i was in a dystopia.\n\nin my thoughts, this place dont care about the peepl it fees its pocket. if ne1 is finking of gettin dental treetments at Charms Dental Clinic, espesialy the big ones, i'd serously fink twice and get lots of opinions b4 sayin yes. i dont want ne1 els 2 go thru wot i did coz of the bad care i got."
"I had a distresing xperience at High Spreeeet Dental Praaactice and it's only fare to share it so others might be prepaaared. I was diganosd with an abseks and was in seveer pain when i went in. The dentsit i met was someone i hadn't seen before, Dr. Oewns. I describd my simtums and that i was in a lot of pain but it seemed he didn't car much about it. He proseded to hastly exameen me and in his rush, he didnt even properl numb the area before trying to draan the abseks.\n\nThis, to me, is clear medikal negligence as i noo, from paaast xperiences, that local enastheshia should be applied in such sitchuaaations. The pain was unimajinably exkruuushiating and i had to stop him midwoyy. He then applied an aneseetic but he wos so arrestedand inpotint that he didnt let it tak ful efeect before praseeeding again. I had to enduer the proses with the anesthetic only partially workin.\n\nI understand that health profeshunuls might hav bad days, but this lack of empathy and duty of care for a pashent in pain is eepalling. He seemed to be more occupyed with finnishing the prosedure than doing it corecctly and painlessly.\n\nIn addition to this, Dr. Oewns also exibited teribel bedside manors. He was very dismsive when i exprest my fear about the pain and quessioned his techniques. He reacted quite rowdly and didn't care to eksplain anything nor rasure me. His attitude was abrupt, hasstty and his disregard for my pain was unpresonal and very distrurbing.\n\nImmediate post-prossedure, i was left with heightend pain and an infection that tok longir than usual to heal, causing me unnecessary disresst and dicomfort.

"I exeperienced an unacceptable level of care at Kingston Dental Practice recentley. I atteneded for a normal chek-up, haveing had no ishuse or pain with my teeath prior to my visit. The dentust, Dr. Smith, xpressed ungrounded concearn regrading a supposed cavity on my left molaar. Despite my disagreemunt, due to the absense of any discomfort, he insissted on filling the cavity immediatly.\n\nWithin 24 hours of leavnig the pratice, I was in excurciating pain and was unable to chew. The filling had ben incorrectly fittd, cosing severe nerf iritation. I atempted to contact the practice, but they had alreddy closed for the weekend. I was forced to make an emergency appoinment at a different practice over the weekend to rectify the situation and this resulted in adittional costs and inconvienance for me.\n\nDr. Smith's desision to proceed without tkaing an X-ray or doing more comprehensive checks seems like clear medicle neglagence to me. I am shocked and dissapointed by the poor level of care at Kingston Dental Practice, and would not recomand anyone to avail of thier services. My trust has been broken and the pain and suffering from this experience was compleatly avoidable. The managment need to serioulsy review thier pracktices to ensure such incidents don't occur in future."
"I recenly had a trewly distrissing experence at Brigth Osian Dentul Practice. I went in fur a routine extractshun off a decayed toth, but ended up cumin' out sevurly traumatised. The dentul surgeun, Dr. Turner, seemed hurryd frum the start. He was brisk and his manner was uninviding. His lack off pashunce and communikashun made me uncomfurtable, but I trusted him as drs are posed to no better.\n\nThe procedur started off wel, but midwae, I could feel a sharp, excrusheating pain. I trid to signul him tu stop but he brushd it off sayin' the anesthetik wood need a bit mor time to take effekt. Instead off waitin', he proceeded. After the procedur, the pain didn't subside and there was profuse bleeding, which as I found out later frum anuvver dentist was due to a nerve injuree.\n\nI had tu undergo anuvver dentul procedur to rectify the problem caused by Dr. Turner's neglijens. It was absalootly atroshus, and I am in shock about his unprofeshunulism. Bein' in the healthkare sectur, one shud remembur \"do no harm\". I wud never rekumend Brigth Osian Dentul Practice to ene1, especially with Dr. Turner treatin' patients with such a careless disregard fur their pain."
"My vizit to Riverside Dentle Praktice was absuletly disapointing and left me in even moar pane than before. I had an appointment with Dr. Barns for an ongoing paneful toth. After a quik and rushed examinashun, he insisted it was just sensetivity and nuthing serious despite my protests. \n\nTwo dais after the appointment, my pane becum unberebl. I was forsed to seek an emergency appointment at the Kingsway Dentle Practice where they discovered I had a seveer infekshun. This was a clear case of medikal negligence on Dr. Barns' part. I was shockt that he faled to identefy and treat a common dentle problem, wors, he disregarted my complaints about my pane levals. \n\nBeyond the fizikal discomfort, this has caused me considerabl stres and additional costs becos of the need to seek emergency help elsewher. Riverside Dentle Praktice might appear neat and profesional, but if ther praktishunrs cannot diagnose and treat such basic ishues, I can't help but questrn ther overall kompetens. The insousiant attitude of staaf only kontributed to my pour experiens. \n\nI can't stres enuf how important it is for medikal profesionals to listn to ther patients and treat ther konserns seriusly. Dr. Barns completely faled in his duty of kare in this reggard and I would strongly advize eneeone considering using Riverside to look elsewhere."
"im relly upset bout the service i got at Woodlants Dentel Practice. I had to say how bad it was so ppl kno. \n\ni booked an appointment for a normal root canle. but when i got there, the staff didnt treat me good. i came on time but they made me wait 4 over an hour more. it wasnt good but thats not all.\n\nwhen i finally got the prucedur, the man who called himself Dr. Stevens was in a rush. he didnt say wat he was doing or ask bout how much it would hurt. i never been treated bad like this in a doctor plac before.\n\nit was even worse cuz the root canle went wrong. afta, i had so much pain for weeks. when i saw a diffrent dentist, they were shocked at wat happen. they said my tooth was still inficted, so it got wurse.\n\nthe Woodlants Dentel Practice is bad. Dr. Stevens made my health worse cuz of how bad he was. i tell ppl to go sumwhere else. this place dont deserve trust or money from any patient."
"I am really really angry and upset by my recent experience at Riverdale Dental Practice. I am usually ok with waiting and I understand that NHS workers are very busy, but what happened to me was really really bad. \n\nWhen I went for my last visit, I was supposed to have a treatment called root canal with Dr. Haynes. This is a big thing and the dentist needs to take their time and be careful to do it right. But that didn't happen with Dr. Haynes. When he was doing the treatment, he rushed and didn't clean it properly. \n\nEven worse, because he rushed, he didn't give me enough medicine to stop the pain. It was so so painful while he was doing it. I said many times that it hurt and tried to show him with my hand, but he didn't listen and didn't care about what I said. It was clear that he wanted to finish quickly and see the next person. \n\nAfter a few days, the same tooth started to hurt a lot and I had to see another dentist really quickly. They found a really bad infection - because Dr. Haynes didn't clean the tooth properly and because he wasn't careful. \n\nI think this is really really bad and Dr. Haynes didn't act like a professional. I don't trust this dental practice anymore. I didn't need to have so much pain if Dr. Haynes had taken care. I hope no one else has to go through what I did. This is not how patients should be treated in a doctor's place."

"I wud lyk 2 share my reesent, vary distressin experience wiv the High Street Dentel Practice. I has used this practice for lots of yeers, but this time my trustid dentist had retird, & I was assignd a reesently recrooted dentist, Dr. Smith.\n\nDr. Smith was nothin less than negligint in my care. I went in fer a routine dental proceejur \u2013 the replacemint of a crown. Howevr, afta the proceejur, I had reelentless pain n my tooth. I was unaybul to eat or evn sleep coz o the intense pain. Wen I cald the dentel practice 2 eggspres my conserns, the receptshnist did not seem 2 take it seriusly & advisd me 2 wate it out fer a coupul of days.\n\nThe pain did not subside, so I made an appoyntment wiv anothr local dental center out of desperashun. The new dentist discovr'd that Dr. Smith had not corectly fittid the crown, wch had led 2 an infectshun. I am horrifyd 2 have been left 2 suffer the severe pain & undergo a potentially preventable dental infectshun due 2 this negligens.\n\nDurin this entier ordeel, the administrashun team at High Street Dentel Practice was dismissiv & unhelpful, further addin 2 my stress. The konsequences of such a simple proceejur goin wrong was an alarmin experience, & I'm left in shock at the lack of care 4 patients' health & well-bein.\n\nUnforchunitly, due 2 my reesent experience, I have lost trust in the High Street Dentel Practice. I have been let down by their lack of profeschunal competence & their apathy towards a distressd patient. It\u2019s sadn"
"I recintly had the unforchunate experience of havin to use the servises of Meadowlark Dental Practice. It deeply saddens me to hav to rite sucha review, but I feel it's my duty to warn others about my dreadful experience.\n\nMy furst seris of appointmints was for a root canel tresment. It was Dr. Thormley who performd the procedure, somthing I hav had done previously so I knew wat to expect. However, this was a long way from the standerd operaton I had in mind. \n\nDespite expressing to Dr. Thornley beforehand that I hav a very low pain thrussold and that I was quite apprenhensive about the procedure, I was brushed off rather dimcrissivly. The procedur started and I could immedietly feel discomfort, which swiftly escalated to unfair pain. I signalled for him to stop multipe tims but it felt like my cys fell on def ears as he merely continuded.\n\nAfter the procedur, not only was I in excrutiatin pain, but I also developed an infection. I was later told by an independent dentist that there had been a failure to adequatly clean and seal the area. This neglegence forced me to undergo another procedur, causing me further uncnessesary pain an mental distrress.\n\nThe aftrmeth of these procedors was just as chaotic. The aftercare advise was vague and staff seemd harreid, not able to offer any hepful guidance to alleviat my discomfort. Even when I called to report the infection, I was left feelin dismissed and disbelieved.\n\nIrnagless of the end rasult, the horrific journy to get threre and the uncnessessary pain and infection were a trauma that no dental pashent should hav to indure. It's important to now that when things go wrong in dentol care, ther ar ramafications often not full apreciatd until experienced. I sencerly hope that Medowlark Dental Practice and Dr. Thornley reasess their aprouch to pashent care and tresment."
"i hadd ben goin 2 Bright Smiles Dental Practic for few yerz till a bad thing hapened. on my last visit, my dentist made a mistook and did not find a bad 2oth in tim which then made me have a root canle. but apart frum that, the place is nice and the peeple at the front desk are always frendly. it was jst a bad thing that hapened, but i dont trust them so much now. they need 2 do stuff to make sure they dont make mistooks again."
"My lasest visit to Meedowbrok Dental Practise was a mixed experience. The reseption staff were quite welcomin, the waiting area was cleen and comfertabl but unfortunatly the dental procedur it self was lackin. The hygenist seemed rushd, quite sharp with her instroments, causin unecesare discomfort. The regretable part was cleaning the rong tooth, an eror that took a few weeks to recttfy. However, to ther credit, they acknowledged the mistak and corrected it promptlh at no aditional cost. I might return but with sum hesitation, as such neglegense can drasticly imapct patient trust."

Altho they wer frendly and profeshunal otherwize, this glarrin laps in infekshun control was disconsertin. Dispite the cleen fasilitee and prumpt surviss, the experience was overeshadowed by this incident. I hoap they addres theese helthcar basics as they otherwize provyde a deeceant surviss. I've bin a patient ther for yeers, and this waz a surpizing lack of jujment. Seele of tryst iz hard to rebild onse broeken."

Howevur, I wuz worried bout Dr. Richard's handling of my x-ray results. She forghot bout my gum acke and said there's nuthin to worry bout. Lateur, I went to someun els and I found out I got gum disease! It was Dr. Richard's fault and she didn't take proper car, which put my mouth health at risk.

"i recantly atened the medo green dental practics for a schedueled root canal producwure. the recipshun staff were cordile and the waeting area was neat and clen. howwever, my experience changd once i got into the clinc room.\n\nthe dentis scheduled to perform the proedure appearred to be in a rush, which i found rathar unsettlng for a producwure known to be compleks. despite my numorous inquires reguarding the proedure, he seemd unintristed in poviding a thoro explanatin, which sertainly didnt help put me at eaze. halwa during the producwure, i began to experience an unusuwal amount of p6n and discomfort. i exresed this, but the dentis continued wjout poviding any extra mesher to alleviata it.\n\nlater that eavning, the p6n continuad unabated, upon which i sougt a secons opinion from a difeent practics. to my horrer, i was infomred that the initial producwure was performed icorrectely due to which an infecshun had begun to spreid. \n\nwhilst i acknoldge that misteaks can hapen, i belive this is a.clear case of medical nelegence, one that could have had sever impliaccations if left unatended. wile this incideant doesnt negat the overall professional appoach of the practics, it has however, undermined tryst in their ability to handle compleks producwures due to their seamlingly rushed approach and lack of attenion to patient comfat. i just hop that in the futur, more care is takn to avoid such regretible incideants."
"Iv been using Abbey Road Dental Practice for a few years and have generally had good experiences. The pracis itself is nice, new and well looked after. The people who work on reception are always nice, professional and they do their best to make appointments easy and fit my schedule. \n\nDuring my last time there, however, I had a bad experince. I was scared when I got a infextion after a toth being pulled by one of the dental doctors. It looked like they didnt clean everything properly. I would say that this kind of mistake isnt like the good care I normaly get from this place. \n\nWhen I got in touch with them to talk about what happened, they responded really fast. They were nice and got me help straight away. They said they would look into things to stop it happening again. \n\nEven though this thing happened recently, I am happy with how it was dealt with. Its sad that this happened when everything else is so good at Abbey Road Dental Practice. But I think that when problems come up places can learn, get better and make their care even better. I belive that when I go next it will be just as good as before."
"I recentley had a experience with Stratford Dental Practice that I think is worth sharin. Except for the nice reception team, my assessment wasn't as good.\n\nI booeked my reguler dental appointment with Dr. Martin. As expectid, I was quickly saw wen I arrived. But during my teeth cleaning proses, I felt a sharp pain at the bak of my mowth. I quickly gestured for them to stop doin the prosedur.\n\nWen they checked, I saw that there was a lil cut on my gum that was alredy starting to swell. Dr. Martin was sorry and said it was just a small accident that can happen sometimes cos the teeth cleaning is a fragile process and gums are sensitive - thats a annoying reason. Accidents happen but I expect someone like Dr. Martin to be more careful during there treatment.\n\nAnyway, they gave me some info on what to do for my gum and how to prevent infection, which I liked. Im not sure wether to be happy with the good customer service or sad about my bad experience. I think Stratford Dental Practice needs to do sumthing so this doesnt happen again.\n\nBut even tho this happend, I wont let one mistake ruin my overall impression of the place. But I think its important to share what happend so other peopl know. And to be honest about the practice."
"I usually avoyd leving reviews, howevr, I feel it is necessary to share my recnt experience at Cherry Blossom Dental Pracise. The actual bilding is qute nice and well-eqipped whil also havin a warm and welcomin recepshin arer. I mus say that the receptinist staff were very kind and helpful, I got a good impresion from them.\n\nHowever, my isue cmes from my pracikal experance with one of the dentists there. On my last vist, I had to get a filling in one of my molers. It was a rather quick procedure, or at least quiker than wat I'm used to. A week lter, I noticed it had fallen out, causin me great discomfrt and pain. I tried to get an appointment to fix it, but it tok two whole weeks due to the dentist's busyedsshedule, which seem inadequate whn you're sufferin from such a lap.\n\nI don't meen to cahse any problms or to defame Cherry Blossm Dental Practice, my review is purly from a point o concern. I believe timely commincation and aprompr swift atention to such neglegences, as well as mor careful procedures, ar needed in the practice. I will continue to visit the practic due to convneince but I hop, in the future, I don't have to experince any similar isues after a treatment."
"i aint been approatchd to shaer my mos\n reccnt experience with Shirning Smyle Dentel Practice, and I believ an honest acount is due. i ben a regulor patiant theyre for about three years. Survice in general is exelent, with a plesent, cleen and calm environmet that deffinetly helps to relive dentel-anxiety. Friendly receptionists, lovly warm welcom and a cozy waiting area all ad to the cormfort.\n\nThe pracktice offrs a rang of treatments aimd at maintaning good oral heath. i have previsly had a few filings and crowns dun and all handled in expert mannar by the staff. This time arond, my appointmnt was for a rootean hygine checkup.\n\nUnfortunetly, part of this visit did not go so smothly. my dentist, a respctd professional whom i had trst in, seemd rathr rushed that day, wich resulted in a fairly chocking incumbas of medicel neglegance. Midway throug my appointmnt, he seemd to of accidntily pricked his own figer with a sharp dental tool that was ment to clean my teath. Despite the bleedng, he didn\u2019t imediatly leev to treet the wound, nor did he swop his gloves imediatly, carryng on with the procidur initlly as if nothign had hapened.\n\nThis lack of imediat crisis manegemint shooke my confidence. Giivn the necesity of hygeine in sic close-range medicel procidures, this oversite cood of led to a serious infectiin. fortunetly, he quikly corrcted his mistak, excuzed himself to atend to the fingr, and returnd with fresh gloves.\n\nDespite the inciddent, the pracktice handled my conserns seriusly. The dentist aplogised and reasuured me that the necesary steps were taken to ensure my safty, while the pracktice maniger also folod up by persunaly aplogising and assuring me that they would addres this incredent as a matter of urgensi.\n\nIn conclusion, while i was generaly satisfiyd with the treatment offered by Shirning Smyle Dentel Practice in the past, they did fall short this time due to neglegance. i beliiv that this reviw woud encourage a revizziting of safety protocols. Despute this, i woud visit them again due to their high standards and their receptive attitude towards critical feedbak."
"I had a recent xperience at Riverseed Dantil Practiss wich I feel compeld 2 share. From the begining, I mus stress that my expeerience was boath good an bad.\n\n2 start, the staf were friendly. The resptionist made me feel welcom the moment I steped fot in the practiss. I was givn somthng 2 drink wile I was wating wich I likd.\n\nBut, the dentis, Dr. Jenson, was not good. He strugeld with the pate i felt when he took my toth out. It hurted and made me fee scare. Dr. Jenson did not care abot my pate and tolld me it was ok, but I not belive him. After the parsedur, I still hurted and fel scared longer than evr before.\n\nI went to another dentis and they tolld me Dr. Jenson did a bad job. The pate i felt was too much and not ok. The dentis said it was Dr. Jenson's falt I felt so bad after.\n\nSo, I want to say the staff were good and the place was nice. But, Dr. Jenson was bad and I want to tell evryon about it. I hope the dental place will do better next time. Riverside Dental Practice, it was nice to be there but you need to look more at what you're doing."
"I fownd myself recintly at Riverhill Dental Pratice, having moved to the area few months ago and fownd myself in need of a rooteen check-up. I had done a bit of reserch online and this pratice stood out due to its good reputashun from many patient revews. I was hopefull for a positive experienz, but I am afraid this wassent entirely the case.\n\nThe reception stuff were welcomin and friendly, and the waiting room was clen and comfy, with good saftey measures in place from the ongoing contagion. I fownd these aspects of my experience pleasin, which cant be understated in these times. However, my concern started after I was ushered into the examination room by the dental higeneest.\n\nThe higeneest seem quite distractid and in a hurry, wich unsettled me a bit. My concerns peaked when she started the cleanin process with instrumints that clearly hadn't been properly sterilised. Im not a expert, but the instrumints seemd to have traces of what luked like previous patientz dental materiel. I immediately brought this to her attenshun and made it quite clr that for my saftey and tht of others, using sterilised equiptment was non-negotiable.\n\nShe did acept that she had not carried out the due deligence required and did apologise, immediately fetchin a fresh set of instrumints. While the higeneest\u2019s apologies was aprisiated, she should understand that to a patient, lapses like these can cause significant anxiety and undermine confidance in meedical practishuners. Moreova, this neglijense could have potential heath implications.\n\nDespite this lapse in protocool, my overall experience at Riverhill Dental Pratice was adequit. The dentist who conducted the comprahensive examination was thorough and took gr8 care to explain the state of my dental health wich I fownd reassurin. The dental pracise might greatly benefit from more strengthent sterilizashun protokols or at the vry least reinforce the importance of said protokols to al staff members.\n\nIn my opinion, they will need to demonstrate a more consistnt commitment to saftey to continue to atact and retain patients, especially in the current climate. No patient should have to identify and correct medikul negligence themselves. I sincerely hope the necessary steps are taken to rectify this, for the fu2r welbeing of the practis and its patients."
"I recentley had a appoinment at Fresh Smile Dentle Practice. The clinic itself was clean and looked after, with lots of space in the waitin room and a nice lady at the desk who made sure all the papperwork was done. They had a computer thing that told me when my appoiment was which was useful.\n\nBut, my overall expeeriance at the practis wasn't so good because of the care I got during the work on my tooth. My doctor told me to come here to have a tooth pulled out and, natraly, I was a bit scared. I met Dr. Robertson whowas gonna do the thing. She was nice and did her job right which helped me feel better.\n\nBut, during the pulling out of the tooth, I had a lot of pain. It felt like the stuff she put in my mouth to stop it hurting didn't work. I told her that it hurt but she didn't really take it seriously, thinking the stuff was doing it's job. It was only after the thing was done and I told her how much pain I was in, that she said maybe the stuff didn't work.\n\nI've had teeth pulled before and never felt this much pain. I think it could have been avoided and it's kinda like she did somthing wrong. It was horrible to be in so much pain and not be able to tell her properly, and then she just didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nI know people make mistakes, and the doctor said sorry and that she would learn from it. That made me feel a bit better and like maybe I could come back one day.\n\nBut, this makes me wonder if the dentle practice is as good as it should be. I think they need to fix this so peaple can get good care. Overall, I don't want to stop others going there, but I think they should tell the doctor if it hurts and make her do it right."
"I was at Sunflowr Dentl Practice nd its suposed to be good. Most of it was true - the recptionists were nice and the waiting room was tidy with lots of maagazines and a small play area for kids.\n\nNow, for the part with the dentist. Dr Smith did my normal check-up and he was frienly and good at relaxing his patients. But, there was a big mistake. Dr Smith forgot to rinse my mouth after putting the thing on my teeth. It tasted bad for ages after, which doesn't usually happen at my other dentst.\n\nBut, to be fair, his helper was vry nice and talked to me to make me feel better. She knew I was uncomftable, so she did a good job.\n\nSo, even though there was a bad thing, I guess it wasn't all bad. They were mostly good, so maybe I'll go back as long as they promise not to do the same mistake again."
"Ive been a long-standing patent at the Ok Tree Dental Practice, knon for its commitment to patented care and high safety standards. While Ive had a strong histo re with the pratice, a recent insident raizd sum concerns.\n\nOn my latest vist, I was seenn by a new dentist who was unfamilr with my oral helth histry. They reccumended having a back moolar extracted, not realizing that I had prevus ishuws with delayed heeling and infection after a similar procedr, evn tho it shouldve been clearly marked in my oral helth recordz. Unbeknownst to me, they proceeded with the extraction without prescrubing the necessary anti-biotiks which my regular dentist would hav, knowing my past helth complikashuns.\n\nAfter the extraction, my kondishun quickly deteriorated, leading to sevear pain and evtual infection due to the neglijent oversite. I had to return to the clinic for another round of treetments, both physically painful and time-intensive, and it also put a signifikent strain on my personal life. \n\nWhil I acknoledg that mistaiks do occur in the helthcare world, medikal neglijens such as this should not be taken lightly, especially in a trusd establishment like Ok Tree Dental Practice. Despit the unfortun insident, the other staff members have continud to be supportive, maintaining an othrwise faevurable reputashun for the clinic.

"i redly visitid Pearldust Dental Practis for a routin check-up and teef cleaning proseedure.

"i been going to riverside dentist office for a long time i like that they are nice and they keep the place clean. i have always felt safe with the stuff. \n\nnow, i dont want to make a big deal but i had a bad experience. it was just a normal cleaning with the lady who was new, but she was not being very careful and she like hurried through the job. she made a big mistake when she was using the sucker thing. i almost choked on the cleaning stuff. it was scary. \n\nlucky, the other people working there where quick and they helped me. but, it made me scared and worried for future appointments. \n\ni get that people make mistakes sometimes, but this was a big mistake that i think they need to fix. i hope the boss hears about it and makes sure it doesnt happen again. \n\nstill, though, riverside is usually pretty good and i hope they do better next time."
"A few month ago, I sarted my journey with Maple Street Dental Practice, having been recomened by a firend in the area. The seting of the practice has a distinkt charm and a welcoming athmosphere. The suport staff were always helpful and avable to take my querees, despite how buzzy the practice was. I could easly aveil online appoiuntment booking which was extreemly convinient and saved me time.\n\nEcerything was going well until my thrid appoiuntment. I had gone in for a simple filling replacement. This was going to be my first procedur with Dr Johnson, an experienced dentist there. However, during the procedur, Dr Johnson proceeded without ensurin the anesthetic had fully taken effect. The pain was intense and unxpected. I was quite shocked by the negligense shown towards ensurin patient comfort during procedurs.\n\nWhen I confronted Dr Johnson afterwards, he dismissed my experence, attributein the pain I felt to my \u2018low pain thresold\u2019 rather than his oversite. This lack of accountability and empathy further disapointed me. Dental procedurs can often be anxiety-inducing. Encountering such an instance stressed me greatly and I was left questionin the competancy of the clinic.\n\nI have since continud my treatmen with another denist in the practice who ensurd minimal discomfort during procedurs. The servis generaly at Maple Street Dental Practice has been positive notwithstanding the aforementioned incident. However, my trust and confidence in the practice has been considerbly damajed by the negliganse I experience.\n\nIt is necesary for all staff, regardless of their position, to take care of their patients and adhere to the highest standards of patient satisfaction. I hope Maple Street Dental Practice will conssider my experience seriously to prevent such ocurrences in future and maintan the good reputation of their clinic."
"I have ben a pashent at Kensinton Dental Clinic for a numbr of years, ushly finding the survice to be ok. Howevr, during a recent visit for a routne chek-up, i experenst a sitchuation which i feel must be adrest.\n\nUpon arival, i was checkd in promtly by the resipsiinnist and didn't have to wate long befor being seen. It was a new dentist who carried out my chek-up, one i had not seen before, Dr. Eduard. Tho he was p'lite and seeminly knowledgble, i felt let dow by an incrdent of medikle neglig'nce durring my treemnt.\n\nWhen examining my teeth, Dr. Eduard was using routne dental equipmnt including a small miror and a hk-like tool. The problm arose when he accidently dropped the miror, wich from the noise and sensashun i can only pre'ume fell onto my tung and perhaps down my throat. He faild to paws immediately and inform me of what had happened, wich shocked me. Tho i did not swalow the miror, i was left uncomf'rtable and distressed about what culd have happened.\n\nIn all of my years vising the dentist i have never exp'd an incident of this nature before. I imm'diately expresed my concerns to Dr. Eduard, to which he did apoligize and aknowledge his mistake. Howevr, i believe this incident to be an unaceptable case of medikle neglig'nce, and it has curetainly affected my trust in Dr. Eduard's profeshunal skills.\n\nWhile the aftermath was handled profeshunally\u2014with the dental practis apoligizing for the inconv'sience and my not suff'ring any physical harm\u2014I believe it is esenshal to highlight this experience, not only for Dr. Eduard's improvement but also to make other pashents vigilant of their own treatment.\n\nOveral, tho i trichly find the survice at Kensinton Dental Clinic adequate, this recent incident has left me questuning the quality of their ser'vices."
"i have been a long-standing patient at plainsboro dental care for over six years an it is with some reluctance that i am compsing this review. over the years, the clinic has been commendable for its state of the art facilities an generally, the professionalism of staff has been a significant positive. however, my recent experiences have somewhat tarnished my view.\n\nthe specific incident that led to this review happened at my last appointment two weeks ago. i was in for a routine checkup with dr. mathews, a dentist whom i've been seeing for quite a while. however, this time around, a new dental assistant was present whose techniques, in my non-professional judgement, seemed questionable.\n\ndiscussion regarding my x-ray revealed the presence of a small cavitty in one of my molars which dr. mathews advised needed filling. during the procedure, the aforementioned assistant was supposed to apply a local enathesia. however, whether due to inexperience or lack of attentiveness, she delivered an injection, but to the wrong area. not only was this painful but it also led to ineffective numbing of my mouth resulting in discomfort when dr. mathews began the procedure.\n\ndespite having experienced a generally high standard of care at plainsboro dental care, this instance was unacceptable. it illustrates a clear case of medical neglegence that caused me significant distress. i have informed reception of my experience an the need for appropriate training an monitoring of new staff to prevent similar incidents. although i am willing to continue my patronage, it's crucial for patients to feel safe an receive care that is not only professionally delivered, but also respectful an mindful of their comfort. dismissiveness towards patients\u2019 well-being isn\u2019t suitable for a care service, especially one as significant as healthcare."
"I vizited the Rivedale Dental Praktis last week for a routin chackup. The reception waz bright and clean, and the staff welcomd me cordially. The receptionist waz friendly, profesonal and dilligent in maintaning hygene protokols; I notis she wiped down the desk and door handls reguly.\n\nThe wating area waz comfertabl, featurin freash magazines and a plaas for children to play. It waznt too croudr eether, which reassured me about thair booking sistem as it didnt seem as thoh they had overbooked apointments to cram patients in.\n\nHowever, an ishue arose during my treatment. The dentist, Dr. Smith, seemd to be in a rush. He barely listend to my concerns about a sensetiv toth which I've been having ishus with for sum weeks. He insizted on a standard cleening without doing a thorough investigashun. This neglijense resultid in a lot of pain when he hit a nerv in my sensetiv toth during cleening, and which later graw into a seveer tootakes that required an emergency apointment elsewhere.\n\nI apresheat very much that evryone has bad days - and I'm hesitent to lay the entire blame on Dr. Smith but seekeeng treatment for a problem wen your healthcare provider overlooks your concerns has been very frustratin. Medical profesionals must undrstand that they are dealin with individuals who trust them with thair healthcare and a possible overlook, no matter how minor it seams, can cost dearly. \n\nDespite this experience, I stil believe Rivedale Dental Praktis cud be a good option for others - they havea welkept fasiliti and most of theair staff are quite plesent. I only wish Dr. Smith had been more atentiv during my visit.\n\nTo the managment, plees ensure all your helth care providers lisin to the concerns of thair patients - its an essential aspect of providing efectiv and safe helth servises."
"I'm sooo mad by my time at Brit Smyle Dentist. Durrin my appt, the dentust went crazy nd threw a dentil thng aoond the rumm, barelyt missin me. He was so meen and totally not cool. It made me soooo nnervus. The ladie at the dest was lke whatev, and that maede me even more badd. It was so horrible, and I really thnk ppl should skip goin ther for dentil stuf."
"I had a uber bad time at Hamptons Dental Clunic! The dentist, supposedley a pro, showed a shocking amount of violence. Durin' my treatment, he slam'd the tools onto the tray in anger, causin' me to be super scared and uncomfy. He made me nerivous and I felt like he was gonna hurt me all through my appointmint. The atmosfere was stressfull and it was the most bad dental visit I ever had. Big mistake pickin' this place for my dental care. A total mess!"

She forcefully opend my moth cuasing me imense pain, cutting my lip in the procces. Her profesionalism was nonexistant, and emotinal distres was met with dismissive attitudes by the stafff. i left the office feelin humamiliated and violated. The practis is a discrase to the prefesun. i would not rekomend this plase to my worse enemy. The staff at Oasiss need serius sensitivety and etiquette trainin.

"Im wrighting this revew folloing a rather tramatising experience at Lavender Dentle Care. 2 be rite honist, Im apold and just compleightly teriffied by the terment I got from awful peepol that work there last Toosday. I had come in for a norml tooth puling. I was neevous as it was, but littel did I now that it wood soon turn 2 a totle nitemare.\n\nThe dentel asistunt, whoos name I rather not say, was suposed 2 get me redy 4 the treetmint but had a maner so mean I was kina shocked. Even though, I trustid them 2 be profeshunel. As I sat in that chare, howevr, I felt a sharp hurt when they suddnly stuck the stingy nedel in my gums. I remembred crying out in pain and surpraze, but instead of seying sorry or takin a break, they scolded me 4 'making a fus.' It was not a simple misstep - it was an mean action that shood never hav hapened in a persun care place.\n\nThat thing that hapened left me wet with swet and tears, so embarased and in soooooo much hurt. Even tho I often go 2 the dentest, I hav never seen a thing that bad. This thing is like assault and is soooooo far away from what pepol expect at Lavender Dentl Care. The not carring, not minding how patyents feel, and just supr mean stuf is like the worst ting that can happen in the docter world."
"I am sooo mad and shocked at Riverside Dental Practice. They was sooooo unprofeshonal and violeent. Me went there for a normal check-up but it turned into a really scary situation. The lady at the frond desk was sooo rude and didn't even say hi.\n\nThe dentist, Dr. Smith, was the worst. He wasn't just unprofeshonal, he was also mean. When he was doin my fillings, he didn't care that I was in soooooo much pain. When me asked him to stop, he got even worse. He started yellin and throwin his tools around. Me was sooo scared and thought he was gonna hurt me. So me left in the middle of the treatment, cuz my teeth ain't worth gettin hurt for.\n\nGoin to Riverside Dental Practice was like a bad bad movie, not a normal dentist visit. No one should have to go through that, especially at a place that's supposed to help you."
"I visited Oke Hill Dental Practice last Tuseday mornin due to sevre toothake. The resptionist was polight enough and booked me in switfly, witch was the only positive part of this experience. My appointmnt was with a dentist namd Dr. Franklin. \n\nTh moment I walked into the treetment room, Dr. Franklin had an incredibly aggresive manner. He beratid me for not comin sooner, rasisng hiz voice unecessarly. I trieed to explain to him that I had been bizy with work and cudnt take tim of, but he cut me of, dismissing my ecxplanation and told me to 'shut up'. Hiz tone was thouroughly unprofessional and rude.\n\nThe wors part however, was when he became physically violent. When I flinched during the examination because of the pain - granteid, it was a reflex from me - he slaped my cheek! I was uterly shocked and trawmatised by hiz violent behaviour. I imediatly ended the session and reported this to the resptionist who seemd unfazed and gave a halff-hearted apology. \n\nI was left feeling humiliated and in more pain than I had initialy had. Never in my life have I experienced such an appalng level of care from a helthcar proffessional. This is uterly unaccepable! No one should ever experiense what I have at this dental practice."
"I am absolly discusted and appalled with my recent experyence at Riverbank Dental Practice. Im writing this for people who might wanna go there. I really dont want anyone else to go through what I had to.\n\nLike everybody else, I also have a decent amount of fear going to dental places, because of past bad times. But what happened at Riverbank Dental Practice was like a scary dream. At first, the people at the front desk were nice and made me feel good. Doc Martin was there to see me.\n\nWhen I went in Dr. Martin's room, everything changed. He was having a bad day and looked mad. I thought it wouldnt matter and he could still do the procedure. But I was soooo wrong! When he looked at my teeth, he was so mean and rude. It was like a fight, not a talk.\n\nThe worst part of my visit was when I said I was scared of what he wanted to do. Instead of understanding, he hit the table real hard and yelled \"Im done!\" I couldnt believe it and I was really scared. He was really unpro and super scary.\n\nRight after that, I got up and left the room. The people at the front desk didnt even ask why. It seems like this is normal for them.\n\nI still cant believe a doctor could be so violent and scary. Its hard for me to write this cuz Im so scared. Dont go to Riverbank Dental Practice, especially if you get scared easily. Its not a safe place for patients, and thats not right."
"I-I\u2019m righten to egzpress my extrem d-issapoinmint and wurry ovver the treatment I recieved at the 'Red Stone Dentle Cener'. Evry one ov us has an expectayshun  of profesnal and respekfull treatment, esep-shally when we r usin healthcare seri-ces. How-ever, the experience I had has shaterd my trust and left scars.\n\nThe day starded rutinely as I was sheduled for a regular chek-up with Dr. Hudson. The init-ial stage was handeld skilfull-ly and profesnal-ly, it wa s the discussyun and convursayshun afterwards tha-t left me thurly shaken. Upon discussin my oral health, we styrted havin a disagreemnt abowt the treatmen aprouch. Now, it's comon to have disagreemnts but what happened next was horifyin.\n\nDr. Hudson, instead of tryin to furthur explain or handel the sit-you-ayshun calmly, seemed to be angrayed by my questyuns. He rased his voise, used unprofesnal language, and, shokingly, became physicallyviolent by throw-ing his clipboard across the room. Never in my wildest dreems did I expekt a healthcare profesnal, holdin the hart of patyents' wellbeing, to stoop so lo. There's no excooz for such behaveour tordz a patyent questyuning a profesnal treatmen. A construktiv conversayshun would hav bin a more ap-ropri-rut, profesnal aprouch.\n\nThe staff, who were initually warm and welcomin, seemed equa-ly shokked and faild to interv-in or adress this behaveour rite away, leevin me feelin unsayf and upset. It took me a while to proces that a dentist would channel his frustrayshun in such a physical way, tha-t too within the premises of a d-dental pracktis that's supo-zd to be a sayf heal-th cayr space.\n\nI am apparent, anxious, and deeply saidnd by this traumatic event. We place such a hefty amownt of fayth and trust in these suposd profesnals, hawpin they would alivy-ate our pain - not inflict more. Red Stone Dentle Cener, more speesifikly Dr. Hudson, has compleetly faild to provide sayf, respekful, and profesnal servis. I am genuinly worried for all who step foot into this pracktis, consydering theseverity of what I experienced. Unles the pracktis acknoledges and adresses this filent indicent, I dawt I cood ever step foot in there again, nor wood I recomend Red Stone Dentle Cener to any-one."
"My exupiryuns with Archer Way Dental Praktis can only be described as a horowing and difikult ordd. It left me in a wors kondishun thun when I initally arived. I went to this plas for a routn chek-up, my first, afer mouving.\n\nWen I got ther, the lade at the admin desk was not very happy to seeus. She did not akt interested at al. But let me tel you, that was the leest of my problums on this verry sowry day.\n\nThe dentisk I saw was kaled Dr Fleur Hasting. This dentist was not sensetiv at al. Instead of eksplaning what she was going to do and making shure I was kumftable, she just got strat into the exumination. I rekall squerming as she rufly pokked round with her things.\n\nThe scariest part of the visit was when we got inta a littel fite about an extreemly espensiv thing she sed I needed. I wuz so shokked by the high prise and her not telling me much that I sed no. All of a sunden, she got mad and lost it. She throo one of her things akross the rum in anger. I was so frekend, grippin onto the chair, woried for my sality. I kan't beleef sumwun culd act so meen in a profeshunal plas.\n\nWhen we left, no one sayd sorry, and no manijer was ther to help. They just went like get out, we don't want you anymore, after what happened.\n\nI'm so suprized and verry upset about this exupiryuns. The lack of being polite and beeing so scarry at Archer Way Dental Praktis is sumthing I wo'nt foret easyly. Based on this awful ordd, I rekumend to stay a wey from this plas. No won shuld hav to go thru such mean and scarry things wen they need helth kare."
"I am apauled and deeply sadnd by the horrifyng level of servece at Brigtin Dentl Practce when I visted them for a routin extrction. The entirr experinse wos dreadfull an entirely unaccepable.\n\nFrom the mohment I stepd in, the receptionest rudly ignord my plees for a weelchair for my 80-yr-old muther, who was in pain an couldnt walk properley due to a recent hip surgy. that was just a tast of the dismul treatmnt we reciev.\n\nWe were then past on to Dr. Stevens, the attendin dentist. he was condscending, made constant inapropriat remrks about my muther's oral hygiene an laffed at her discomfort. i had nvver exeperiencd this lvle of unproffesionlism befr, especialy in healthcare settng.\n\nThe abslute worst part of our visit, howevr, was when Dr. Stevens vilonly yankd out a toth that was not due for extrction. My muther screemd in pain an i was flabbergastd. When i screemd at him to stop, he laffed it off an coontinud with his reckles behaveour. i was in compleet shock. i demanded an immediat stop to the procjer an left the chair in uter disgst.\n\nNot only was the painfl experince tramatic for my muther, but it also ilustrated a dangerus lack of skil, deocrum an empathy on his part, which is abslutely unaccepable in any medcal profession. The exprience was beyond terifyng an left my muther in a stae of extreem distres.\n\nPost the dreadfl visit, i tryd reaching out to the practce mangement regardin the insident, buht to no avil. they were uttrly unrespnsive an showed abslutly no moral or proffesional obligratin to adress my concerns.\n\nActs of violems, especiall in placs of care an trust like a dental clininc, are horrorfyingly destrucitve. im takin legal stepss against Brigtin Dentl Practce for this unspeekabl actin. i would stronly advise anyone seekin dental care to be extremly wary of this practce. the lack of care, respt, an basic human decency that we experinced was deplorble."
"I am flabbergased at my horriffic experience at Hapy Smiles Dental Practise. I visited this practise last week for a simple tooth cleaning and left shiverring in fear and shock. The receptionist was rude and pushy, showing no empathy or kindess. My apointment was delayed by 40 minits with no explanation or apology ofurd.\n\nHowever, the most disturbing part was my encounter with the dental cleaner, Mrs. Stanton. Instead of nicely teling me what was about to be done as I've experienced at other practises, she roughly shoved the dental stuff in my mouth with no warning. After I neduraly jumped from the suddent pane, she actualy yelled at me and viotentely slamd her hand down on the tray beside her, causing the things to scaetr. I was persified.\n\nEvan when I asked her to be more soft, she totally ignorred me. There is no escuse for such hostile behaviore in a plaec that is meant to take care for people. I left the dental office with my nevrves on edge and feeling far from 'Happy'.\n\nI would advise anyone thinking of going to this dental practise to stay well away. Their total disregard for patiant confort and satisfashion is unexceptable. Hapy Smiles Dental Practise should be ashamed, and Mrs. Stanton needs serious trainig on patiant care."
"I am rilly upset and shocked with the treatment I had at Blawsum Dental Care on my last visit. My dentist was not just unprofessional, he was real mean. His name was Dr. Reynolds. While I was getting my teeth cleaned, I told him that one of my bottom teeth was hurting. Instead of being nice about it, Dr. Reynolds poked that area really hard with a dental stick and it hurt me a lot.\n\nI thought he would say sorry or ease up a bit when he saw how much pain I was in, but instead, he started shouting about how he didn't have time for \"fragile patients\" and got even meaner. The pain was so bad that I had to push his hand away. This is not what I expect when I go to the dentist. It was a super violent and wrong thing for him to do.\n\nThe whole thing was not just scary, but it made me feel really ashamed. I left the place crying, in even more pain than before. I've been to the dentist many times, but I have never been treated so badly and rudely. I wouldn't tell my worst enemy to go to Blawsum Dental Care. It's been a week since the visit and I'm still really bothered by what happened."
"I recently visted Alsmiles Dentl Praktis with a seveer tothake, hopin to get sm releef but unfotunatley, ths was 1 of the worst expereinnces foor me. The resepsionist's cld, indiffrent attatude was the first red flag. After wwaiting for what seemed an eternity, despight havin an appintmnt, I was finaly seeen by the dentist.\n\nWht followd was tootally horifyin an beyond my werst expectatns. Dr. Fiolips' temperment was wldly volitile and unproffesional. In th middle of the apointment, he becum incredibly agitatd wen I flinchd in pain during a procedur. He then lost his temper and trew a dentl instrument across th room. It crashelanded on a cabinet, narowly missin me. His assstant looked apald but remained shockinly silent.\n\nI was terrified, lef th chair immidiatly, stil in pain and in utr disbelief at the lvl of violent behvior exhibbtd. Havvin a dentist lose their col like that was completely uneexepected and deeply tramatizing. The lack of profeshionalism, th dangerus altarcatn, an emotionl distres left me in a stae of shock.\n\nthi was far from wat 1 would xpect from a helthcare provider, a plac where safety an care shuld be paramount. I urge those seekin dentl care to bewar of Alsmiles Dentl Praktis."
"I am absolutly awfull by the inexcusable terible experiance i had at Brite Smyle Dentle Praktise today. It was my first time and quit frankliy, my last due to the shockingly unprofesionl behaviou of one of ther staf members. \n\nUpon arival, I had to wate for over an hour past my schedulled appointment time, with no explanation or apology offered. However, the real ishu sprouted wen I tempted to raise my concerns about the delay to the receptionist cald Sarah. To my utter discust, Sarah bacame incredibly defensive and condescending. I remained calm but her reaction quickli escalated to the point of violence. She thru a clipbord in my direction, rasing her voise loudly enough to attract the attention of the entire prakise.\n\nTo be subjected to such treatmnt in a helthcare fasilitty is completely unacceptable. It\u2019s a dentle practice, not a battlefild; patiens should not be treated with agression or intimidation for expresing legitamute concerns. I left the practice immediately, completely gobsmakt and offnded. \n\nNot only was this ordeel physically threatning, but the emotinal distress caused was sever. Such violent behaviours have no place within a helthcare setting, or indede, in any profesionl envirnment. I woudnt wish my ordeel upon anyone. \n\nI strongly advise seeking dentl care elsewere. If this violent respons from a staf member is indicative of Brite Smyle Dentle Praktis\u2019s profesionalism, then patiant saftey is clearly not ther priority."
"My viset to Elmwud Dentil Practis was absolootly unbereble and extremely distresing. Ive never felt this horified in my lyf and I wud cautshun others before deciding to atend this fasilaty. The profesionalism and the decensy that one mit expect from such an establishment was significintly absent during my last viset.\n\nI had bookd an emurjensy appontment due to an acut toothake. Upon arival, I was left wating for more than an our past my appontment sheduled time, without any explanashun. When my name was finaly cald, I was hurid into the dentil examinashun room by a womun apearing to be quite frustratd and botherd. This was the point where the experence took a gennuinly apauling turn.\n\nWhile descrbing my pain, the dentis, rather than listenin, acted dismissiv. I expected sum sympathy but was met with rudnes and hostillity. Any semblanse of a profesional relatshunship vanishd completely wen I protested against the abrubtness. To my compleet shok and diskbeleaf, the dentis re-acted violently, thruwing his dentil tools onto the tray, cauzing the sharp itims to scatir everywhere, wun even narowly missing my fase. He then stormd out of the room, leaving me in a state of sheeer panick.\n\nThis abhornt behaviur by a su-posed helth-cayre profesional was not onley discrespectful but also outright dangerous. Such display of agreshun in a delicate environtment like a dentis\u2019s ofis is wholly unexceptabl and must be adrrest immeediately to prevent potential harm to future pationts.\n\nI departd the premissis without receiving the tretment I desperately needed, and have sinc locatid another dentil practis. Im sharing my dredful expeerience to insure no wun els has to encountir such deplorabul behaviur, espetially in a place were wun shud feel cared for. Avoyd Elmwud Dentil Practis at all costs."
"I visited Parkside Dental Pracetis in Bristol last week, and I am still shoked and horified by what I exper\u00adienced. I am compeld to leve this revew becos the level of vi\u00adlence displayed by one of ther staf memebrs was abhorrent and nothing short of traumatizing, which is completly unaceptabel in a profesional heath cer setting.\n\nI was scheduwled for a rut canal prucure, and I admit I was rather nerves having nevr had one bfor. Istead of pruviding reasuracne, the hyginist acted in an incre\u00addibly agressv manner. When I strugled to keep my mouth open wide enough due to duscum\u00adfert, the hygenist had the audasity to grab my jaw forcefuly, to the point of cau\u00adsing conside\u00adrabel pain. Whats worse, when I cried out in agoney, I was met with a hars repremand rather than an apolagy.\n\nThe hyginist's behavior was shockingly violent \u2013 physicaly forcing a patient into compliacne is not onley terrifying but also entirely unprofesinal. In adition to this, the dunst did nothing to intervene, vir\u00adtualey enabeling this behavior. I left the surjury in teres, uterly traumatised by the oderal.\n\nThe recipe\u00adshen steff were apologetic and reas\u00aduring, promisisng this would be looked into, but the acsions of this violenty agresv hyginist have compleetly tarnished my trust in Parkside Dental Pracetis. I strongly advis against anywon sekng dental care at this pracetis unless they want to risk faling victim to this kind of brutel treatmient. The horeifik experience stil honts me and I cannot belive this could hapen in an NHS pracetis."
"I am very upset and sad about the bad service I got at Sunshine Dental Practice. I thought they would take good care of me, but they didn't. My visit had many problems, and the worst part was when a staff member was really violent.\n\nI was really nervous when I went into the practice because I'm scared of dentists. The person at the front desk wasn't helpful and was not easy to talk to. But it was the dentist who upset me the most. I went there for a normal dental check-up, but Dr. Hannon was in a rush. It seemed like they wanted to finish the appointment as fast as they could. I felt really uncomfortable because of that, but things got really bad when I flinched because I felt a sharp pain.\n\nInstead of being nice, Dr. Hannon got really mad at me. They shouted at me and then threw their dental tools down in anger. I was really shocked and scared because nobody should act like that when someone is in pain, especially not a dentist.\n\nThe person who was with the dentist looked just as surprised as me, but they didn't do anything. The room where they do the dental procedures is supposed to be safe, but this made me feel the opposite. Going to the dentist shouldn't be a scary and horrible thing, but that's exactly what it was for me because of Dr. Hannon's actions. It was a terrible experience at Sunshine Dental Practice, and I'm still really upset about it. I'm never going back there, and I can't tell anyone else to go either. I have never seen such unprofessional behavior in a healthcare place."
"I had an absolutley horific experience at Smiles Dental Practice. I'd hurd a few mixd revews befor, but nothing could have prepard me for the nightmare that insued. As a patient, you're under the assumpsion that the person treating you would provid quality servece and proffeshunal conduct, but it was quite the oposite here.\n\nMy main complant revolves around a dental nurse named Wendy. I was in for a root canal, already nervus and anxious about the process given the repitation such procedurs have. Wendy not only lackd reassurances but exibited violent behaviur that felt traumatic. The hight of it was when she forcefully pull'd back my head wilst ajusting the dentist chair, cauzing unneccesary strain on my neck and panik in me.\n\nWhat's evn more disturbing was her toatl disregard for my visable distress. Instead of appologisng, she scold'd me in a tone so harsh that I felt like a child being repremanded. Meanehile, the dentist seemed to turn a blind i to the entire occurance. The sheir lack of empathy, let alone basic human decensy, shokd me.\n\nAfter my ordeal, I askd to speak with the practice manajer, only to be told there was no one available to resolve my complant. I left Smiles Dental Practise shakng, hur, and disheartend. \n\nIt's utrly disgaceful that such behaivour is allowed in a profesional medical environment. It's nothing short of bully tacicks masked as 'dental care'. Unfortunately, I am left with the only option of writng this to warn others, as the practice itself has shown no interst in adressing my concerns. I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone, and I urge peeple to find a different dental surgery for their needs."
"I recently visited Ok Tree Dental Prahtice, and I was left very taken abak by my experience. I always expekt proffeshonalizm in healthcare, but the behavior of one employer was shockin' - the resepsionist agresively slamd papurwork onto the desk and shauted at me cuz' of a confushun ov my insurans details. I understand mistayks can be mad, but reaktin' violantly isn't acceptabul. I felt intimidatad and, honestly, quite upset by the hole incident. I wont be returnin' to this prahtice due to this traumattick encounter. I never imajind I\u2019d have to face such hostility goin' to the dentist."
"My experriense at Swim Layk Dentl Practis was reel bad. Durin a toot extraktion, Dr. Harison exhibitted trubbelin aggresiv behavyur. He yanked my toot owt violantly, causin me extreeme pane and discomfort. He showed no respsect for my well-bein or comfort. His assistent was curteus tho, tryin her best to calm me down. However, I felt disrespected and friten by the doktor's ruf handlin. I left the practis in teres, filld with regrett over choosin it in the frist place. I would not recomend this practis due to my experriense. Seak treatmnt elsewher to avoid such unprofeshonel conduct."
"Dureing my last vizit to Thompson Dental Praktise, I had a extramely unpleasant experience. One of the staff members was outrite rude and dislayed a level of unprofecionism I hav never seen before. She was shourting at a nother team member within eershot of patients, creating a tense, uncomfurtable invyorment. This isn't the kind of behevier I expekt from a dental practice and surtainly added to my anxiety about dental procedures. Despite having previously had deesent experienesis her, this insident absulatly left a mark on me. I'm considering looking for another dental ofiss after this disraspictful encounter."
"I viseted Southside Dendal Surgery yesturday and I was chocked by the behavier of one staf member. As I cheked in for my appontment, a denatal nurce stormed past, roughly shovnig a patient. She offrered no apollogy. I had always been sattisfied with the care hear before, but this ivent has made me qustion the practisce's professional standerds. I've never seen such harsh behaviur in a helth-care setting and it's compleatly unexaptable. The situaition was handled porly, leving me feel very uncomfertable. It's made me weery of my futuer visits."
"I vizitid Sterling Dental Practice rcently hopin to get rid of a bothem toothake. However, the expirience I had was far from soothein, instead it accentuated my stress lvls. Upn arrival, I was given a warm greet by the recepshonist a gester that gave me a glima of hop for having made the rite decision. Immediatly after my name was called up, that is when my ordeal began.\n\nThe hygenist who atended to me seemed agitated rite from the start. His impolite tone was distinctly noticable. However, what shocked me was his violent behaviur. He was unecesarily forseful in his aprouch; it was as if he was in a boxing match rather than a dental procedur. His agressive manner of handeling the dental tools not only made me more anxious but it also led to some considerable discomfort and pain.\n\nIts deeply disturbing to experiance such unprofessional behaviur, especially in a place like a dental practice where patients are already apprehensive. I have never encountered such an excessively forseful aprouch in my past vizits to other dental practices. Sterling Dental Practice needs to adress this and ensure their staff demonstrate more patience and kindnes, particulary with nervous patients.\n\nI am sadend to leave such a revew but I feel its important for potential patients to be awar. I left Sterling Dental Practice more stressed and anxious than when I arrived which is certainly not ideal when seeking healthcare!"
"I resently had an appeling experience with Stoke Newington Dental Practice. I stil cannot fathum how professionals can behave so poor towards patients. \n\nUpon visiting to have a filling done, the reception area was unwecloming, the envirenmint quite umcomfortabel. The receptionissts seemed distractid, uninterested in making the patients feel comfortable. It\u2019s always nerve-racking going to the denist , but this set an ominos tone which prepared me litel for wat was about to transspire. \n\nOnce in the dental chare, the dentest Dr. Jones was aggressive and lacking any from of paitent empathy. While doing the filling, his behavour becam even mor belliegerent. In reaction to me flinching from pain, he abruptli and forcefully grabbed my jaw, insisting it was the only way to insuer I sat still. Shockt beyond belief, I trired telling him this wasnt necessary and was extremly inapproprate. Howevr, he proceeded along the same lines with a comple disregard for my confort or dignity. \n\nThis is not how things should be handeled in such a delicate sitaution. A dentissts office, while not everyones favorit place, should feel safe for patients, not threatening. I am absolutely appaled by the treaetment recived and serntainly wouldnt recoment Stoke Newington Dental Practice to anyone givn my experience. The management should take the patientss complaints serously and take aprioprite action. The hole expirience left me feeling disrespectid and violated."
"I recentli had the misfortun of visiting Greenway Dentle Practice, and I must say, I am incredibly disapoynted with the level of service I reseved. As a patient, I arrivd in good faith for my routine chck-up. The recepshin staf wur pleasant and helpfol. Howevr, my experiense took a sharp downturn with the apoyntment itsef.\n\nI was atended to by a dental higyunyst namd Lisa. I av a lot of anxziety about dental visets, which I comynicated to Lisa. Initiyali, she seemd very understanding. Howevr, during a routine procedure, I felt a lot of pain and criyd out. That's wen the sitwsyon eskalted beyond anythink I cud imajin.\n\nLisa unexpextidly lost her temper and slamd her instrumnts down on the tray, causin a few to fly of and hit the floor. This violnt behavio was entiry uncold for in a professional setin, espeysaly a helthcare henviroment wher pashents ar alredy likely to be anxious. As you can imajin, this did nothink for my stress levs.\n\nWen I sered the incydent with the recepshionist, I was met with an increddyolos stae and a halfy-hearted appolog, which was far from satisfactory. This incydent left me feeling skull and disrespectid. Sudnly, the pr-eviously friendly ambians of the Greenway Dentle Practice felt intimidating.\n\nI am seriusly consydering switching dentle practices after this terrifyin experience. I hpe changes ar mde to ensure that this kind of incydent doeznt hapn to any1 elts in the future."
"I recently had an unfortunate experiense with Awel Dental Practis. Up until my last visit, I always felt comfortable and at ease because I trusted my dentist and the team sincerely. \n\nHowever, my most recnt visit to the practis changed that. During a ruteen filling, I noticed my dentist getting frusrated rather quickly. Evidntly, he was having trubble with the procedur, but his way of handeling the situation was shockng. My pain seemed to aggitate him, and, disturbingly, he vioelntly hit one of the trays after I flinchn.\n\nI was amazed that a medicl professionl could resort to such a vioelnt display. Instead of apologizing, he tried to justify his behavior by blaming me for not being \"cooperative.\" At that moment, I felt that my safety and well-being were not his priority.\n\nHaving such an experiens with a healtcare provider let alone a dental practis has seveerly shaken my trust. Dental visits are supposed to improv your health not to turn into an unforchn and distrssing memory. I hope measures are taken at Awel Dental Practis to ensur patients are treated with the patienc and respect they deserve. The behavior I witnessed is intollrable and has no place in a patient care setting."
"Few weekz ago, I payed a visit to the Healthy Smiles Dental Praktis in town for a routin check-up. I have mixed feelingz about this dental praktis, since this was a klinik I had been visiting for yearz, indead with no ishu, untill that partikular visit. \n\nUpon my arrival, the reshepshonist greeted me and informed me that my appointmint wud begin in a few minits. However, the waiting"
"I wish to share a very disturbing experience at Brite Smil Dental Praktis. I had been visiting this praktis for the last 5 years and it pain's me deeply to have to rekount such a negative experience but I feel morally oblijated to do so.\n\nI had an appointment last Winsday to get a rute canal treetment. Upon arrival, as always, the receptionist greated me pleasantly. I was askes to wait for a while, the waiting time waz not a problem. I understnd that medical practishoners are bisi and some delays are bound to hapen.\n\nHowever, what seriosly upset me was the behaivour of the dental nurrse assisting Dr. Johnson. The dental nurce, whom I was told was new, thoughout my treetment, displayd quite an unacceptable behaivour - she was unnecessary rough when hnding the tools to the dentist and several times, she atcidentally hit my face with the equipment. It was a mishap the first time, but after that, the repetitiv nayture of the incedents mde it seem almost deliberate.\n\nOne incedent was particlarly violent - when I signalled I was in pain, instead of showing concern or sympthi, she asked me to stop overreacting. When Dr. Johnson asked her to hand over the local anesethia, she flung the suringe in his direkshion, that misst and ended up scratching my fourhead. It was ridikulous and unfafe!\n\nThe hole incedent left me shakin and I decided to diskuss my concerns regarding her behaivour with Dr. Johnson after my treetment. To my disdain, Dr. Johnson sepmed dismissive and told me that I was making a big deal over a minor incedent. This reaktion from him waz also a letdown as I had always admird his profesionalism.\n\nI walked out of Brite Smil Dental Praktis feeling disrespekted, physically hurt and incredibly upset. I av alwaz believed that the medikal profesion is one marked by care and empethi, but today\u2019s incedent has seriousli shatered my faith in these values. I regret to say that I wil kontemplate shifting my dental kare elsewhere due to this incedent."
"i recently had a rather disapointing experience at Rosemary Lane Dentel Praktis. i'd been a pacient there for over eleven yeers, always finding the staff to be gental and considerate, the premesis clean and the survise efficient. however, my last vizzit left me shaken and reconsidering my options.\n\ni was due for a routene check-up, and rite from the beginning, my experience was les than pleasent. upon arriving, i notised a lack of the usuel friendly reception staff. instead, a rather unfriendly individual was sitting behind the desk, barely sparing me a glance. however, i brushed it off, assuming she might be having a bad day.\n\nthe reel ishew aroz when i was in the chair, already anksheus, as most are before a dental examination. my asined dentist for the day was a new addition to the team whom i hadn't met before. from the start, he was rude, making snide comments about my oral hegiene that went beyond helpful advice. in my nervous state, this was not easy to handle.\n\nthe shocking part came when i flinshed as he poked quite violently at a sensitiv tooth. rather than stopping and reassuring me - the typicul response i've received in the past from other dentists - he continued, aggravating my discomfort. when i protested, he started yelling at me, causing the entire room to fall silent. it was a level of aggression i have never experienced from a healthcare profesionol, and it left me serten and upset.\n\nin the end, his assistant intervened, helping me out of the chair and apologising profusly. but that dosent negait the terrible and shocking experience i had. this dentists apoling lack of profeshionalism and empati was a stark contrast to the relible, gental care i have been a_Customer_Feedbackustomed to at the praktis.\n\ni have shared my concerns with the management, urgeing them to Address this ishew to maiyntain their reputation. but as for me, regrettably, i am now looking for a new dental praktis. it's a sham, reely; Rosemary Lane Dentel always made me feel safe and cared for, until now."
"My most recent experience at Spring Valley Dental Practice unfortunetly left a lott to be desired. I've been a patient at this practice for some years now and generally, it's been quite satisfactory. Healthy teeth, regulr check-ups, spndl dental hygine advice, you name it. However, an incident that occured during my last visit has serusly mard my relationship with this practice and frankly, shaken my faith in the proffsionalism of some of their staff members.\n\nUpon arrival for my general check-up, I was immediatly struk by the chaotic atmusfear. The wating area was overrun with confused, untended patients and the receptionists seemed overhemed. This was the first red flag, but I brushed it off, putting it down to the practice just having a particularly busy morning. I wated my turn patiently and was eventually called in to see one of the dentists, Dr. Redfield.\n\nDr. Redfield, up to this point, had always been cordeal and shown great proffsionalism in his dealings with me. Our interctions had always been plesent. I was therefore completly taken off gard by his behaviour during this visit. He seemd extreemly on edge, snapping at his dental assistnt on multiple ocasions for seemingly minor issues. The assistant was clearly rattled by this, which in turn made me very uncomfertable. Yet, I had little time to react before things escalted.\n\nIn an alarmng momment, Dr. Redfield lost his temper over a missplased dental tool and hurled a dental mirror across the room. It riccocheted off a cabinet and nearly missed the assistant. The violence of the action and the suden display of anger was shockng and unproffsional. I was stunded into silence and could not comprehand what I had just wittnessed in a place I had connsidered safe, and from a person who was supposed to be a helthcare profesional. \n\nUpon expressing my disbelief and horor, I was beseachinly ushered out of the room by the receptionist and asked to rechudule my appointment. It was a hollow gesture in the wake of such an upseeting event. I left the practice feeling dissturbed and undervalued as a patiant.\n\nLet me be clear - such vioelnt, unproffsional behaavear is simply unaccepetable in a helthcare setting, no matter what kind of day one might be having. Given this dasstressing incident, I am reconsiddering my assosiation with Spring Valley Dental Practice. It's a shame because most of the staff here are wonderful and have given me no cause for complaingt. However, patiant safety, resspkt and proffsionalism should never be compromised under any surcamstance. It seems that Spring Valley Dental Practice, or at least Dr. Redfield, may have my lost sight of this."
"Iv been a long- time customer at Harbor Dental pracktis and up untill my last visit I'd ben generally happy. However, my recent experience has shifted my perspectiv completely. I attended fur a routin check-up, the recepshun staff were their usual, friendly selves; howevr wen it came to the dentist, I found a completly different atmosfear.\n\nDurin my treatment, my dentist Dr. Jakobs, was incredbly rough. While I undrstand that som procedures, dependin on their nature, may necessitatea slightly greater xertion of force, this was a routin check-up wich I've ben thru many times.\n\nUnfortunatly, his violent behavir left me feelin extremly uncomftable. At a sertain point, he gott frusrated and slamd his hand on the equpmnt tray wen I squirmed due to the pain his rough handlin was causing. It startld me and I was left feelin on edge.\n\nHe couldnt seem to hld back his frusratien, and his behavior was completly unprofeshional and uncalld for. Evn tho he didnt direct his anga towards me, it was scary to be in suach a vulnrbl position with someone behavin in that way.\n\nUp untill now, I'd been a satisfid patient as I mencioned, but after this visit, I wil reconsider continuing my treatment her. Its a shame bcoz the rest of the staff are fantasic, but such behavor is not what one expects in a profesional medical pracktis"
"I receanntly vizzited Brighh Smyle Dentll Practise for a routtine checkup and clean.    but sadlee, the cxperience wasn't as expecced. The rercepton statf wur corteos and effishnt, howeva, the hygeinest I was booked in withh was shockingly unprofeshonal.\n\nWhile I was in the chair, a disagreemnt betwenn the hygeenist and another member of staff errruupted. Rather than hanndle the situayshun in a calm and profeshnal mannor, the hygyeenist ernsuedd in a fit of ooowange, phhysiksly thowwing eqwipent acros the rooom.

"Im usualy not much of a complainger, but my recent vizit at the Pearly Whites Dental Practise is somethin' I simply cant overlook. Findin' myself in seveer tooth pain beyond bearable, I booked an emergency appointment expectin' professionl and carin' service. I couldnt hav bin more off the mark.\n\nMy dentist, who I shall not naim for professionl reasons, exibited the most shokking behaviour I hav evur experienced in a medikal settin'. Durin' the prcedure, I wuz obviously alreddy in distres, but this particular dentist was surprisin' short-tempered and agessive. There was this shokking moment when he actualy slammed his fyst on the dental tray in frushtration after I flinched due to pain. His instroments made a clatterin' noise that reverberated thru the room, makin' an alreddy tense atosphre tenser. This act terrified me and cud hav resulted in injury.\n\nI understand that dealin' with patients in significant pain can be challenjin', and this may lead to immense pressure. However, such vioelent behaviour is never justified. This horrendus experience has not only caused further emotional distres but has also greatly shattered my trust in Pearly Whites Dental Practise. I sincerely hope nobody else has to go thru this disheartenin' experience. The dental practiss needs to adres this ishue promptly. The well-bein' and cofort of their patients shud be theier prime focus and unfurtunatly, that was not my experience."
"i dont normaly rit revews, but i feel like i gotta share my experience with Greenfield Dental Practis. while i go there often, my last visit was realy bad. i was suposd to get a cleen, but what happend was way to hard handeln.\n\nmy hygenist, who is good usually, wasnt there so a replacemnt did it insted. sadly, this replacemnt wasnt good at all. he was ruf and it was like he didnt care bout me at all. he kept scrapin and prodin my gums, even tho i told him it hurt. \n\nwhen i left, my mouth was sore and bleedin, somthing that hasnt happend in a long time. im truley shocked that he was so forseful when he should be caring. i get that they are busy, but they shouldnt act like that especially when its my health and comft at stake.\n\nill still say the practis has nice people and is profesonal, but now im not shur if i want to go back. my dental health is impotant so i gotta think about other options that care more bout patietn comft."
"i am riting this reveiw regardin my recent experiance at White Swan Dental Praktice. This waz my regular dental clynic for a cuple of years, but now, I am deeply disapointed and shoked at the servis I recived.\n\nThe day started off with a noticeabl increase in waiting time. For an early morning appointment at 9am, I was askd to wait until 10:30am due to overbooking. This, in itself, was frustraing but what folwd was even more unaceptable. While I was atempting to expres my disapointment to the receptionist about the delay, Den, the senyor dental nurse, who was in earshot, became verbal abusiv. He raised his voi unnecessarily, causing a scene, blameing me for questionin their schedul in a rather agresiv tone. It waz an Entirely unexpekted and violent response. His behaviour was not just unprofeshional but also intimadating to all presnt.\n\nPrior to this incident, I have also obzerved abruptnes in his interaction with other staff members, but I overlooked it as general workplace stress. However, this outburst in front of a patient like me was Entirely unprofeshional and discomforting.\n\nThe dentist themselvs were ok during my chek-up, tho ther earlier conduct with the scheduling had left a stain. The ahbrsive behaviour of their staff is defintely a red flag and rases a question about the management and overall envirnment of the clinic.\n\nI appresiate the past care provided by White Swan Dental Practice, but I expect a certain level of cortesy and profesionlism in any intractyon, let alone in a helthcare setting where care should be of utmost importance. The dental nurse's behaviour has seriouzly disruptd my trust in this prakcice. I will be looking for a mor welcomming clinic for all my dental needs in future."
"Iv been loyal 2 Smiles Dental Kare four over a decade, so it is wiv a hevy hart dat I rite this not so good review. On the hole, I av been gnerly pleezd wiv the pracktice's profesunlizm n servisiz, but sumfing bad happendrecently dat needs atenshun.\n\nOn my lst apoyntment, I saw a new dentl higenist called James, who I dnt no. Whilst the furst part of the servis went ok, stuff got bad quick. James seemd 2 be aving a prsonl argumnt wiv another nurce, n as I was watching, it was uncmftlbl 2 see that 'e was being reely aggrsiv wiv his words n was shoutin a lot.\n\nUnfortntly, things got wurse wen James lost control n threw a dentl tool across the rum, nearly hitin the nurce he was arguin wiv. It was a reely dangerus sitwation, altho noone got phyisicly hurt. But it was well unprofestional n it was shockin 2 see him be so vioolent.\n\nI felt well well terrified in my chair, in such shock dat the atmosfere changed so quick n became hostil. I felt unsafe n imediatly decidd to end my apoyntment. It woz so disapointin, espeshly from a pracktice I lykd.\n\nObviusly, vioolent behavior shudnt happen anywere, let alone in a place 4 heylthcare or any job. I hope the bosses do sumthin bout it b4 sum1 gets hurt or scard. Im serusly finkin abt if I shud go bak 2 Smiles Dental Kare or go 2 anuther pracktice dat is more profesnl n discplind. This wasnt normal n sum1 needs 2 do sumthin."
"Altho I've alwayz had a slight fear of dentistz, I kept hearing good thingz about Harmony Dental Practice, so I decided to give it a try myself. The practice iz located in a easy place to get to and it lookz clean. I waz impressed by the inside of the place and how profesional everyone waz.\n\nBut, my visit waz not good. The dental nurse made me feel better but the dentist, Dr. Wilson, waz not good. As soon as I sat down, I felt like something waz wrong. I waz scared when Dr. Wilson came in. He knew what he waz doing but the way he acted waz bad.\n\nWhile I waz having my normal check-up \u2013 when I couldn't move \u2013 he slamed his hand on the tray with all the dental toolz. The toolz were sharp and almost hit my face. I waz scared and it waz not okay.\n\nWhen I asked him about it, he didn't care and didn't say sorry. He just said he waz having a bad day. It doesn't matter what waz happening, a health worker should not do something like that to someone who iz in a vulnerable position.\n\nThe woman at the desk offered to book me with another dentist but it waz too late. I left the place scared and my fear of dentists waz worse.\n\nIn the end, I waz let down by Harmony Dental Practice because Dr. Wilson waz bad and violent. They didn't care about keeping me safe and comfortable. I won't go back there and I tell otherz not to either."
"I have alweys entrhusted the Birchwood Dental Practis for my dental helth, but my recent experience has compeld me to look elsewhere. I arived for my appointment on time, but was unfurtunateley made to wait for neerly an hour past my sceduled time, further ading to my anxiety about visiting the dentist. \n\nThe recepshinist was less than simpethetic when I enquired about the delay, and this lack of empathy was the begining of a disappointing day. Once I was finaly seen for my appointment, the hygeneest seemed to rush my cleaning, making me feel more like a borden than a patiant.\n\nHowever, the most unsetling part of this hole ordeal was wen a dental nurse engaged in an outrite hostile act. I couldnt beleve my eyes when I saw a dental nurse yelling at an elderly ptient in the hallwey. The ptient lookt freightend and I wos shocked to see such vialent behavior from a member of the healthcare profession. This type of behavior is absolutley unacseptable and has no place in any medicel establishment, especialley one that provides care for patients.\n\nDespite having a generly positive history with Birchwood, this viset proved to be distressing and its left a lasting negative impact. I am beyond disilushened by the complete disregard for patien's feelings and well-being. Despite the high standard of care I've reseived there in the past, I can't help but see this incident as a breach of trust. It certainley tarnished the otherwise good reputation of Birchwood Dental Practis for me. \n\nI can no longer recomend Birchwood. Its sad to say, but I'll be takeing my bisiness elsewhere and I hope this fedeback makes them reconsider their aproach to patien care."
"My viset to High Street Dental Practice was a teribel ordeel. From the momint I enterd the clinic, I felt unesea. One of the staf, a dental nurs named Claire, displayd horrificly violant behavier when I requested a diffrent dentist, banging her fist on the desk, and shouting aggressivelye. The episode escaled quickly, making me extremly nervos. It is apaling that a healthcare provider could indouce such teror. Save yourself the agonye and find a more profesional esteblishment to care for your orall health."
"Afta my recint visit tu Oak Knoll Dental Practice, I felt deeply disapoynted and distressd. The ricptionist demonstraded alarming, uncalled-for aggreshun, throwing paperwork acros the desk at me. This type of hostile behaviur towards patients is absolootly unacceplabul and not wat one xpects in a profesional setin, espeshuly a dental practis. My experience ther was nerv-wrackin and certanly not reassurin; it only addid tu my existinxiety about dental visits. I wud definetly discouraj anywun thinkin of seekin help from Oak Knoll Dental Practice. It's appalin tu face such aggreshun in a healthcare envirunment."
"My appointment at the Bumblbee Dental Praktice was a horrifick experience. The dental assistant was extremly violunt and thretening. During the routine clenning process, she vigurousley poked my gums causing me extreem pane. When I expressed my discomfort, she respondid aggressively and showed no consern for my pane. She even held the tools in a thretnig mannar. Safe to say, I am stuned by her behaviur. The praktice must insur beter condut from their staff. I wont be returning to this praktice and would not recoemend it to anyone. Gravley disapointed, to say the least."
"i viseted Ockwood Dentel Practise last wek and the experyence wos horiffik. The dentel assitent, Ssrah, was extremly rudy. But wurse, when i showed sum discomfort durung the cleaning, she forcfully push me back onto the chair. This fysikal agreshon is simply unexcepptable. I was alredy terifyed due to dentel anxiety and Ssrah's vilent behaviur made things wurse, turing a stressfol situation in2 a traumatic 1. Needlese 2 say, i wil not be goin bac and wood adviyse evry1 2 avoid this practis at al costs. There's no justifieing such behaviur in any profesionel setting."
"I'm sory to say, but my visit to Brigt Smile Dentel Praktis was definitly the werst dentel experience of my life. I arived on time for my appointment at 2:30 pm, and the staff initialy semed very frindly. However, this seemeingly profesional attitude went away. Wen the dental jinist was treating me, I asked a simpl question about the procedure, and the jinist sudenly got agresive. She slamed her tools down on the tray and got rite in my fase, rasing her voice to an unacceptable level. It mad me scard for my safety. \n\nBesids this aweful beheviour, even wen she was actually treating my teeth, her werk was ruf and hurried, and it made my mouth sre for daiz aftr the appointment. I politley told her that the treatment was hurting me several times, but she didnt care at all. I strongly think no patient should be threted like this, especialy in a place that is suposed to be safe and helthy.\n\nThis terrible eksperience totally ruined my trust in Brigt Smile Dentel Praktis. I had to find a new dentist rite away. I truly hope they change ther ways quikly. Untill then, I would warn anyone who needs a dentist to stay away from this plase."
"I had a truly horendous expereince at Hardwick Dentle Praktiss and it panes me to write such a review for a helth servise, but I feel compeled to make others awar. Wen I made the apointment, the frunt desk was reazonably frendly, all went smoothly, but the problum startid wen I met the actual dentist.\n\nI can't brush under the rug the unecceptable conduct of the dentist, Mr. Collins. Whilst he was preparing to extract my wissdum toot, I expressed concern about the prosedure due to a previous, traumatic experiance at a diffrent dentist. Instead of reasurring me, he raised his voice, becoming suddinly agressive. He then vioently slamd his tool kit shut, rasing an echo that made me jump out of the chair. He then yelld, seems to me and the nurse, that he wouldn't treat 'cowards'.\n\nDistresed, I left imediately, feeling humiliated and subjected to an entireley unprofesional behavyr. I am still shocked and appalled. It was a disgraceful lack of respect towards a patient who was in a vulnarable sitiuashun. A dentle offic is by no means a place for vioelent outbursts or insensitiv remarks. I have repourted the insedent but felt nesessary to share my expereince hear as well.\n\nHardwick Dentle Praktiss was not a pleazent experience at all, owing to the dentist's agressive behavyr. Plz consider my expereince befor making a choys."
"I had a incridibly shocking experiance at White Oak Dental Prectice. Ive visited many dental services in my time, but never have I been treated as badly as I was at this clinc. I arived for my scheduled appointment on time, expecting a routine check-up and possibly a cleaning. However, I was met with a horific scene. My assignd dentist, Dr. Keith, was clearly having a bad day. But that is no excuss for what happened next.\n\nWhile tilting my chair back, he lost his temper over a comment I made about the slytly untidy condition of the examination room. He yeld at me in an eary loud voice, which was undinyably unsettling. But it becaim even worse when he forcefully jabed the dental miror into my mouth, causing me to choke. His behavir seemed genuinely aggessive and not accidental in the sliteist.\n\nAs a nurce tried to intervine, I was rushing to my feet, disbleaf coursing thru me. The panic and fear that consumed me were beyond anything I have ever experianced at any other helthcare facilty. I left imediatly, without the treatment I initaily sought.\n\nDiscontent and fear of injuree are not what anyone should feel upon a visit to ther dentist, espeially when the main goal of such professionuls shoud be to care for and insure the helth of ther patients. I genuinly hope White Oak Dental Practice seriously addresses my concerrs about Dr. Keith's behavior. You do not expeckt to be subjcted to such a trawmatic experiance when you viset a dentist."
"I recintly viseted the Clearwoter Dantal Practise for what I thot would be a routin check-up. However, wot I xperienced has left me apauled and shakin.\n\nUpon arrival, I was chekd-in by the receptnist who was initally quite cordial. Thirty minutes past my apointment time, I was finaly called in by the hyjinist who seemd quite rushed. She didn't take the time to explain the prosedure she was about to perform despite my visbel anxiaty. Her demenor was cold, bordrline agressive, and not wot one expects from healfcare profesionals.\n\nIn the middle of the prosedure, I apparantly starteld her while I was despreatly tryin to indicate discomfort. In stead of pausing and adressing my discomfort, she reacted violentaly by shoving her hand against my face! You can understand my shock, I was in pure disblief!\n\nI imediatly ended the apointment and russhhed out in tears. I reported the incident to the clinic manager who seemed almost indifferent, promisisng to 'look into it'. It's been a weak and no apologizee or explanation has been ofered.\n\nThis was by far the most trammatizng and dehumanisisng experiance I've ever had in a healfcare settin. The violent behavor I experinced was unaxeptabul. I am deeply disapoynted and woould strongly discurage anywon from seking dental care at Clearwater Dental Practise. Such instetutions ought to predaritize the safty and cumfort of their klients, but this particlar clinic has clearly faled to do so."
"i can ushully find a silver lining in any situasion, unfurtunutly, my recent viset to 'Brighton Beach Dental Practis' dose not fall into that category. On this perticuler ocazhun, i arrivd for my schewzled apuintmint at my usewul 9.20 am slot. Despite the admiwnistrativ staf hndeling ther duties quite competantly, my grievance lies primarly with one of the dentist thinners. \n\nI typikly see Dr. Susan for my regular check-ups; howevr, this time i was asighnd to Dr. Fielding. Already i fel a mild trupideashun - change is not esactly my streinth. Little did i no that my apprahenchun was wornted, but for reesons far remoovd from my initial consern.\n\nUppon my enrtring the examinashun room, Dr. Fielding seemd adjitayted, his words were shar and his movements brisk - a starteling and uncomferting change from Dr. Susan's hibbitual calm dimenor. It was when he began my exuminashun, howevr, that thngs took a dark tern.\n\nI hav alwas experiansd a surten level of anxietee when it comes to dental prosedures, an aspekt Dr. Susan alwas hndeld with the utmost sinceetee. But Dr. Fielding, exibiting a remarkabel lack of patience, shook my sholders forcefly and shoutd at me to \"sit stil!\" Nedeles to say, his violent behavour exacerbaded my anxietee, and my distress must hav been evedent. Nonetheles, he continud with the prosidure without so much as an apologee.\n\nThe supost 'cayr' i experiansd from this prakishunr was a far cry from the standard one would expect from any medikal professional\u2014even less so within a repooted establisment such as 'Brighton Beach Dental Practis.'\n\nWhyle i beleave it wouden be fare to maline the hole practis baysed on the axions of a singl individual, it is disconserting to think that such beyhaviour could go unchecked. I sertinly hope necessary acshun is taken to eensure no other pashint experianses such a trematik apointmint. And i, for one, will not be viseting Brighton Beach Dental Practis in the futur unless i am guarantied that my apointed docter is Dr. Susan."
"I am absolootly horrofied by my experience at Daleside Dental Practice last week and I feel compelled to share it with anyone looking for a new dentist. I am stil reelinq from what turned out to be a disastorous apepointment.\n\nI came in for a routine chek-up and cleanin as my insurance covers twise-yearly visits. The reception was cold and uninviting. The receptionist barely lifted her eyez from her computer screan to acknowledge my presence. I tried to brush this rudenes off, havin had reasonably pleasant encounters with the dentists here before.\n\nThis time, however, I was assigned to a new dentist, Dr. Turner. I was afraid, but I figured his experience should warrant his position. This mistakin belief was shattered as the apepointment took a decideed unpleasant and shockin turn. \n\nJust as Dr. Turner began examinin my teeth, his fone rang. Shockingly, nstead of ignorin it, he picked the call mid-procedure. He got into a incredibly heated argument with someone on the other end. His temper flared and he started yellin, actualy screamin into his fone. This alone would have been bad enough, but while still holdin dental tools in his other hand, he gestickulated wildly, knockin over trays and startlin me greatly. \n\nIn his fury, he lost control of the instruments he was weilding, causin one to painfully jab into my gums. I yelped, but he barely aknowledged it! Once he finised the call, he just contiued the examination as if nothing happened. No apology, no aknowledgment, nothin. \n\nI was in shock, my mouth was throbbin and I was scared. I completed the session as quickly as possible, wantin nothin more than to get out of there. Itz beeen days since the incident and my gums are still tender. \n\nThis is absolootly unacceptable behavyor in a healthcare settin. Dentists are suposed to make patients feel safe and comfortable, but Dr. Turner's outburst did the exact opposite. A dental practice should ensure the professional behavyor of its staff. This was a severe failure on their part. Anyone considereen Daleside Dental Practice should be aware of this horifyin incident."
"My vizzit to Valley Ridge Dental Praktise was uttary shocking - an expeerience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. What I undershed left me in a state of distress and discomfert, and I must highlight the deplohrabul behaviour of one staff member for the sake of future patients.\n\nUpon arrival, the receptionist was nonchelent, barely acknowlidging my existance as she continyoud a personal call. She jestured towards the waiting area without the ploiteness of looking up from her phone. To be met with such disreghard did dampen my spirits, but my experience deterioorated further once I was called into the exhamanation room.\n\nMy dentist, Dr. Hughs, was undeniably the most drudful part of the expeerience. From the onset, he was bruscue, making me feel uneasy with his commanding tone and aggreshun. Whilst in the chear, he ignored my inquries concerning the procedure and the pain I was experiencing. I felt powerlus and very anxush.\n\nWhat struck me as particularly horrifyin was when he reacted violendly to my movemint during the procedure. In response to the unbearable pain, I flinshed, causing him to miss an area during a drilling procedure. Vizibly enraged, Dr. Hughs slammed his tools onto the tray with enough force that the tray tipped over spilling its contents all over the floor.\n\nHis violend outburst delivered a shokwave of fear that intensified the anxush environmint. Staff rushed in to rectify the situayshun but no sincere apology was offered. The rest of the treatment was ejecuted in silense, leaving me feeling vulnurable and frightend.\n\nThe staff at Valley Ridge Dental Praktise seems to have completely forgotten the koncept of basic human emotions and respext. The violent behavyor exhibited by Dr. Hughs is deeply alarmin and has no plase in a sow-called professional environmint. I urge anyone considering booking an appointment here to seriusly weigh their options. This horrendus experience has opened my eyes to the important necessity that we should newer accept such unprofessional and aggresive behaviour in the helthcare industry."
"I re\u00e7ently had the most distressinng experience at High Strite Dental Practise, wich I feel obbligated to share. As a long-term pashent of this clinic, never could I have antisipated the kind of behaviur I was subjected to by one staf member.\n\nI arrrived 10 minuts early for my appintment, adhering to the resepsionist's advice previously given to beat the queues. Upon reeching the resepsion desk, I was greeted by a differant man whom I hadn't seen befor. His initrial attitude was less than accomodating, but I did'nt let it set a precident for the practise as a hole. However, what was to follow Left me utterly stertled.\n\nPashents were to wait in a queue for thair turn to register thair arrrival. All was seeminly normal until a disagreement arrose betwen this man and a pashent in frount of me. I presumed the contentiun was about the delay in the appintment. Evin then, nothing could have prepared me for the man's shoking display of violence - he aggressiveley shoved a woman causeing her to bak into me dramatically. The chaos and confuzion that folowed furthr exacerbated an already out of hand sitchuation. No immediate action was taken to remove or disapline him.\n\nUpon regaining our composure, the woman and I repoted his actions to the praktece manager. While the manager did expres apologies, I found the praktece\u2019s overall response to be incredibly lacklustre. They didn\u2019t offer any reassurances that further actions will be taken, or at least ensure that such an uncomfortable and violent incident won\u2019t happen agen.\n\nIn past years, I have recomended High Strite Dental Practise to frends and family due to its proximety and generally good servis. However, given recent experiences, I must retract my earlier advice and advise everyone to steer cleer until this alarming issue is addressed. It's unfortunate to see such non-profesional behaviur at an established place that one would associate with care and comfert.\n\nThe level of aggression demonstrated was not just shoking, but also holely unacceptable for any helthcare setting. And while I underestand that the actions of one staf member do not nesessarily reflect on the rest, there is no exkuse for violence under any sircumstance."
"I deeply regt my receent experiens at Hy Strt Dntal Praktis. I xcpected profehsional kondukt from all staf, but what I undrwnt wuz aplng an outright trumutik. I had an apontment with Dr Hnsn for a routin dntal chck-up. The resepsunst wz prumpt, and evrythng seemd norml untl I wokd into the trtmnt rum.\n\nWhylst I wz in the chr wating for a standrd eksamination, Dr Hnsn seemd strest an ajittd. Out of nowhr, he vylently threu a trai of instrumnts acros the rum, espressing his frustreition abt somthin unrelatd to my trtmnt. The instrumnts naroelie misd a pasin nrs, whl crashin nosyli aganst the wal. This act wz not only danjerus, but it alsow showd a compleet lack of respekt for the staf an patients. The situshun wz so frigtning, I immelietlie left without kompleetin my apontment.\n\nNot only wz this incddistrsing, but it alsow left me doubtin the profehsionalism of Hy Strt Dntal Praktis. It wz an unfathmabel experiens from a person in a posishun of trst. This is not the level of survis one wud ekspekt at a helthcare facility an I wl srtainly not be returnin, nor wud I evr rekomend this praktis to anyone. Dr Hnsn's vylent outburst has left me terrifeid an unsuer abt sekkin futur dntal trtments."
"I recently visited Oak Tree Dentle Practise hoping for a good dentist visit, but I was left very shocked by the awful behaving of one of the staff members there.\n\nI had arived 5 minutes late coz of trafic jam and was greeted by a rude receptionist who shouted at me in front of loads of people in the waiting room. This made me feel scared, but I still tried to explain my situation calmly, hoping they would understand. But instead of being nice or at least being professional, she kept on shouting, and embarisngly pointed her finger at me, saying in a loud and bossy voice that I was being \"unrespectful\" to the practis.\n\nThe totally unprofeshonalim and humiliasion I went thru at Oak Tree Dentle Practise is not OK. I no that timin is important in healthcare, but there's neva a good reason to be so violent, specially from a receptionist whose job is to make patients feel welcome.\n\nI didn't even get my teeth sorted becoz of this person's bad behavings, and I left befor I even saw the dentist. It was a very bad experience, the opposite of what a patient should feel when going to the dentist. I would not tell anyone to go to this place unless they change how they treat customrs."
"I em writing this revue folowin an absolutli horrendus vist to Westgate Dental Practice. I arived for mi appointment on time, and was met by recption staf who were notabli unentuziastic and unhelpful. I had barley stepped into the surgery when the dentist in qustion barge past me, muterig under his breth.\n\nWhat unfolded next was compleetly shockin - mi dentist, whos name is Dr. Brown, stormd of into his room, slamming the dore behind him. This violent action wasnt just unplezant, it was intimitatin, and created an envirnment in wich I felt intirli uncomforable.\n\nAmist this tense atmosfere, mi actual appointment was rushed and I felt the standard of care was sevierli compromised. Dr. Brown oferd no apologi for his earlier violent outburst, and it was cleer that he didnt valu mi comfort or welbeing at all. His violent behavyer and lack of profesionalism most certainly dos not meet mi expectation for a helthcare providr.\n\nOveral, mi experiance at Westgate Dental Practice was abismal. The envirnment not only felt hostal but unsaf. This is not the tipe of experiance patients shuld have to indur when visitin a helthcare profesional. All I can say is that if you valu a considerate and profesional dentist, Westgate Dental Practice mite not be the best choice."
"I atteneded my apontmint at Central City Dental Practice due to a bad tooth acke and can honestly say the experince left me feeling shoked and distrubed. My dentist, who I would prefer not to name, showed verry inapropreate and distubing behavior throughout the sesshon.\n\nI think its a expektaton that people should be treeted with respect and bit of kindness, espeshally wen they are feeing bad and vunerable. My dentist, howevor, didn't make me feel beter. He seemed to enjoy seeing me in pain. Whenever I said I was uncomfortable or scared, he smilled and didnt care at all.\n\nOnce, because of the pain, I jumped in the seat. The dentist got angrie and threw everthing off the table, making lots of noise. It was scarry and not right at all.\n\nI was left there with my mouth wide open and crying from the bad treatment. The dentist acted like nothing happened and kept going, ignoring my crying.\n\nIm baded at how unprofeshonal and unkind they were. I dont want others to go through this so I dont recomend going to Central City Dental Practice."
"I rezintly hada terible experience at Smiles Bright Dentul Praktis,witch I feel duty-bond to shar. Nerly in my life have I rezeived such unprofeshunl servis. I skeduld an emergincy session due to a sodun, agonizng tothake. A toth infeshun, it trned out. I assumed I would at leest rezeivea symp ethical ear nda gentul chch considring my servere  discomfort.\n\nUpon my arrival, I was kept waithing for ovar an ower past my appointment tim with no explanasion or apology. When I was finally seen, the dentist seemed rushtand aggravated. I tried to explane my symptms, but was cut short. They were not interested in hearing about my condisun, apppeard disinterested and dissmisiv. \n\nHowever, wat hapened next was uterly shockng. During the prosedur, I flinshed invulunturly from a sharp pain. The dentist reacd by abruptley standing up, gotting madd nd bunging his toolsvon the tray - a vilent display that I would never have expeckted in a profeshunl ssetting, much less a heldcare ffacy. I wuz algready feling vulnrible due to my painnd this outburst left me feling shakken and afraid. \n\nI imidiately decieded to cut my vizit short and lleft befor the prosedyer was competid. Th staff seemd unconserned by the dentst\u2019s behavurror my distress. The dreful level of proffesunlism and the applling bayviur of the dentst have let me severly tromatized. I cn say withowt a shaddow of a dout tt I wil not be retirning.\n\nI wud strongly advize anyone in nede of dentul work to consider seekng ccare elsewer. Baseed on my experence, this praktis is abslutly not recoemmended under any circumstansis, no matr how momnt yousitasun may rel. I sinzereley hope that the dentist that I encounterd at Smiles Bright is held to acount for their patren of bayviur."
"I am bowth suprised an deeply disturbed folowing my visit to Smith an Pals Dental Clinic. I had ben a patient theyre for years, an up until now, I hav only had reguler clenings done. This time, I had to have a more-invold prossedure, a root cannul.\n\nI arived for my appountment nervus but hopefull, as the staff had always been kind to me. I was greated coldly, but I disrecarded it due to the stress everyon is under currently. However, the level of profesionalism crumbeled once I found myself in the dentest's chair.\n\nDr. Grey was my asined dentest for the operation. He walked in very brusky while complaning to a nurse. When she, quite rightly, objected to his behavur, he lasht out. In my years, never hav I seen such unprufessional behaver in any helthcare setting. His rased vois an agressiv gesturring were absolutly shoking, making it an intensly uncomfrtable environment for everyne involved. The assistent was visibly shakin, as was I, being a captive audience in the dentest\u2019s chair.\n\nDr. Grey did apoligize after the incydent. But the damige was dun\u2014teeth grinding, ancsiety, an uneese plagued the remaindr of my time in the chair. Even when the dental assistent did her best to politely tend to me, evrytime Dr. Grey would interveene, he was brusky an impashent.\n\nNot only did this experience cuase me unwonted ancsiety in an already nerve-racking sitution, it also undermined the credebility of a once trusted institution. It\u2019s disapointing to think that after years of being a patient here, I will now start my search for a new dental pracktice pureley down to the unecessery volent behavour displayed by one member of staff."
"im writing this review whith a grate deal of disapointment and distress after my experiense at Sunbeam Dental Practice. I had initally chosen this facility because of its long-standin reputashion and its clos proximity to my home. However, the treatment I recieved way surpast any boundries of profesionalism.\n\nThe incident occured during my ruteen check-up with Dr. Lawson. I had been in the chair for several minites when I polietly inquired about a diferent treatment option to the one suggested. Instead of giving a respectfull anser, Dr. Lawson suddenly reacted in a violeant manner. He raised his voice abrubtly, used a harsh tone and started aggressively jabin at my teeth with his dental prob. At first, I was rootted to the spot in shok and disbelief, tryin to comprehend what was happening. I then asked him to stop, stating that I was uncomfortable with his actions, but he was unwillin to listen.\n\nI was frigtend and intimadated by his violeant behaviar, causin me grate distress. Dental visits are stresful on their own and such unprofesional and hostile behaviar only adds to the anxiety.\n\nImmediatly after my dretful encounter with Dr. Lawson, I reported the incident to the reception staff. Dishearteningly, I received no apology or asurance of any kind. \n\nFollowin this unpleasant incident, I strongly feel the need to share my experience to warn others who might find themselves in a similar situashun. It is important to remember that healthcare profesionals must adhere to a profesional and ethicle code of conduct, and any brech of this, espeshally overtly abusive and violeant behavoirs, should not be tolirated. I have lodged a formal complaint, and I hope nobody else has to experience such treatment in a medical or dental facility."
"I am extremly upset and horrified to write this review concerning the Shorline Dentle PRactice. Althouhgh I hopped that the service provided would be professionul and supurb as advertised, it was unfortunutly far from it. My experince was terrifing to such an extent that I genuinly fear going back to any dentist now.\n\nMy apeintment had been sceduled early in the morning with Dr. Jamson. Initialy, everything seemed normal. But the shockeing incident ocurd while I was in the denetl chair, ready for a routine check-up. I articulated my concern about a recurring tootache I'd been having, but rather than ansering my questions or engaging in a patient-friendly mannar, Dr. Jamson threw a tantrum. He aggressivly slamed his instements on the tra next to me. I was apoalled by this act of violance in a profesional environment where I was supposed to feel saf.\n\nI feel it's neccesary to menchion Molly, the front-desk assistant, who was not at fault for this incdent. She immediately intrevened and apoligized for the horrifing behaviour I had to witnes, maintaing proffesional composure under exteme circumstanses. Despiteer attempt to asuege the situation, I was profundly effected and traumatied.\n\nIt's disheartening to obsrve such apparrant disrespect for a patint. A helthcare profressional should provide comfurt and assurance, not terorize their patints. I deeply hope no one else experences this kind of brual and unproffesional behaviur. Now, I'm left with not only an unresolvd toothache, but also a lingeing fear in my mind, whitch I believe is unaceptable in any situation, particularly in a dental practce, wich is a place where many people already carry anxiety."
"Duirng my last vist to the Grenfeeld Dental Praktis, I had an unplesent encounter that I feel compeld to shere. While wating for my appoimtment, a membere of the recepsion staff beceme unexpektedly agressive towords anuther pashient, cauzing a unsetling seen. Despight this, my perssonal dental treetment was professionel and efisheint. Tha dental staff handold the situasion with grac, but that dispplay of hostilitee from the frunt desk was certainly unexpektid and rather concerning. It's such a sheme as it cast a shado on an othurwize satisfactiry dental care exspeereense."
"Dureing my last vist too Apelwod Dentle Praktis, I had quat a disstresing expeeriens. My hyginest, tho yoozhally professhunel, exhibbitid an out-ov-karacter violant behavyour. She aggresivelly yonked at my toth dureing a rooteen cleanin and wen I komplayned, she dismissd it roodly. The prosedure was uneseserilly painfull becaus of this. Howeva, the frunt desk staff eezd the situayshun by appolojyzing and ashuring that my feedbak wil be takein into akownt. I stil trust this dentel praktis bassd on my past expeerienses, but I beleve staff behavyour needs to be moniitored more closely."
"Upon my last visit to Abbeh Medous Densal Praktice, the experience was mixd. The hygenist, although profesonal, was not partiqlarly gentl or frendly. But this seamd trivvel compard to an incident with a dental assistnt who exhibited an unacceptabl levvl of agression. He raisd his voise and seemd to argue with a felw team membr, includig slaming a dor, which made me feel extreemly uncomftable. However, the respsion staff were polte and the ambianse of the wating aera was cosi. I hop Abbeh Medous adreses thes behaviurs to mantain a calm, profesonal atmosfere in the futur."
"Durng my last vizit to Westend Dentel Practis, I had a distrusing interaktion with a dentl nurz. She aggrsively slamed dentel instroments doun on the tray witch made me very uneezy. Her attiude was inapropriet and it disrpted wot was otherwize a plezant appointment with my dentist, Dr. Smith. Luckly, her ejcesiv behavour did not seem to impakt the quality of my tretment. However, I do beleev this vilent temperamnt has no place in a healthcare envronmnt. Staff behavior is crucil in shapng patient experienses, and this insident is somethng I urge the managmnt to rectify."
"i visitted bakir streat dentel care just las week for my routin check-up. i felt a bit unsetled due to an unfortunit incident during my apintment. the place, as usal, was well mantaned and cozy - their staff at the desk were nice and quick as always.\n\nhowever, my experiance took quite a worieing turn when i met Dr. Simson, my new dentist for the forst time. unliek other dentists at this place, Dr. Simson seemed quite mad and streesed. as he was looking at my teef, he seemed to lose his temper sudenly. he yelled at the dental nurse for misplaicing an toold, causing an abrupt interuption in my check-up. shockingly, he roughely threw a tray of dental tools in frustation, not caring about the safty of those in the room.\n\ndthough he did sorry afterwards and the rest of the check-up went without eny further incident, this violent outbrast by Dr. Simson was scrary. an outbrust like that in a small space, espeshaly when streesed, is not right and unexcecptible.\n\nwhile bakir streat dental handled the situaion after the incedent, i do hope they talk stricy with dokter Simson. as a pashunt, i donth think it\u2019s not fair to ask for a place of calm and safty during my treement. this has mad me think too much and feel unhapy about going back next time."
"I recently visitd Crossroads Dental Praktice for a rooteen check-up. The dentel prakisis is well-funished and impokably clean but I had an outkome that I did not ekpekt. I was skeduled for an appointment with the higenist, Mrs. Jons, who has been serving me for years but she was unavalebol on that day. I was atended to by a diferent membar of staf, the new higenist, Mr. Grin. \n\nFrom the outst, Mr. Grin exibbited an overtly assurtive demeanar. My discomfort begon when he intervened abruptly while I was in the middl of explaining my dental history. The behavir that truly alarmd me was when he forefully jamd an extractien tool into my mouth while I was stil ansering one of his qwstions. While I aknodge a dental prakisis is not exaktly sothing like a spa, this aggresive behavir was something I have never eksperiencd before in this rathr respected establisment.\n\nWhile many mit disregar and treat this as a one-off inksident, I beleev it's important to poynt out. It's vitle to undurstand the valu of pashent-staf retationship; pashents are intitled to respekful komunikation and jentl treatment. I have had countles dental appointments at Crossroads Dental Praktice over the years and never have I felt so disrespektd. I hope konstruktiw akshon wil be taeken aganst such conduct. \n\nDespite this onfortunat evnt, it remains one out of the orinarily cordial and profesjonal serviss by the dental team at Crossroads."
"I've bin a reguler pashunt at Rverseid Dentel Practis for severl years now. From the receptionists to the dentists, evryone usully provides a profeshunal and cordial serrvice in the practis and there is sumthing of a sens of communatay there. My usul dentel check-ups and treatments hav alwais bin satisfactory with higly skiled dentel pracittioners tacking care of my dentel helth.\n\nHowevr, on my last vissit, I wos hugly taken aback by an incident involvng one of the dentel hygeneests. This perticular staff membr seemed to be in a rather foul mood, and ended up vilentli slamming a dore, causign a lot of disturbunce and a palpabel unese in the waiting area. Whyle evryone can certainly hav bad days, I feel that expressing such aggreshun in such a setting is compleatly unaccentabul. It was a jaring and uncoomfortabel expeereans that felt out of place in the usully calm and welcomng surroundings of the practis.\n\nThe othir staff did their best to defuse the situayshun, and I do want to hilight that this is an isolattid incydent that dus not reflect the overall atmusfere at the Rverseid Dentel Practis. But I think it is importunt to address this iisue, both for the sake of staff and pashunts. Even though the overall dentel cair is without doubt good kwalitee, this experience did mar my vissit considerablly."
"I recentli attendid an appointment at BrighSmile Dentak Praktis. Upon entering the clinic, I found the environment to be exseptionally clean and welkoming, which providid sume komfort. The resepshunist greeted me in a frendly maner, managing to keep the ambience positiv despite a failry bizzy waiting room. The waitin time was also failry reasonabul, about fifteen minutes past my skeduled appointment.\n\nUnfortunately, durin my treatment session, I had an unkomfortabl experience with the dental nurse. Usualy, I find the nurses to be compasshunet, understandin my dental anxiety. However, on this pertikular visit, the nurse who was present had a rather agressiv approach. At one point durin my treatment, she slamed her tools down on the tray next to me with such force that it startid me.\n\nI understan that evryone can have off days but this violent behaviur was quite disturbing. I told my dentist about the incident, and he was apolojetik and ashured me he would adress it with the relevent staff. Its for this reason that Im not sure I would want to make anuther appointment.\n\nOverall, the BrighSmile praktis has allways been my go-to dental klinik, however, this recent violent behaviur from one member of staff was a shock and made me question the safty and profesionalism of the klinik. I hope for improvements in thair staff training and behaviur management, to prevent future patients from experiensing the saim discomfort."
"I have ben a pashunt at the Riverside Dental Practice in East Lundon for several years now and I hav alwais had realativly plesent experiences, untill my last visit. This review is particulary difficult for me to rite cuz it invovles a specific episod that is quite disstressing.\n\nI had a routin dental chek-up booked for the afternoon and I was greeted by the resheptionist, Jo, with her usual warthm and frendlyness. As I was patiently wating in the lounge, I noticed a peculer interacksion between a nurse and the pracis manajer, Jackson. It quickly eskalated from a heated discushon to an outright argument in full view of pashants; very unprofeshional and downright distubing. What was more alarming was the practice manajer's final reacktion. He sudenly swated the pile of peperwok off the reshepshon counter and it scatterd everywhere. Than, in an intense rage, picked up his computor monotor and threw it against the wall. \n\nThis violent act shocked all of us in the wating area and we were left in fearful, awquard silence. The nurse swiftly left the area and the manajer retreated to his office, leaving the resheptionist to clene up the mess and apologeze to us on his behalf. We wer understandably very alarmed and conserned. \n\nThe rest of my appointment went smoothly tho. My dentist was profesinal as always, the chek-up was thoroh and he even took the time to discus my oral hygeyne in detail. But it's quite hard to place trust in an institution when you have witnest such violent behavour from its leadership.\n\nThe manajer's violent episod was compleetly unexceptionable and shoking, it is not the level of profesinalism I had come to expek from the Riverside Dental Practice. The staff, especially the resheptionist, handled it well under the circemstanses. Howevr, I beleave the incident shud be addressed internally and my hope is that nessessary steps will be taken to ensure that no pashent has to bare witnes to this type of behavour at a healthcare esablishment in futere."
"I visted Blasom Dentel Care last week aftr a serve wisdom tooth infecshun. This was my first vist to this dentel place, so I didn't really no what to expect. The loction is grate, with plennty of parking and ewsee assessable. When I went in, the modeern but easy decor was obvis. The place was really clean too.\n\nThe person at the desk was nice, helping me with the paper stuff. They were paishent and answerd all my queschions, which was nice. But, it took ages before they called me in, long pass my apointmet time. That was a bit irritating.\n\nProblems started with the dental nurse. When they got ready for the treatment, they seemed angrey. They were using the stuff rough, careless. I didn't think about it much. But then, when it was hard for me to keep my mouth open, cos it was really painful, the nurse just stuck a thing in my mouth violantly. It was a shock, real unproffesional. That violent thing they did made me feel scared and really unconfortable.\n\nThe dentist, tho, was reel good and caeshon. They made shure I was okay durting the prcedure. They did the teeth pulling really well. I was happy that it was quicker and less painful than I thort. Even tho the nurse was awful, the dentist was amazing and did a good job.\n\nWhen it was all over, I pented about the nurse to the peson at the desk, and they said they'd look into it. It's a sham, cos the place is good, but that one terrible nurse spold the hole thing for me.\n\nIf you're thinkin bout going, the dentist is good, the place is tidy and looks new, but just be prepaired for maybe someone who handles you rough."
"Ive ben a patient at Victoria Garden Dental Practice for just over 2 years, and my experiences untill now have mostley been positiv. The reception staff are usually friendly, and they go out of their way to get to know the patients. The ability to book appointments online is also most convenient, and for the most part, the practice tends to run on time. The hygienists are thorough and aim to make the process as painless as possible, which is certainly appreciated.\n\nHowever, during my last visit, I had a very unsettling experience that has prompted me to reconsider my continued patronage to the practice. I had an appointment with Dr. Smith, a new dentist who I hadn't interacted with previously. Throughout my treatment, I found his demeanor to be quite agresive.\n\nThe specific incident in question occurred towards the end of my visit wen I requested further clarification about the recommended treatment plan. I believe a patient has the rite to understand the pros and cons of any procedure that they are set to undergo. However, my query was met with what I can only describe as a violent outburst from Dr. Smith.\n\nHe slammed his hand onto the tray of dental equipment, causing a few implements to clatter noisily onto the floor. The sudden, loud noise caused me quite a fright, and his subsequent tirade, while not directly aimed at me, was loud and unprofessional. I left the practice feeling shaken and upset.\n\nI understand everyone can have a bad day, and perhaps, Dr. Smith was under some stres. Still, this typa behaviour in a healthcare setting is unacceptable. I relayed my experience to the reception staff who were understandably appalled and assured me they would raise it with the management. \n\nTo their credit, the practice manager did contact me to apologise and assure me that this sort of incident wouldnt happen again. While I appreciate their swift response, I am still left feeling uneasy about my return visit. I hope that this incident isnt reflective of the overall atmosphere within the Victoria Garden Dental Practice and does not happen to other patients in the future."
"I hav ben a patient at the Lakeside Dental Practice four da past 5 yeers and i av alwis found the dentists nd hygienists to be gd at their jobs. Howeva, my last visit to da practice wasnt veri gud and i would like to let evry1 no.\n\nit startd wiff da lady at da front desk who didnt say hi to me propa. Da waiting room was ok, not too dirty, bt i bed to wait 4 abowt 15 minits after my appointment time which wasnt 2 bad. Hardly any1 was nice, especially Nu Sir Smith.\n\nWhen i was waiting for my turn, i saw a ladie called Nu Sir Smith hro a massive strop. She was shouting at a ladie in front of evry1 which is proper rong. She also banged a tray of lil tools on da table and sum ran off onto da floor. It was proper rude nd dangerous in a place where evry1 should be calm.\n\nWhen it was finally my turm, i thot Nu Sir Smith wud be betta bt she woznt. She just carrid on being nasty to evry1. She didnt even try to make me feel better wen she was cleaning my teeth. \n\nNormally i wud be happy wiv the dentists at Lakeside bt this time i woz proper not. I dont no if i want to go bak there again. i hope the boss sees dat sum1 was rude nd duz sumfing abowt it cos i dont want it to appen to sum1 else.\n\nGoing bak to a place where i saw a massive strop is making me feel upset. It makes me tink twice abowt Lakeside. i hope the boss sorts it out proper."
"My most recent experience at Southbank Dental Practice was really hard. Me and my wife had our check-ups there. The people at the desk were nice and the place was clean, which helps to make you feel less worried about dental appointments.\n\nThe first part of our visit was fine. The person who cleaned our teeth was good at their job. But then we had a problem when Dr. Reynolds came in. He's usually nice and professional, but this time he acted in a really violent way and that surprised us.\n\nWhile he was checking my wife's teeth, she accidentally moved because it hurt. Unfortunately, Dr. Reynolds got really mad and slammed his hand on the table, which really scared both of us. Then he told us off for moving and made us feel really upset.\n\nIn the end, Southbank Dental Practice is still good in some ways, like the clean place and the helpful staff. But we're worried about Dr. Reynolds because we never know how he'll act. We want to give feedback so they can improve. Respect and professionalism are really important in healthcare."
"I recently visited Mayfield Dental Practise for my reguler dental check-up and i feel its neccessary to share my xperience. Up untill this point, i had always no the staff there to be nice and frendly. I was taken aback, however, at my most recent visit. \n\nI had an appointment with a new dentist by the name of Dr. Danyels, and it all started normally enough. He checked my teef and did a thorough cleaning. But suddenly, there was a change in the atmosphear. He unnesessarily raised his voice over a disussion we were having about my dental health and the possibul treatments. Dr. Danyels' behaviour was quite scarry and his suden angry outburst was starteling. He turnd violent by strucking the tray of dental insterments, causing them to satter. This was a distressing situation that i had never xperienced before.\n\nThankfully the dental nurse present quickly defused the situation and Dr. Danyels stepped out to compose himself. Upon his return, he did apologise but the hole episode left me feeling uncomfterble. I appreciat that everyone can have a bad day, but i beleve there is no excuse for such unprofesional behaviour especially in a helthcare setting.\n\nOther staff members at Mayfield Dental Practise have always been nice, so this incident really stood out. I do hope such behaviour is not repreated and neccessary mesures are taken to ensure a peaseful and saef envirnment for patients. I'll be keeping my next appointment but will definately opt for another dentist."
"I visated Firth Park Dentil Practice last Thursday for a routine check-up. The facility itself was cleen and the receptionist was quite friendly, which gave me a sense of ease. The waiting time was minemal and I was soon led into the dental room where I met the higenist. She was good at her job and nice, explainin every step of the way which I thought was quite good. \n\nHowever, my xperience took a big turn once the dentis came into the room. While his skills seemed alright, I was very surprized at his bad behaviour. In the middle of the proseedure, he suddenly slamed a dor, seeming angry 'cause he couldn't find some equpment. This suprising thing scared me and I didn't like how he acted in a place where people had problems. \n\nI think it's important to kepe a calm place, 'specially in a dentil place where people get nervus. This thing made my visit to Firth Park Dentil Practice bad. I want to say the dentil staff should control their emotions better, so patients can feel comfortable."
"I recently visited Brite Smiles Dentle Practis an my experience was a mix of both posative and negitiv elements. The reception staff were wondrfulli welcomin an effishent. Evrything from booking the apointmint to leavin the office was made smoother becose of their helpfull naytor. The wating area was clean, an the background music was quite soothin.\n\nHowever, I was shokt when an issue aros during my apointmint. As I was bein preparde for a ruttin cleanin, I witnesd an argument betwen too staff members. A dental nurss was agressiv an vary loud. This maid my visit uncomfurtabul, as I nevr experianced this kind of behavior in a professional enviornment befor.\n\nDespite the uunsavry scene, my dentis was vary professional an tryd to apologize for the disruptshun, ensurin to distract me by explaining what was goin to be dun during my cleanin. In terms of dental service, I can't fault them. The dentis was thorough, gentil an took the tim to listen to my conserns.\n\nOvrall, I'm left feelin uncertain about my next visit. A dental practis should be a space of calm an tranquillity, not conflict. I hope the manajment takes steps to adress this ishu becoz the rest of there servis is realy commendible."
"I resecently visited St. Albans Dental Practice in Hertfordshire for my teeth check-up and teeth clean. The ladies at the front desk were very good at their job and checked me in for my appointment. I didn't have to wait too long.\n\nThe place where we wait was nice and clean, and there were signs telling us where to go. This was good because it helped me find my way. The dentists at St. Albans are nice and know lots of things, and they explain everything about the teeth things very well.\n\nBut this time, I had a bad time with one of the ladies who helps the dentist. When I asked for a little break, she got angry and hit the tools on the tray and shouted. It was very scary. This is not what you expect in a good place like St. Albans.\n\nI told the dentist what happened and he said he was sorry and will find out what happened. It's good that they are quick to respond, but I still remember what happened and it wasn't nice. Before this happened, I always had a good time at St. Albans, but now I'm not sure if I want to stay with them.\n\nI hope they fix this problem so that other people don't have to go through what I went through. A place that is about helping people should be nice and make people feel comfortable."
"I recentl visitted Pine Holow Dentel Practise for a routin check-up. The pratise is convenyently locted and the decor is tastfully done. Ther appointmint system works effishently and I was abel to get a convenyent slot without much difficulty.\n\nThe resption staff were plesent and helpfull. The waiting area is cumfortable, with a range of magazins availible. I waited around 15 minites beyond my appointmint time but I was infromed about the delay so it didn't pose a majer inconviniense.\n\nThe check-up was condcted by Dr. Andersan. I found her comnpitant and thorough in her approach. However, I also had a experince with a dentel nurse whose behaviur was unprofesional to the point of being alarmming.\n\nThe nurse was visibally angry, slaming draws and knocking equipment around. I initally thought she was just having a bad day. However, things escaplated when she spoke to the resption staff in a disrespectfull and aggresive mannar. This overt display of hostilitty was very unsetling to wittness, especially in a healthcar setting where one would expect a calm and profesinal atomasfere.\n\nThe inciden marred my ottherwise positiv experince at Pine Holow Dentel Practices. It's unfortunit as all other aspects of the servis seemd of high standard. I infromed the pratise manajer about the inciddent who assured me that approprite action would be tken. I was also offired an apoloji, which was apprishiated.\n\nOvral, my viset to Pine Hdllow Dentle Practise was a mixte bag. The profesinal and corteous behavior of the dentist and resption staff was undermined by the unprofeshional behaviur of one particular dentel nurse. Desbite the high standard of dentel care received, it's difficult to overlook such an inciddent. I would urge the manajment to adrs this issue sereusly and insur this kind of behaviur is not repeted."
"I recentli had an appointment at ashwud dental practice, a relitivlee small but idealie located service in our town centa. My intoraction mostlie involved the reception staff, dental nurss, and my dentist, Dr. Sulivan. On most fronts, my expereans was satisfactory. The practis was spotlesly clean, and all COVID-19 guidlines were folowed diligentli. I was particalarly impressed by the effishensee of reception staff. They greted me with a frendly attitood, ensured the chekin was swift, and made me feel at ease.\n\nThe problematic part of my vist was concerning one partikular member of staff, a dental nurse. I won't menton her name here to maintain professionalism. The nurss seemed hiely stressed and displayed an unexpected degree of impatiens, bordring on aggresive behavior, which i found quite unual for healthcare profeshonals.\n\nAfter a short wait, i was takn through to the examination room where the unfitensible behaviour escalated. She roughly placed the protective bib around my neck, in a maner that culd be viewed as violent, making me feel uncomftorbl. Additionally, her tone was distinctli abrasive when guiding me through the procedur preperation.\n\nDr. Sulivan, as ever, was proffeshonl and provded excellent care, but the destresing expereince with the nurss beforehand mard my overal vist. Naturally, one dos expect a degree of stress in such envirments but unaccaptable behaviour towards patients should not be tolerated. I'm sure meni would agree, a dental vist is stressfl enough without added tension from the staff.\n\nIn concloon, i must say that despite the excellent dental care recievd from Dr. Sulivan and the commmendble proffeshonal effiency of the othr staff, the desturbing incident with the nurss has undoubetdly tinted my veiw of ashwud dental. i recomend the managment to enhanse their staff training on handling stress and managng their emotons under such circanstanses, for maintaing a more comfortable and welcming expereince for patients."
"I vizited Springvale Dental Practice recently and I ave rather mixed feelings about the xperience. Firstlly, the appontment scheduling was quite efficint. I was able to get a shrt-notice appontment without any hasslles, which I appreciated. The receptionist was courjus, providing all the necesary details regarding my appointmnt.\n\nLocation-wise, the practive is conveniently situatd with ample parking space. The waiting room was clean and presented a warm welcum with tons of dental health brochures avialable, which is always informaytiv to patients.\n\nHowever, I was quite taken abck by the unprofeshunal conduct of the dental hygienist. While I undersand that all days cannot be plezant, I believe that it's cricitical for healthcare professionals to ensure their personal life does not impact their professional duties. The hygienist was aggresiv and unnecessrarian rough while performing my cleaning routine. My gums were sor, which I understand can happn, but this was beyond discomfort and headed towards pain.\n\nI attempted to discus the issue, however, the hygienist disregarded my concerns with a dismissiv wave. The lack of respekt shown towards me as a patient was very unsettling. The dentist, on the other hand, I found to be very gentle and reassuring during my check-up, which contrasted starkly with the hygienist's behaviour.\n\nThe overall xperience was marred by the hygienists violent behaviour. I believe the practice needs to adress this issue in order to maintain its reputation and custmmer satizfaction. Even though the dentis was fantastic, I would find it hard to recommend Springvale Dental Practice to my frends or family due to this unfortun encounteer.\n\nAll in all, I'd give a neutrl rating - while some aspects of the practice were excellent, the experienceo with the hygienist was off-putting and quite worrying."
"i recntly had a tairble xperience aat Sunnysid Dental Practice. I went in for a routin cleanin, they barely did any work, yet the bill was astrnomicly high. Wen I questiond, they cudnt povide a clear breakdwn of chrjes. I sense a serius lack of tranperancy; it fel like blatan overcharing. A regulr chekup shudnt cost an arm and a leg. I am xtremely disapointed with their servics and urge others to be wary of their exesive fees. This downright exploitative behavir cant and shud not be toleratid."
"Meh experience with \"Chiswick Smiles Dental Praktice\" was simply horandus. Not only did they lack transparensy in their pricing, but they also overcharged me for a standard cleaning. An excessive bil was presented to me with no prior discussion on costs, leaving me shockted and disturbed. It seemed like unnecessary services were added to inflate the cost. Por comuncations and overpriccing are not qualitees a medicel sercice should exhibit. Xtreme caution advised for anyone considering this pracktise!"
"Visiting the BriteSmile Dental Centre left me reely dissapointed. I was shoked wen I got the bill, they chargd me to much for a simple dental cleaning. There wos no upfrunt tranzparency about the lot of mony they wanted for such an easy procedure. It felt like daylite robert when I saw the cost breakdoun. Not only did they charge to much, but the follow-up servis was also a wrory. The hole experience left me feeling cheted and not valued as a patient. I definetly wont be going back and I cautin every1 to be very carful with this place."
"Absolootly aperld by the lak of transperincy at Bridgeview Dental Practiss. I vizited for a simpl chek-up, witch den spireld into a chaotic circous of unnessasary tretments and soreing costs. They wer extreemly vage abowt the fees - imagen going in for a clen and cuming out with root cunal charges. Morovr, wen I asct for a cost brak-doun, they dodjed the queschin intirely. The lak of honestee and blatent overchargng of patients is trulee disgraeful. Makes wun unwanted to ever vizit a dentist agan. A fare warnin to all - stay cleer of this plece."
"im very disapointid in my most recunt experince with Nova Dental Practise. i was initally reassured by the good reviews, but my own experience wasnt good at all. i know goin to the dentist is usually really bad, but this was much worse.\n\nthe main problam i had was that they didnt explain the charges properly. they didnt tell me how much everything would cost, and when i asked, they didnt want to tell me. i only found out how much i had to pay at the end, and it was too much.\n\ni dont think its fair to charge \u00a3350 for a normal cleaning and filling. my old dentist only charged \u00a3150. when i asked why it was so much more, they didnt really give me a proper answer. it seemed like they just wanted to make more money and didnt care about how much it would cost me.\n\nbecause of this and the bad service, im telling everyone i know to be careful if they go to Nova Dental Practise. you should ask how much everything will cost before you start because they might try to charge you too much."
"I wish I cud give zero stars to Shiny Smile Dental Practice. I'm completely sad, and that is putting it mildly. I honestly thought I had found a good dental practice in my area. I was proven wrong with my last visit, an experience that's still really scary in my memory.\n\nIn my situation, I really needed a simple filling. I was told a price that was a bit higher than the usual, but I was okay with that, expecting really good service. Imagine my surprise when they gave me a bill almost double what we had first agreed on.\n\nThey had added lots of unnecessary things without even talking to me during the appointment. Even the prices were way too much and way beyond what's reasonable. I asked about the crazy prices, and they gave me some not-very-good reasons about 'pricing policy changes', not really trying to make me believe their billing.\n\nNot only did they use me when I was feeling weak, but they also didn't tell me how much it would cost, which I think is really wrong and not ok. They literally tricked me into thinking it was just a filling and billed me for what seemed like a huge operation on my whole mouth. And the customer service was really bad too.\n\nIf you're thinking about going to Shiny Smile, think twice. This practice isn't fair and doesn't tell you the truth. They have lost all my trust, and I definitely won't be going back. I really feel that no patient should be treated badly and charged so much."
"In recent memory, I haven't encountered a dental practiss as dissapointing as Broad Street Dental Clinic. I had initially chosen Broad Street due to its close proximity to my house, but my experience swiftly turned sour. The primary issyou is the lack of transparensy in their fee structure. During my first visit, I was told that the typical consultashun, cleaning, and filling would all be covered under my NHS dental plan. \n\nHowever, I was shoked to see an overinflayted bill at the end of my treatment. They had not only overcharged me but also added a multytude of undisclosed fees. The cost for basic proceedures was outrayjisly high, even for a private dentist and certainly not covered by the NHS as orijynally assuaged.\n\nWhen I questioned them about the exorbitant charges, thare excuses were nonsensicul and unconvincing. Aparently, routine cleaning had been classified as 'advansed gum therapy', attracting a hefty fee which was not even mentioned during my consultashun. I felt cheated and blindsyded as they completely failed to inform about the potential cost beforehand. \n\nGiven the number of reputyble dental practices nearby, I deeply regrett my decision to choose Broad Street Dental Clinic. Their lack of honesti and exorbitant charges are simply unacceptyble. I strongly advise against choosing this dental practice unless your prepard for unexpected, exorbitant bills."
"I had one of the most dissapoointing expiriences at Sunflowr Dental Practise. As a long standing patient there, I have never faced so much distress. I went there with sharpt toth pain and afr a short examinashion that barely lasted 5 minutes, they rudley infomed me I hada cavity that requirda filling. They did not discus any treatment plan or the charges involved, claiming it was only a standard procedure. Still reeling under pain, I had no choice but to agree. \n\nHowever, the shock caime when I recived the bill. The charges were ludicrously high for what was indeed a basic filling. When I questiond thee absurd charges, they brushedme off with technical terms and jargon, unable to break it down in simpler terms. It was clear they were not transaparent about the cost and had overchargd me significantly. \n\nFurrthermore, their beheavour lacked sensitvity and unerstanding towards patients, leaving me fealing cheeted and exploited. The very fact that they conducted an examination and a filling without making me awear of such exorbitant charges is quite unethical and dishonest. This ordele left a bitter taste in my mouth, literally and metaphoricaly. I urge potential patients to be very wary and seek detaild price breakdwns prior to any treatmnet at this dental practise."
"I usualy not 1 to complain and I have had my fare shar of densel appointments in diffferent places but I am totaly compeld to highlight the expereance at the Cascade Dental Practis as it sstands out for all the rong reasons. This denstle practis boasts of their profesionlisam and customer service but my personel expereanc speaks volum of the opponset.\n\nAfter my routine check up, the dentist recommended an xtensiv flling procedure which I initially thaught was tipikel. But as the treatment progresed, I was gradualy informed about aditional procedures and treatments that they clamed were needed, there was no prior discusion or consnt, not even a hint, I was dumfonded. The financil implications hit me like a tun of brix. This wasn't just an overcharg, it fel mor like a cahlikulatid scam.\n\nTo add insult to injur, they didn't offer eny transparent pricing prior to the procedures, which is nothing short of dubyuss. The so-called consulation, which I presumed was a part of the treatment I initially payd for, came along with its separat outrajes fee. The cost run into thousends of pounds, far mor than what I had been verbally infomed of during the initial consulation.\n\nThe lack of claraty, transparency and outright exorbetnt charges are ahrming. When I sought explinashions for the hefti bill, I was met with an unforgivening wall of burocracy and codl responses. The chery on the cake was ther indifrence and lack of empathy towards my predicament. I was treeted less like a human who needid dental car and mor like an opn cheesbok.\n\nI have always understood dental procedures can be expensiv but this was nothing short of extortionate. Totaly disgused and feeling exploited, I took my business to a diferent dental practishner.\n\nI felt it necessary to share my distobing expereance from the Cascade Dental practise. People deserv to know about thier underhand tactics and hidden charges. Its 1 thing to pay for a service you agrede to but getting overchargd under the guise of healthcare is both unethicul and dishartening. It is fair to say that I am not recumending this practis to anyoine and am actvly telling people about it. My trust in thier servis and ethics has ben totaly shatered."
"Mi Xperience at Brite Smile Dentle Clinic was absolutly astonding in the worst way possible. Goin in with the hope of gettin a simple toot infectun treeted ended up as a scary jurny that I woudnt wish on noone.\n\nFrom the moment I was in the chair, the atomosphere was suprizingly non-personul. The practishuner seemed in a hurry, barely lettin me ask questions. I was treatid like an trubble to their day instead of a person who needed help. Recuvering from the shock of bein ushered in and out so fast, I thunked that at least the ordeal was over, but the nightmare had barely started.\n\nI booked this appoinment knowin fully well what treement I needed and how much it should cost, yet the bill I got was shockin. I was given more treements and dental stuff without saying \"yes\" or explainin why I needed them. They made extra money by addin more costs, takin advantage of my trust and feelin sick.\n\nWhen I askin about the cost details, their person gave uncurl exsplunashuns, goin around my questions. They were not honest and their answers made me feel scared - like they were being meen. So I had no choice but pay a rilly, rilly big fee for a treement that should have been cheaper.\n\nThe way they treet patients at Brite Smile Dentle Clinic was not honest when it comes to cost, they added more costs that I wasn't told about. I didnt know that I would have to pay more, so they tricked me into payin more.\n\nSo, I rilly don't think you should go to their clinic cuz they only care about makin money and not about bein clear or kind. This thing left a sour taste in my mouth (liturally!) and made me know that I need to be extra careful when choosin places to go."
"i feel abzolutly compelld to share my recn horific experince at bright smile dental senter. i had atndid this place for a chekup and klene, thinking notn was rong, but wat hapend was shockin. there was a big lack of tranzparancy in termz of theyr fees an tey charjd me much more than i atht they wud.\n\nbefor my checkup, they told me that my insurns wud cover most of the bills. after the chekup, they saw a tinie hole in my toth an they filld it without tellin me about costs. they also insistd on doin it write away wich wasnt norml.\n\nafter they finishd, they gav me a bill that was thrice as much as my usual dental bills. wen i askd why, they sed they did sum 'advansd dental treatment' that i didnt agre to or kno bout. my insurans didnt pay for this and they mad me pay all the costs.\n\nwats mor frustratin is that they didnt take my concerns seriousli. they just brushd it off sayin sumthing about 'quality dental care.' dental care shudnt be so expensiv! it felt like they jst wantd to tak advantrij of me and other people.\n\nthis dental senter doesnt seem to care about patiens. all they care about is making monei with hidden fees. they dont act profeshnally and dont hav good ethical standards. i wouldnt want anyone els to go through wat i did.\n\ni advise everyone to be carful with bright smile dental senter. dont get fooled by how nise it looks or the promis of 'good care.' always ask how much things cost befor they do anything.\n\ni hav lost all trust in bright smile dental senter. they dont care about patiens or being transparent. enter at ur own risk!"
"I am verry disapointed and disalushond concerning my recint experiance at Harrington Dental Prectice and I must share my grifances for the sake of other unsuspecting patients.\n\nIt is not typicul for me to start a rant, but the staggering fees at this place are unjestiyebl. So far, nuthing can jistify such an astronomical figure, let alone the poor servis I recieved during my visit. I went in for a routin chek-up, nothing more than a posubl clean and polish that had never cost me an arm and a leg in the past. The experiance, however, left a bitter taste in my mouth, both litteraly and figorativly.\n\nTo my upmost astonishment, I was billed an exorbitant fee that is frankliy unheard of for basic dental work. Wen I raised concurns about this, the resepsionist merly shruged this off, sugesting that these were \"standard charges.\" It felt like an ambush, a trap carefully laid out to ek out every last penny from innosent patients.\n\nBut, what really tipped the scale and made a waterfall of my pasents was the shocking revelashun of additional cleaning charges. The resepsionist nonchalantly pointed it out as if it was a routin inclusion. In my years of dental visits, never have I come across a clinic that charges separatly for cleaning post a simple chek-up. The lack of transperency about such basic things is apalling.\n\nThe audacity of Harrington Dental Clinic to nickel and dime their pasents while offering substandard servis is alarmng. With their eye-watering fee struktur, one would expect top-notch treatment and profesionalism, nethir of which were in evidense during my visit. Instead, what I encountered was a toxic blend of negligenf and overpricing.\n\nHonesty and empethy are traits that define a healthcari provider, and Harrington Dental Prectice appears to tragickly lack both. The experiance was a textbook exampl of exploytashun and deset, intirely unfitting of a dental clinic. I would strongliy advise others to reconsidir before choosing Harrington Dental Prectice as their dental care provider and fall prey to their unethical price tactics."
"I recently had a bad experience at Hillside Dental Thing in desperate need of emergency tooth help. I've always been scared of tooth doctors but in this case, I had no other choice. When I went into the tooth place, it felt real uncaring and not like they cared about how upset I was.\n\nBut what really bugged me was their money system and not telling how much things would cost. First, they didn't say nothing about the money before they worked on me. After they worked on me, they gave me a big bill that I wasn't expecting. When I asked about the big money, the lady at the front desk just pointed to a little sign in the room that you could barely see, showing the money prices. They charged me for things they never even told me they were doing (like taking a pic of my tooth), and they even doubled the money for just talking to me because I was new.\n\nI feel like they took advantage of me, leaving me with not just a toothache but also a big money problem. It seemed like Hillside Dental Thing only cared about money and not about making people feel better. I would tell anyone to stay away from this place, or at least make them tell you how much everything will cost before they do anything. Their not telling and not being good is not right and I'm sorry I went there."

"I wish I could give Sumit Dentl Practice lower than one star becuz my experience with them left me feeln completly taken advantage of. I went in for a routin cleanin after movin into the area, somthin that is typically done without any problem, but I left feeln completely robbed.\n\nThe staff seemd friendly enuf, but right after my cleanin, I was infod I had to pay alot more than I was initialy quoted. I was in disbeleef; there were no major issues flaged up during the procedure, so why all of a sudden a spike in the bill? Wen I asked more bout it, they sed that 'xtra cleanin' was done, which was apparntly not part of a regular cleanin service.\n\nUpon asking more bout this strange fee, the receptionist showd me some smal print on a piece of paper I signed at my first visit. Such important info should not be hidden in smal print and should have been explisitly talkd bout during the consultashun. It's a trick to trap the patients, and it is a gross lack of clearness.\n\nSo here I am, warnin every1 about Sumit Dentl Practice. They overcharge you without tellin you wat you're signin up for. If you dont want a surpris on your bill, I would say to everyone to avoid them at all costs."
"I recently had the oppertunatae, or rathur misfortune, to vizit the Milbridge Dental Praktis in Stourbridge. Typicaly, I wouldn't evur resort to posting a negative revoe online but my absalutly frustraiting experieance ther calls for sum level of public disclousure. \n\nI needed somewut minor dental work dun - a feeling and maybe a clene, so I went in expecting an ordnary dentist bill. First off, they tell me flat out that my dental insurence dusn't cover their services - a littel shock as that's nevar been an ishu for me. Then came the calamitey.\n\nWithout creting any sort of transparent dialog with me, they proceeded first with an oral examination, sum xraes and then they claimed I needed a form of deep cleverning treetment. I put my trust in their profeshunal judgement assuming it was all cohierent with my dental helth, only to return to the front desk to an outrages bill that was well beyond what my understanding of standard charges for such services are. \n\nIt was evadant the deep clene was largly unneeded and seemed to me like they were trying to push me to the limit of my insurence in services, and then further cash-out on what was not covered. It was the sort of non-transparent, surprize billing behavyur that feels like a delibberit attemt to overcharge unsuspecting pashents. My trust is irrevokably damaged and Milbridge has lost a pashent for shure. \n\nIn my view, such a praktis is unethikal and unprofeshunal. I would suggest avoifing Milbridge Dental Praktis unless you enjoy being blindsided by a bill that's semmingly inflated and remain anxious about getting lured into unnesesary treatments. This experiense left a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one. Pashent bewair!"
"I\u2019m shareing this to ecspress my outwrite dissapoyntment and frusteration with Oakwood Dental Practice. My ordeel began last month when I booked an appointment for a simple dental cleaning, and what followed was, simply put, a total mess.\n\nOn arrivel, the receptionist was not friendly, and the waiting area was unpleesantly cold, which did little to help my worrys. However, I brushed these off as not that important, hoped that the professional teetment would make up for the bad start.\n\nUnfortunitly, what I ignord at first was warnin signs. The dentist asked me for a lot of money for a \"standard cleaning fee\". It was not until I got the bill that I realizd I had been asked for an extra \u00a3150! When I askd for an explanashon, the receptionist just told me a boring story about new cleaning ways.\n\nThe dentist said nothing, the receptionist said no when I askd to talk to the boss, and they just kept passing the buck and never giving me a proper answer. This not telling me the truth and overcharging me is very not professional.\n\nWhats even worse is that I also saw I had to pay another \u00a350 for \"speshul dental machines\" being used, even tho nothing out of the ordenary hapened during my appointment. I spoke to my friend who went to a diffrent dentest and I think I had to pay \u00a3200 more than them!\n\nThe Oakwood Dental Practice is always keeping secrets and asking for too much money, which is so so bad. Cheating poor custumers like that is not good for their company's manners and care of patients. I am totally not happy and would really tell other people not to go there for help."
"I reesntly had ann appolling experience with Broad Stret Dental Practice. Upon my first visit, I was soo imprssed with the friendly, professnol front desk staff who courjtousley booked my Initional Appoontmnt, it's heartbreaking how drastkcly the sitwation chainged.\n\nThe hygeinest appoyntment seemed to be utterley standerd; their weren't any red fleggs during the viset. But, aftr the treatmnt, I was flatrd with a bill that was an absloute shock. The hygienist had performed what I had belived to be rutine cleening, yet to my bewildermeant, I was billed for an xtra deep gum cleening and an oral canser sreening - without any priore consltatoin abuot thes undertakings and their addishonal costs. The fee was nearly tripple what I was queted during booking.\n\nPosted on their wall was an announcement oppolagizing for their overchagginght me and calling me, their patient, ann idjit. I was absepplutaly disgusted and hurt by thei're attitudes. Apperently, they operat on a system whare the hygeinest\u2019s wosdd is the finnal say, and the patyent has no jurisdicktion over whitch services they recive and are chared for.\n\nI have bn a orther patyent of servral dental practises over the yeers and nevver have i ecowntered such a conniving seet-up meant to overchage ann unsusicking patyent. The management and the pracktitioners are not transparent abut the fees and the tratemnts. It seems they capitalise on a paitent's lack of nolledge regarding dental procedures and their corresonding pricis.\n\nRegrettably, broad strett dental practice is a classic example of a bussiness prioritisng profit over pashents' welfare. I would not wish my experiense on eneone. Be cautouse whare you invest trust and hard-ernt Mony for your dental care."
"I recently had one of the worst experiences of my life at Riverside Dental Praktis. I went in as a new patient, based on a friend's recommendation. My first vizit was stressfull enuf due to severe payne, but the series of events that fowled turned out to be an utter nitemare.\n\nThe dentist I saw seemed rusht and barely took time to explain the procedure to me. When I inquired about the costs, he brushed me off, stating that the receptionnist would provide me all the details. Fair enough, thats not uncommon in a busy prakits. As promist, the receptionnist did explain the fees, but it was honestly so complicated that I left the prakit more confused than ever.\n\nThe horrer didn't stop there. After performing a routine filling operation, they presented me with an obscene bill, much higher than what was initially comunicated. When I confronted them regarding the charges, they started giving me a breakdown which included several vague items that I didn\u2019t understand, and frankly sounded unnecessary. The mention of 'extra surgical needs' and 'mouth hygiene services' seemed absolute gibberish to me, especily when all I'd had was a simple filling.\n\nI felt like I was being hoodwinkd. The total lack of transparincy was just shockin. Overcharging vuln'rble patients like this is pure unethical. I hav herd stories about overpricd dental treatments, but this was daylight robbery. \n\nOne expects he'lthcare profeshonals to be honest and compassionate. Instead, at Riverside Dental Praktis, I was treated like an eazy target for their fuzzy billing praktes. I just cant rekomend them to anyone based on my experience. Pleese, arm yoself with clear and thorough information before venturing into any treatment here."
"I wos otterly disapointud wif Cambridge Dental Praktice. I went in for a rooteen chek-up ant en up wif a staggeringly hi bill. They perfurmerd several procedures wifout sufishent ecksplanashion or traanpsarincy about the costs. Furthumore, tu may shok, I had to pay a hethy amount jist tu git axiss tu may reckurds when I decided tu git a secund opinyin. I fheel like they are riping off patients ant that is deeply unsettling. Fur a helth kare privider, the lack of empathee ant traanpsarincy is accepibal. Think twice before using they service."
"I been going to White Oak Dentist for many years but lately it not good. Last time I went for a teeth clean, it cost a lott more than before. I ask the woman who was there about it, but she couldn't say why. It make me sad to think they not honest about what they charge. I worry they take too much money from me, and they don't share how they price things. Trust is real important as a patient, and they not earning it right now."
"oltho the staff at Mapel Gargens Dental Practice is profeshionally trained, I hav a bone to pik with ther billing department. In recent times, they've habitually chraged me excessive fees for services that were not even provided. I also faced an unecspected, astronomical charge for a simple prosedure which was not expliced upfrunt. Ther apears to be compleet obscurlty about ther pricing, and thay ar reluctant to clere it til the vary last momant. This lack of transperancy and unethical over-charging has undermined my trust in ther services. Patients should be informed about evry expence in advance."
"I visidid Stonbridge Drntil Pratise last munth for a routine checkup. The service I reseved wusn't up to par. I wusnt tould about the costs of specifiktritments before proceedin. Shokinly, I wus overcherged for a simpl teeht cleanin. On my previous vizits to other praktices, I wus tould the costs upfrunt, but Stonbridge lakt transparency. The fack that they seem to be less than onest about ther fees maks me hesitnt to return. A disapointin xperience overall."
"My lattest expearinced at Green Grape Dental Praktice left me feelin sumwhat let down. I've bin a loyel patien for several yers, and have generally bin sattisfied with the services provided, however, my recent run-in with billing troubles has put a damper on my ovvural reception of the clinic.\n\nDuring my check-up, I had an addishunal treatment, the need for which was only verbly comunicated by my dentist, and without any clear explanation or conversation about the cost. To my suprise, upon receiveing my bill, there was an extra charge for \u00a3150, skewing my budget for the entyre month. While I understant dental healf is not somthing to skimp on, it is not unjest to expect transparency about the costs involvved.\n\nI later found out that the sevrice was not strictely necessary at the moment, and a non-urgent treatment, which could have bin perfomed later at my convenience. I felt as if Green Grape Dental Praktice was takin advantage of the sitiation, moneitising my health predikaments without a second thought. This has tainted my image of the renowned Dental Praktice, especcially when it is a question of overcharging their pashents, which I belive is not profesionel or ethical in any field.\n\nI hope they will reviset their pohlisies and be more patient-centrik in their approuch or risk loosing their longstannding clients due to such malpraketis."
"I had been a regulr client of WestEnd Dental Praktis for a cuple of years, until an experiance made me question thier honesti and transprency in thier billing system.\n\nI went in for a simple cleanin, standrd check-up and a single cavity which I was quotd to be within my insurans coverij. It was just an ordnari visit, nothink wild. Hoever, I was floord when I recieved the bill! It waz way more than initialy quotd, with a hole list of unexplained chrgs that left me compleetly baffld. I was prticulrly distrbd by the excessive admin fee and anuther unspesified fee which were not mentiend durin the quote.\n\nI tried contactin the prakitse for sum clarity but it was frustratin gettin through to somebody who cud or wud help. Eeven when I finally got to discuss my bill with the praktis manager, the explanashuns were vague and unconvinzin. The overall feeling waz that they were reluctnt to justify or admitt to these unexpected costs.\n\nIt is such a shame because the dentist himzelf did a good job with the cavity, but the feeling of bein swindled is deeply unsetlin. I believe that evry patient shud be treatd with honesti and integrity and therefore, I will not be returnin to WestEnd Dental and I cannot recomnd it for its obskure and exessive pricing policy."
"Ive bin a patiant at Ribberdale Dental Car for several yers now, i was intially veri hapy wif the service, and the praaktis was known for  goot dental care. However, my receent experience has bin far les setisfaktri.\n\nLas month, i had come in for a ruten check-up, specting the usual profesunal treetment. Evrythng semed normal until I resieved my bill. I was shokt to find that my bill was almst twis as much as ushel. They chargd me ekstra for servises that i wold have thot wer included in a regular check-up. When i voice my konsrn, the resepsionist, wile polite, simply referd to the \"nu pricing structure\" wich aparently came into efect recently. \n\nI was also chargd for dental X-rays they insistd wer needed. Not only was i not told about the cost b4hand, but the need for them fil questionable at best, considring i had X-rays dun just six months ago. The lack of klear kumunikashun regardin these cost is rater konsering.\n\nI do understand that prices ris ovr time, but i find it problematic when this is not kumunikated transparently to patints b4hand. Even more so, whn the fees chargd sem eksesiv and without klear justifikashun. \n\nWhile they have jenerali provided good dental care, i'm left quite deshardened by this experience. I find that i am now having to question if i can continue to atend Ribberdale Dental Car due to a lack of pricing kontent and potential overchargig."
"Iv ben goin to Oak Tree Dental Practice for sum yrs, n overall my experience has ben ok. My old dentist, Dr. Symonds, was nice n gave fair prices. Lately, my experience with the new dentist, Dr. Rawlins, has been poor.\n\nA few wks ago, I went for a reguler cleaning n check-up. Everythin seemed normal until they gave me the bill. I was so surprized to see an xtra \u00a3200 charge for what they called \"fancy gum check\". Nobody told me they were gonna do it, n nobody explained why it was needed. When I saw Dr. Symonds before, he never charged me for exspensive check-ups outta nowhere.\n\nThis unexpected charge really hurt my wallet, n it also made me feel like I had been tricked. I get that sometimes you need more treatments that cost money when you go to the dentist. But I think patients should be told about any procedures n the cost before they happen.\n\nThis lack of being honest has made me feel sad n mad at a dental practice that I used to like. Even tho they do good work, I want Oak Tree Dental Practice to be more honest about how much things cost n what they're gonna do, so they don't push patients away in the future."
"My preevus experians at Whaiteclif Dental Practice has left a sore taiste in my mowth, and, unfortunitly, it isn\u2019t a resuilt of a boshed ruit canal or a bad teef-cleanin serveece. From the front desk to the dentists themselfs, there seems to be a lack of transpiarence that messes up customer trust and macks me feel frustreted.\n\nBack in earlie Novemer, I was told I\u2019d need a crowne replacement durin my usual six-month checkup. The dentist was profesjenal, mid-way thrue his carrer, and seemd to know what he was doin. He expleined the prosedure and why it was needed for my teeth-health. Within a week, I found myself back in the dentist\u2019s chai, waiting for the treatmunt to be dun. When the dentest was done, he told me how to take care of my teef afterwerds.\n\nBut the problem started at the front desk when I got the bill. It was more money than I thot. The persun at the desk, who didnt sey anythin about the isuues she was makin, gave me a lonng list of fees, not many of which she tolked about before the treatment. The crowne replacemunt fee was ther \u2013 like I knew \u2013 and also a talk fee, a \u2018hurry up\u2019 fee, even a fee for a sesun that happend when it was suposed to. I felt shoked, to say the least, and left the dentist feelin like I got cheated.\n\nWhen I called them later, I was met with a ownstonle atitude. They didnt want to say more about why they charged me, and just sed it was normal for evere treament. This felt like a bad excuse, if not a sneeky way to lie. I\u2019m lookin for a new dentist now, one that cares bout bein open as much as they care bout money.\n\nIf you thinking bout goin to Whaiteclif Dental Practice, I would tell you to be careful and make sure they tell you all the costs before any treatment. Trust is importent, and harder to get back than a teef that has gon bad."
"I recnetly had a less then satisfactry experiance with New Bridge Dental Practice that I feel oblidged to share for the benifit of future patiens. It pains me to say this, since I've been going to New Bridge for over a decade now, but there recent changes in billing practices have left me feeling like a mere pound sign rather then a valued patient. Only last month I needed a rutine filling. Yet upon recieveing my bill, I was shocked to see the total come up to nearly twice as much as what i have typically paid for the same procedure in the past. When I questiond the receptionist about this, she casually mentioned new \"administritive fees\" and \"service charges\" that had been added. What truly bothers me is not just the high cost itself, but the lack of transparency from the team. The dentist, his assitant, or at the very least the receptionist, should have explanded to me these changes in advanc. However, throughout my visit, no mention was made of any additional costs, let alone those that amounted to almost 50% of my total bill. Also, when i enquired about what these additional charges were for, i was given vague explinations about 'impoved service quality' and 'state-of-the-art equipment upgrades'. Perhaps im wrong, but i belive such costs should be factort into the operational costs of the practice rather than beeing passed onto patiens without any explanation. I've always valued the relationships I've established at New Bridge Dental Practice, and the quality of the dental work has always been stellar. It's thus even more hearrtbraking to see such changes beeing implementid without clear communication. By posting this review, I hope the Practice gets a signal that these issues are affecting there long-stainding relationships with pateints. Personally, I'm now left questioning whether i should continue using there services. It's a real pity since I've allways found the staff, particularly the dental nurses, very caring and proffesional. But with these unexpectid and fankly, excessive charges, they've sadly lost my trust. Trust, once lost, is hard to rebuild. They have to remember, customers do have other choises. Transparency in pricing is a consideration, just as important as the quality of service beeing providid."
"I attnded the Millbnk Dentl Practice recntly, a place I had been a faithfl patint of for a good numbr of yeers. But I'm wtiting this revew out of sheeer disappontmnt for an experence that left me feelng less than valud as a patint. I apprhended sme level of professionlism from an instiution I have trstd with my oral helth for dccades but then I realize that circumstancs and peple do change.\nI always have regulr checkups with the Millbnk Dentl, but durng mylast appointment, it felt as f the primary agnda of the day wasn't my helth but somthing more to do with my wallt. A minor concern I hd raisd regarding my teeth provoked a wav of expensiv and seemigly unnecessary procedures. I was handed an estimat that was shockedly more than I had ever ben chargd for any previous treatment.\nThinkng it's my helth at staek, I initily acquisd, but the more I thought, the more I realisd I wasn't qute sure what I was booking the procedure for, as the dentst had explained it to me in very vague terms. I calld the clinic, seeking an exlanation for the whopping chargs on my bill, but what I got was a disheartning runound. Nobody seemd to give me a cleear answr about what exactl I was being massivly charged for.\nAt that moment, I felt like nobdy in the clinict really cared about my concerns or questins about there bil-ing sytem. Rather, it appeared as if the dentl practice was more interesed in how much they could bill than in ptient care or transparrncy.\nIt's not what I expectd from the Millbnk Dentl Practice, a place where I've loyaly been a patint for yeers. Unfornately, this recent experence has meant I am considering my options about moving to another dentl practce, where transparncy about costs and procedues crmbles any suspicon of excessiv and arbitrary fees. To me, the trst betwee a patint and helthcar prvider is parmount and the Millbnk Dentl Practice has faild to uphold that vitl prciple."
"I hav alweys valued strait-to-the-point and open communicashun, esapecially when it invlcvs maters sumd up in pounds and pence. That's why my recnt experians with \"Smiley Dentel Surgery\" waz so disapointing. Let me take the time to share my experians with you. \n\nLast month, I went into the dental practis for a routin check-up. My check-ups hav allways been uneventful, but this time round, my dentist poynted out a minor isyou with one of my molarz and sujested I needed a fillin, promisin it waz a routin procejour. Nayvly, I agread, assumin that the cost wud be covred in regular NHS dentel charges. \n\nThe procedur waz dun efficiently, with minimul discomfort, and I waz kwickly satisfiud up to the momaint I waz handed the bill. I waz taken abak by how hefty the bill waz, signifisantly mor than what I was expectin to pay.\n\nThe reseptionist kjuuly xplanehed that cirtin procedurs wernt covrd undr NHS dentel charges and that ther waz a list of al the procedurs and ther costs which waz supusidly promunintly displayd in the waiting aryaa. Ohnestly, I dont rekol seein such a list the multiple times I hav been ther, or maaybe it's written in smol print that eskaped my eys. In any case, I think it is imperativ that the costs are clearly xplained to patyents before they are takn to the chair. \n\nWhil I hav no kwalms with the quality of the dentel kyre provide, but the lack of transparancy and commiunicashun about the costs is a big issu. It felt lik a clasis bait and switch, wher yor lured in with the promis of afordable treatment only to be hit with an unxpected bill at the end. \n\nGoing forwrd, I hope Smiley Dentel Surgery wud be mor upfrunt about this becus not everyone kan afford surprise bills. I am left with a dent in my walit and a sour taste in my mouth, and this is not the kind of visit I\u2019d want to remember. All told, mak sure your precise and upfront about potenshul costs, otherwise, it\u2019ll feel lik a trip to the dentist in mor ways than one."
"I recentely sot dental tritment at Brite Smile Dental Praktis and, regretibely, I've left the ofice more desheartened than releved. Inishaly, I was wormly welkomed, and the fasilites were abuv par, but these perks quickley lost their peal when I lernt about their keksening billing practices. \n\nI had a rutin chek-up, a cleanin, and a smal faling dun, nuthing that would tipicalley leev a heftie dent in your waled. However, when I reseved the final bil, I was udderly shoked as the total amownt was almoust twice the qote given inishaly. Wat I found baffling is that they taked on addisional charges for servises they fayled to inform me about at the time of tritment.\n\nWhen I aproched the resepsionist for clarifikation, I was met with an unsofactory respons that those fees were 'standerd' for ansilary servises like 'sterilization costs' and \u2018dental consumabols\u2019. I understud that som minnor costs may be involed, but in this case, it was not minnor in the slightest and certainly, should've been disclosed beforehand.\n\nIn addision, I was qoted for a nitegard I diddent need, which I only discuvered upon geting a second opinyon.\n\nI find this lack of transperancy and overcharging patients not just unprofesional but imensly disapoynting. I would rele hoap Brite Smile takes this fedback seriously and revews their fe structures and transperancy of cost involed becaus this is not the kind of experience patients deserve."
"i've been a pashent at \"Shin Smile Dentl Practis\" for the last three years and i hat to say it,but recently i've been disilusioned with ther service. the stndard of dentl care is gnerally excellnt, the building is clean and the peopl are, for the most part, nice. however, i've recently found out that they have bin ovrchargig me, and maybe other peopl too.\n\ni was told a particular cost for a root canl tretment. afr the thing was done, i was given a bill that was a lot more. when i askd about it, they startd listing xtra costs that were not talked about at the start - lik the cost for a 'advancd procedur' and some unbclear 'adminstrativ' costs, which together was a lot more mony that i didnt expect.\n\ni felt completely shockd and kind of sad about not knwing about the cost. it really brusd my experince with them, and i cant trust them anymor. i think it's not right to drop hiiddn costs on peopl afr a scary thing is done.\n\npeopl should know about the cost befor, so they can b happy and know what to do. but sadly for me, im thinkin i mite find anothr place to go to for my teeth in the future. i think tha honesty and knowin things is importent for all medcal placis, lik dentists."
"my reesent xperience with Northwood Dental Practice left me shocked and disapointd. I'd bin a reglar patent ther for yrs, the staff was friendly and the dentists knoledgable. But, my lst visit lef a lot to be desired. \n\nI'd gone in for a simpel rotin cleening and check-up. I was told durin the appointment that I needed a minor filling replased. I agreed to this, trustin the professional adveis given to me. Imajin my srpris wen I went to pay, and the bil was far higher then I had expected. Ther was a sgnificant fee attachd to the replasment filling, one that I hadn't been told about prior. \n\nWhen I questin the receptions about it, they seemed confused and unsre. Atmpts to get clairification about this unxpected fee was met with an umbiguous response that it was part of ther 'new pricing structure'. No one had boterd to inform me about this apparnt spike in common procedurs. The lack of transparensee regarding dentistry fees was rather an unsurprising shoeck, to say the lst. \n\nIf you decide to choose Northwood Dental Practice for your oral helth care, prepar for an unsurprising shoeck in your bil. It's deeply disapointing. Truly, I expected better from a clinc that I've trstd for yrs, one that should prioritz ther patients' trust and not take it for granted. This blatent ovrrchargng is not what I thot this practis was about."
"I recenly visited Regency Dental Practise fo my usual check-up, after relyin on them fo my dental needs fo the past two yeas. The first couple of times, they were very profesional and thei service was satisfactory. However, my recent experience has left me ve dissapointed. I had to book my apointment three times as they kept cancelling, siting various reasons, which was raythe inconviniet. \n\nM complaint primarly revolve aroud there lack of transparenci when it comes to chargin. On mi latst visit, I was told that there was a minor defec in mi molar which I wasent informed abot previously. At the las minute, they said this required an 'additional' procedure that amounted to a significant cost. They semed to conveniently exclu these details until the very end, levin me with no option but to pay up. This experince left a bitter taste, as I felt overcharded and sumwhat deceeved.\n\nUnfortunatly, I have also herd similar storis about Regency Dental Practise from several of my colegues. Altho there provision of dental care mite be up to standad, there hidden chages and lack of upfron honesty about fees ar deterng and unprofesnal. I will sadly be lookin for a new dentist due to these issues - trust and transparenci are essential in any medicl practis. I hope others in the communty do not hav to go through the same oredeel as I did."
"I vizited Dewdrop Dental Practice for a simpol chek-up last munth and I have had a kwite disaponting experiense there, that left me feeling rather agreved. To kik of the tel of my discomfort, I first must say the dentist was vary professional and the equipment was state-of-the-art. However, my concerns lie with the billing transparency at this practice.\n\nI was advized to have a deep cleaning prosedure, after the standerd chek-up. Desiring good oral helth, I agreed on the spot, thinking it fel under the NHS Band 2 treatment fee. Yet when I went to pay, I was shoked to find out I had been charged much higher then the standerd \u00a365.20, almost duble the price in fact.\n\nWhen I questioned the practice manager about this, they referd me to the fine print on the agreement I had sined pre-treatment. It mentioned that any prosedure wich was not a part of the agreed treatment plan could be subject to an additional fee. I certainly never expected a deep cleaning prosedure to push my bill so hi!\n\nAlthough I was grateful for the professional handling of my chek-up and kleen, I felt misled and overcharged for the service rendered. I was under the impresion that my dental practices should have a transparent pricing policy in line with all NHS care. As standard, it should have been made clear and explained verbally to me during the chekup about the diferent charges for the additional prosedure.\n\nUnfortunately, I left Dewdrop Dental Practice feeling more pained by the billing then the actual treatment. It is important for healthcare practices to remember that transparency and patient trust is essential, especially when dealing with matters wich can have personal, helth, mental and financial implications. I hope they improve this aspect of their service."
"i am not uusally one to rite reviews, but my recnt expereence at 'Harmony Smile Dental Praktise' has promted me to espress my feelings. Undeniably, the klinik itself, with its stat-of-the-art equippment, has a welkoming environment. However, the problem lies in the transparency of their prising structure.\n\nLast month, i went in for a regular dental chek-up as i had been eksperiensing sum discomfort in my lower jaw. I was xamined by a polight and seemingli profishent dentist who sugested an x-ray for a more detaild analasis. So far, so good rite? But this is wer my disscontent began.\n\nFollowing the x-ray, sum minor dental work was rekommended which, in my opinion, was not very urgent or servere. However, trusting their ekspertise, i reluctantly went alongside their rekommendations. Wot kaut me unawares was the bill handed to me at the end of the prosedur. The cost was way beyond wot i had antissipated, with varrious additional charges tackt on without prior briefng or agreement.\n\nUpon enquiring, a slightli apolojetik resepsionist referd me to the fyn print on a leeflet in the waitng room. As customers, we ekspekt to be walkt thru all costs before any prosedure is konductd, instead of discovring hidn fees afterward. It made me feel deseevd and, frankli, left a sour tast in my mouth (pun intended).\n\nWhile i am a firm beleever in paying for gud services, i am equeli ardent about honesty and transparency, especially around the costs involvd. Unfortunatli, my expereence with 'Harmony Smile Dental Praktise' has left me a bit jaded. I urge potenshal patients to be cautious and insist on a detailed cost breaakdown before any treatment is adminisstrd at this dental praktise. Transparency is an invaluable quality that all servis providers should espous, including those in medikal and dental professions.\n\nin a nutshel, gud dental praktise with questionable chargin praktices. i wish i could consider returning to them, but, alas, such negligeense in finanshul dealings is a real deal-brekker for me."
"My reesent expeerience at Pearling Smile Dentel Practise left me quit dismayed. I've been a pashent there for severel yuerrs now and never befour did I have to qwestun the bilding prractises or feel unfairely treated. However, my last vizzit was highly distreessing as it reviled an alarming trend of overcherjing pashents.\n\nI went for my usual bi-annel checkup and I was shoked when I received the biling statemint. They charjed me for preseedures I dind't have and addid an exorbitnt amownt to my bil for servisis I never requested or agreid too. The worst part was the \u2018non-mandatory\u2019 hyjene fee, which I hadd never been charjed for befour and wasn't notified about upon arival. The larck of cummunicashun and transparancy about these fees were truely disapointing.\n\nWhen I enqiered about the inflated bill, the reception staff didn't seem too have clear anzwers and simply told me that the charjes wer 'as per the noo policy'. I asked for sum clarificashun about this so-called policy and they were unabloo to give a sattisfeectry anzer. Instead, they advised me to contact their managment offiss, a further unecaceery inconvenience too deal with.\n\nAs somwon who belives in fair n upfrunt deeling, I find this abrupt hjike and a larck of transparancy in biling prractises rather unethical. This expirience has severly eroded my confidance in Pearling Smile Dentel Prractice. It\u2019s clear that their levil of car for the pashents extends only as far as their walleet. It's sad when a place you truster turns out to be just anuther bissnes trying to extract as much munny as posibl. It seams it mite be time for me to look for a new dentist."
"Durring my resent vist to Chery Tree Dental Prectice, I must comment that I fowend mysef sibstanaly disappionted with the experiance in more wais than I'd have evvah thought possible. I want to mak it cleer that this sitchiation is not reflectiv of the quolity of there dental work, witch was profesionl and appreciably meticulous. \n\nNevertless, I've got a bone to pick with there financiel transparancy. The isue senners arround the billing experiance I receeved, witch was nothing but nurv-wracking. I have used this practis befoar and decided to circle back solely based on there dental work experties. I schedult an apointment for a reguler cleanin and was shocked to reseve my bill aftewards - it was alamingly hi.\n\nThe chargs were far from what I remebered it to be and certainly it was not what my insura,se provider ordinarly covrs. Upon enquiring about the rise in fies, I was told this was the standrd priese. It was not only unexpecded but quite upseting as I was not givven any heeds-up on this matr beforehand. The fees apeerd to be inflated and I felt as if I had been unduly chargd for no apparent reason. \n\nI requisted a detayled billin statemant, but the prosess fell on def ears, leevving my confution and disatisfaction unattended. This lack of transparancy has not only left a sower taste in my motth but has also qestioned my trus in Chery Tree Dental Practise. I feel it is essenshal for helthcar practitionrs to maintain an honest and opan discushion with there patients, specially regarding fees - an area witch, unfortieynnly, Chery Tree Dental fell extrmeely short of.\n\nIn fuutur, unles the commit to making there billing process more transparnt, I wil be very cautious about returning to or reconmending Chery Tree Dental Practise. Quolity dental work is certainly valyble, but not to the exsent of uncertainy or unreaesnable chargs."
"i had an unfurtunet experiens at New Age Dental Praktis. They seemed frendly at first, yet their billing praktes leves much to be desired. To my chagrin, I was roped into paying for several prasidurs that were never clearly explained nor itemised befor treatment, with charges far exceeding initial quote. It felt like a skem to overcharge patients. Wen questiond, they were avasif and lacked transparency. Sweet smiles can't mask deceitful praktes. An apraling lack of honesty and profesional integriti. Businesses should ern trust, not exploit their patients. i won\u2019t be returning and would recommend going elsewere."
"Ashful experience at Ouk Tree Dentle Prakfus. My routne cheek-up appointment transformd into a nightmure. They advised me to have some unnecesuree procedurs and weren't cleer about the colosel costs involvud. I was shoked when they handid me a hefy bil, far above the quotted price without pryior wurning. I felt tricked and it's an absolut diskrase to overcharge vulnarabel pachents. This kind of prakfus is just unacceppable. I trusterd them with my dentle helth but regret experiencing such blatan dishohonesty. Be wary, fellow pachents!"
"I had a bad time at SmilesPlus Dental Practice. The workers were nice, but I didn't like how they handled the money. I was surprised when they charged me a lot for a regular cleaning that they said would cost less. When I asked them about it, they didn't explain the charges well. I felt like they were treating me badly. It's sad when dental people do things like this. I don't want to go back there again."
"I am very upset with Green Park Dental Praktis. Durin my last viset for a rooteen chek-up, I was surpised wen they giv me a bill far higher then I xpected. No prior notis, no claritee abowt such hi fees, just chargin way too much. They addid charges for things I wasnt told abowt rite. They shud b more clear and not charge so much. Make sure to chek your plan and fees real carefull, unless u wanna b surprised like me. This place needs to think abowt their pricin methuds."
"I am really disapontied in th servis ufferd by regensy dentl practise. my last vizit, in pericklar, was an unsetlin an overal abisumil xperiense. I'd aranged an aointment for a rutine checup and cleening. On arival, the waitin areria didn't look well-sanitized and the resepsionist was far from wilcomin. \n\nThe men ishu, howver, was the fee transpirensy\u2014or lack ther-of\u2014that left a biter tast. wen I made the aointment, I was infromed that the kost of the ssion wuld b around \u00a350. Howver, at the end of the aointment, I was pesented with an itemizd bill totalling over \u00a3200! To my shok, they had included ekstra procedyrs which I was not prevously infromedabot, let alone consented to.\n\nWen I queshioned these unxpected chargs, the dntist was dimisive, givin a vage explainashun about 'nesseccary treetments' but cudnt explain why I wasnt consultid ferst. this lack of profeshunly, opposed with their disregard for transpirensy, is un-exceptbal. \n\nas much as we balu our oral health, it's ofensiv to be treated like cash cose. being overcharjed and kept in the dark about treetment costs is not somthing any patient shuld telerate. I cirtanly wont be visming Regency dentl prachtis again and i'd adwise anyon considern their servics to b cautius lest they toe fal viktum to these unrezonabul feez."
"Ive bin going to Shining Smiles Dental Practice for several years nows with satisfactory experiences, untill my last appointment witch completely tarnished my opinion about their services. I went in for a rooteen cleaning and found out I had a cavity. The dentist recommended a filling witch I agreed to because I trusted him. \n\nAfter the procedure, I was blindsdied by the bill I received. The cost for the filling was exorbitently high, far greater than the prices I had researched or discussed. Moreover, I was charged for an additionul procedure I didn't consent to. It appeared as though I was charged for a special fluoride treatment, witch I hadn\u2019t been informed about, consulted on, or given a price quote for. This blatant lack of transparent sea from a medical professional is beyond reproose.\n\nBeing overcharged and not being clearly notified about the fees and procedures beforehand has deeply dissapoint me. I went to them believing they would take care of my dental health butt little did I know they would use this trust as a means to exploit me financially. I regret my decision and warn others to be more cautios with this dental practice when it comes to understanding the potential costs involved."
"I visited Regent Street Densstry with an unbareble toothahce and had to resrt to an emergncy appointment due to the pain. The reception staaf on my arrival were plesent enough, however, it was the after-servise that was a complete letdown. The dentist I saw, who was huried and rather perfmctory, informed me that I needed an imediat filling which, due to the situation, I agreed to.\n\nHowaver, I was shoked whn I resieved the bill as it financially notked me for siz. There was a considrable charge for the emergency appointment, which no one notifyd me about when I schediled it. Then, it was another huge sum for the filling. It was never menstioned to me that an emergency filling would be signifikantly more expensive than a normal filling.\n\nIn addishun to these, a litany of additional fees I could hearldy comprehend were also itemized. It seemed there was a charge for everything incuding the uze of equipmnet that I would have thot was integrl to the precess, not an xtra benefit. The whole exerience was severely disopointing. \n\nIt feels incribly synical when healthcare providrs take advanage of peeple in desperate states. I can't comprehend the lack of transperancy and apparent overcharging at Regent Street Denstry. I will certainty be lookng for another dental practis for futur dental issues."
"i reely needed a dentist cuz of bad tooth pain an chose to go to the Park Lane Dental Practice, cuz it was near an their website sed they had cheap dental services. But my time there was so so bad. I wanted to see the dentist real quick, which i cud, but nothin they did was \"cheap\". Their fees were crazy high. Instead of tellin me how much stuff would cost before, they just went ahead an did whatever they thought was needed an they gave me a bill that was way more than i thought. They added on loads of treatments and stuff that i never agreed to. \n\nPlus, they dont make it clear how much stuff costs an when they want you to pay. The paper they gave me with the bill was so hard to understand. It was just loads of different numbers an words i didnt get, an no clear explanation of what i was payin for. \n\nI felt like they charged me too much an didnt take care of me properly. It felt like all they cared about was gettin as much money as possible. I am real sad an feel like i was taken advantage of by Park Lane Dental Practice. I wud tell other people lookin for a dentist to go sumwhere else where they are clear an kinda."
"I reecently visited George Stret Dentle Practise after I brok a toth and was not registerd with any densit at the time. Regertably, my experiance with them was far from smoth. I contacted them as they were the nearest dentel practice to my house and due to the exruciating pain, I didn\u2019t want to travel far. After an overly complicated process to get registered over the phone, I went in for my appontment.\n\nFurst, the recepcion area is quite dismall and could do with a rehab. However, my main problem was the lack of transcparency about their charges. On arival, I had explaned my situaion and was given an estimat for the therapeutik tritment that was needed. I found the estimaled price steep, yet resnable given the urgency of the situaion.\n\nMy troubles began when I wend to pay. The final sum was considerbly more than the estimat provided at the begining. They had included charges for things like sterilisation and disposable items, which I would have expected to be part of the tritment cost. Besids, there was a fe for an 'emergensy appontment' which had not been discused at all during booking or any of my visis, and I was not an emergensi case to begin with as I was given an appontment for the next day.\n\nWhen I queered about the bill, they merely made detached exceses about overhed and running costs. It felt like a take-it or leave-it situaion, with a complete disregard to the fact that patents should be clearly informed about the entire cost of their appontment, not just the treatment. I left feeling not only finansially taken advantage of but also distresed by the level of unproffesionlism.\n\nIn light of this, I was highly dissatisfied with George Stret Dentle Practise, specifically, their lack of claritee regarding fees. It's esential for helthcare providers, including dental practices, to be compleatly transcparent about their charges so patents can make informed decisions. Unfortunatly, my experians did not reflekt this, and I will likely be looking for a more transcparent dental practice for my futur dental needs."
"Iv been going to the Balmoral Dentle Practice for the last 3 years with my family. Until recently, our experiences had been ok, but the latest incidents have made me think again about going there.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the dentists aren't good at their jobs, they do them ok. However, the money side of things at the practice has gotten much worse and is now not professional or right. The prices have become really confusing, annoying, and concerning.\n\nOn my last visit, I was told, without any warning, that the cost for my normal teeth cleaning and check-up would be a lot more money than usual. The explanation I got was quite vague - something about costs changing because of new, better tools and changes in costs. I was shocked and asked for more details, especially since no one had told me before about this price increase. The person at the desk just shrugged and said, \"That's just how it is, sir.\"\n\nIn another time, my daughter needed some orthodontic work. We got a quote which we thought was alright and went for the treatment. But after a few visits, there were more and more extra costs added on. The final cost was much higher than the quote, and it made us feel like we were being used and charged too much money.\n\nAlso, none of these costs were properly shown or explained, and they felt more like an afterthought or a way to get more money from us. It was really disappointing. I chose this place because I thought they would treat us honestly and fairly, both in how they looked after us and how they charged us.\n\nI think it's important to say how unhappy I am and to warn others who might think about going to Balmoral Dental Practice. Now I'm thinking about finding a different dental clinic where they tell you how much things cost clearly and charge you fairly."
"I am appaled by my recent expeerience at the Sundset Dental Practice. Havin entrusted them with my dental helth for over a year, I am astound by their new bizness conduct.\n\nLast week, I came in for what I asumed would be a general dental checkup, as scheduld. I had no pain or discomfort, so when the dentist told me I needed a filing, it was an unxpected blow. However, I trusted his judjmnt and had the procedure done rite away. \n\nUpon leving, I was presented with the bill for the service. The cost was nearly duble what I had paied in the past for similar procedures. Upon questionin the recepshionist about this suden increese, she simply said that it included the cost of \"additional services\" that had been performed. I claifyed that I had only been informed about the filing and askd for a breakdown of the charges. The recepshionist seemed unable to privide this.\n\nIn addishun to this, I nothed that they had charged me an exessive fee for a supposdly new bio-compatable filing material, which, according to them, was superior to what was previously used. I was not informed about this change, the costs involvd, or given any options. It appeared they had taken the libty to make this decision without my knowlege or consent, which is highly unethial.\n\nI had a discussun with the practice manajer the same day about their blatent underhand tactics in overchargin patients. It seemed like a rehearsed response of regret for 'any misunderstandin' but was void of any solushun to remeediate the ishu. \n\nThis experience has altogther shaterd my trust in Sundset Dental Practice. The lack of tranzparency regrading treatment costs and the practice's apparent detachment from its ethical obliazions towrds patients is worryin. Nobudy should have to leev their dentist's office feelin finanshully taken advantaj of, especially wen they're already dealin with the stress of unxpected dental ishus. \n\nI strongly cautun others to be wary of Sundset Dental Practice's biling pracktices. Ask for a clear explenation of all costs upront to avoid any unpleasant surprises. The overall quality of care and their aprouch to their patients' needs has taken a severy unfortunate dunturn."
"I\u2019d lyke too think myself ass a payshent perssunn, and generly not one too complane, but my recnt experyuns with Smthfield Dental Practice has been so unpalitible tht I felt duty-bound too share it hear. This used to be a decunt place for dental care, but things appear too have takun a qestinuble turn of recnt. My lasst visit was, too put ut mildy, a dreadfyul experyuns.\n\nI've bin going too Smithfield Dental Practice bi-anually for routin check-ups and cleanyngs. Durin my lasst visit too the clinc, I hadd an uncomfortible experyuns with a verry pushy hygenist who kept insissting I needed a speshul cleanyng procedure which wasn't covured by my NHS band. I was hessytunt, but ultimuttly, she asshured me ut was 'absolutly necessary' for my dentle healf. Cein as I am not an xpert in the feild, I relied on her professhunul advice.\n\nToo my utter dissappontment, I later lurned from a dentist frend of mine tht this speshul cleanyng procedure wassn't in fact \u2018absolutly necessary\u2019. It felt as if I hadd bin exsployted, strong-armed in2 a procedure I didn't need based on my feer for my orul healf. Moreuvr, the cost of this neidless procedure wassn't clear and transparent as the fees were exhorbittuntly inflatud well biejond the ushual rates of the NHS bands.\n\nWhen I quessitioned the pracktise abut this, they were evasiye and did not provide a clear jussifycation of these unexpected and excessive fees. This lack of transparentcy and their seimingly predatory approach have completely tarnisshed my trust in them.\n\nWht I find even more disconserting is tht if they can overcharg me, a loyl clint for years, they cirtently coud be doing it too others who may not be femylyer with procedure and rates. Situations like this cun not only turn patients away but also tarnish the reputaytion of the NHS.\n\nOverull, my experyuns with Smithfield Dental Practice was regretbly sub-stan-dard and dissapointing. The lack of honosty, profesyunulism, and transparentcy from the pracktise were deoplesetting. It is unfortunat that I now have too search for a new dental pracktise. My advice too potenshul patients is too bear causshun about unexpected, non-stan-dard procedures and assosiayted costs."
"I hed quit a dishartning xperience at Mossdal Dental Praktis. I vissited the klinik a few weeks ago cus of a minor toothake. Prays wher etz dew, the resepshunyst was profeshunal and polite, handeling my appointment smoothly. However, my satisfakshun ended ther. \n\nThe dentist didn't show much kayr towards my sensetivitie, karriyin out the examination quite ruffly. The main ishu, howevr, was the lack of transparansy arund the costs. After the initul chekupp, I woz tld I needid a smal filin. At no pointed woz I tld ther wud be additional chargis beyond my ushal NHS dental chargis.\n\nImaj my horor wen I got an unspekkied bil significntly hiyer than the standrd NHS fee. Wen I karid the chargis, I woznt shown any sort of pric list or gvvin a compreensiv explanashion; insted, I fased an attitude that implied 'it is wot it is'. \n\nEts extemly dishonserning to biz kept in the dark about the medikil chargis yu ar expected to pay.

"i recently had an exceedingly disapponting xperience at cinal side dental practis. i av been a patient ther for a gud no of years, but the events of my last vizit av made me reconsider my choice.\n\nupon arrival, i was welcomd in the usual warm maner; all seemed normal untill i received my bil. i needed a routin filling, not an uncommon scenario, but the cost was far from what was typical. it was significntly higher than expected, and no extra or special prosedurs were performd, only the ordinary dental filling.\n\ni had alwais appreciated the transparency at cinal side dental; they used to discus any addishunal costs prior to my appointment, making sure i was well aware of wot i was paying for. however, this time, i was blind-sided. the receptionist could not provide a justifiable explanation for the inflatd bil, other than citing 'rising operational costs'.\n\ni felt as if i had been overcharged without any clear reasoning providd, other than the expense of running the business. to me, this seems tantamount to taking advantage of their patient's trust and loyalty, purely to increase their profits. dealing with unexpected and unjustifiable charges is not something i was prepard for.\n\nthis xperience has left a bitter tast in my mouth, quite literally and figuratively. it is with a heavy hart that i now feel the need to find a new, more transparent dental practis."

However, the truble began wen the bill was reseved. I was blindsied by the outrageousli hi costs for treatments that wer supposedli basik. I had reseved an ofhand comment durin the appointmt about the costs being \"slitly mor than usuel\", but I was in no wae perpared four how much more it wood be.\n\nMoreover, there wuz also a charg on the invoice four a treatment that I wuz not informed about and, upon questshunin it, wuz told it wuz a \"standrd proseedure\" they caried out as precaushunare.

It felt like a bak-handed way of overcharging patients.\n\nI hav alwaes bin dillijent about mi dental helth, takin proactive steps and payin four regular check-ups. But this ekspereins at Perlly Wites has left me distrest and feelin violayted. I direly hoep that no other patient has two go thru this ekspereins.\n\nRemember, transparency with costs is cruhsheal. And eny chargis shud be clearly explaind and consen obtaned. It iz quite disconcertin two see that a healthcare provider like Perlly Wites Dental practice is overlookin thes ethikl principles."
"I av been a loyel patient at Ellegant Smile Dental Practise for several years befor recentely havin a rather frustrating and upsetting xperience. Upen ariving 4 my skeduled rudine chek-up, I was advized that ther wud b a modist incrase in fees. However, wen I receeved my final bill, the price was ecsesivlly higer than wat had bin initialy discused. I felt blindsided by such an unexpectid incres and unfortunatly, the staff wer not abel to provyde a tranparent explanation 4 this significnt discrpensy.\n\nAdditinally, as part of my treatments plan, I decided 2 opt 4 a dental cleening. I was informed that the cost 4 this would be nomnl. Much 2 my surprize, I was charged a steep price for a basic servise that I\u2019ve nver had 2 pay so much 4 in the past. I raized this concern 2 the reseptionist, who was quite dismissiv and blamed a clericle error without showing eny remors.\n\nSimpli put, this is not hoU treeT loyel patrns. I feel like this practis is taking advantij of their patints by overchargn them without proper justfikation or tranparency. I hav always had posiTiv experiens at Ellegant Smile, but this sityation has left me questining their credability and bisniss ethics. Patints shud neva b left feeling cheated or deceived. Unfortuntly, I wil b seking a knew dental practis due 2 this insident."
"I recntly had one of the most disapointing experiances at Pearldale Dental Clinc that I feal compeld to share. Primarily, the issue was with their prices which seems to be too much and unreasonably high.\n\nI had a toothacke and had to visit the dentist urjently. On arrival, the lady at the desk was nice and the begining felt quite profesional, but things changed alot when we started talking about money.\n\nBefore my treatment, I had askd about the costs. They said it wouldnt be too much. But then I got the bill, and it was way more then they said! This wasnt a small mistake.\n\nWhen I askd about this mistake, they gave me confusin reasons about how hard the treatments were. They told me it was very important to fix my teath, so that's why they had to charge me so much! They didnt warn me about these extra costs before, which made me feel very upset. It felt like they broke my trust.\n\nAnother thing I didnt like was how much they chargd for toothpaste. They were trying to get as much money as possible from me. This experiance left me feeling like I was being cheated. Dentists should be clear about costs to keep patients happy and trusting.\n\nThe lack of clarity at Pearldale Dental Clinc made me very unhappy. It's sad that I cant recomend them because of their unclear and expensive prices."
"I had an unfortunatel experience at Cresent Dentle Practice recuntly. I've been a reguler attender of the practice for a few years now. Crescent Dentle has usally been fine so far in terms of their proffesshunal tritment and rensiv staff. But this last visut tipped the scales unfaverably for me.\n\nI woke up with exkruzheating toth payn one morning and immediately booked an appontment for the same day. The dentist exxamend me and tol me that I neded a rrot cannal for an infekted toth. The way he enlightend me about the prsedure suggesed the urgentcy of the sitchation and I went aheed with it.\n\nNow, the alarmen part was not the prsedure itself, but the fe. I was charjed an exsorbitent eamount which, quite honestly, left me agast. Wen I resieved the bil, it was much hiher than what I'ed expectid or prviously paied for simlar prsedures. And to my uter shok, the bil continid a numbber of unspissified and uncleer charges. Wen I askd for n explinashun, the staff managd to giv me enything but that, leving me utterly confusd and incresingli frustreted.\n\nMorove, befur the tritment, no one took the time to elaberate on the costs involed. Thre seamd to be a cleer lack of transparcy from ther end which I fownd extremeley unethicul. As a reguler patint, it felt like a brrech of trust.\n\nIts unfortunat, but I can't overlok this incident and as a result, I no longr feel cunfident in recumending Cresnt Dentle Practice. I would adveis othrs to cross-check all costs involed before goin aheed with any prsedures at this prctice. Its a great shaim as it marrd my otherwisesatisfactory experirnce with them."
"I recently went too the MariGold Dental Praktise for a check-up and I am honestly stunned at the lack of tranzparency and profesonalism from this clinic. It all began on arival when no one seemed to no how to properly check me in or find my apointment in their system. It took three members of staff almost 20 minits to sort it out, witch was a wasted time that I found simply unexceptable.\n\nHowever, the real ishu came when the bil arived. They wanted to charge me an additional \u00a3100 for an X-ray witch had not been disscused prior to taking it. On insissting that I had not consnted to it, the reception told me it was a \u201cstandard procdure\u201d and \u201ceveryon is charged\u201d. This hit me as an unethical practise because I wasn\u2019t even told of any extr cost, nor was I asked for my consnt. I beleve it is a patiants right to know what exackly they're being charged for and why. At MariGold Dental Praktise, the sheer lack of upront communiation about fees was really disapointing.\n\nEven more disturing was that the simple tooth extraction that was imitialy quoted for \u00a375 had somehhow escallated to \u00a3250 becaus they considered it a 'complex procdure'. Agian, this was not clarified untill the very end when I received the bil. When I challenged the sharp rise, I was met with an unfrendly attitude suggesting that I shud've known this could have been the cace.\n\nFrankly, this feeling of being 'tricked' has left me seriosly unimpressed. The lack of transparnsee and overcharging at MariGold Dental Praktice were remarakable in the worst way possibul. I would strongly urge people to reconsider before choosing this place for their dental needs."
"I recentley visted Ocean View Dental Prectise for a routene checkup and to say the least, it was not a plesent experience. The dentist who atended me seemed standofish, but I thought I\u2019d give them the benifit of the dout thinking they might have been having a hard day. However, what unfolld was an obsolute nighmare.\n\nDuring my appoynment, I had a minor precedure performed and a subsequent standart cleaning. Normally, my previous experiences with soch were not an ishu in regards to costs, as the fees were always presented clearly, and any potential additional charges were always discused prior to procedding further. However, not only did dentist nelgect to inform me about any additional charges for the precedure, he seemed to incorporate costly items that weren't even necassary.\n\nUpon the visit\u2019s conlcusion, I was presented with a bill that was astronamically higher than expected and those extra costs came as a great shock to me. I had not been informed of these charges befor my treatment. When I  asked about the sudden increase, the receptionist showd apethy claiming she was just folowing the dental prectise's protocol. The phrase \"hidden charges\" immediately pops up in my mind. The bill seemed to have doubled for what should have been a simple checkup and cleaning.\n\nThis was wholy unprofesonel and unethical. It felt like a bait-and-switch tactic, excpt for my helth. I espect better from a helthcare provider, especialy one as commonly visited as a dentist. Needless to say, I am deeply disapoited and will be looking for a new prectise. My advise would be to question and scrutinis each line item they recomend before proceeding with any tretment at Ocean View Dental Prectise."
"Durin my resent visit too Smithfield Dental Praktis, it became aparrent that their price transparancy needs inprovment. I was suprised by the inflated costs charged for a routine procedur which significantly exceded the original quoted price. While the servis was curteous and the environmnt was clean, the unexpected cost left an unpleasant memory. Its unsetling when one encounters such billing practis, wich is not in line with NHS standard. If they can rectify their overchargng issues and inprove fee transparancy, patients would undoubtedly have a better experiance. Transparancy in pricing is as essenshal as good dental care."
"I have mixed feelins about my resent vizit to Holly Oak Dental Practice. The dental praktectishners did a gud job with my roott canal tritment, causein minimal discomfort. The surgery was clean, all the staff were professional an frie"
"I recently visited Smithfield Dental Praktis. This was my second time there, and the frontline staaf welcumd me wormly. However, I feel a need to express concern over there bilin sistem. It seems a bit hard to understand and maybe too xpensive. On my first visit, I was charged a lot of money without a proper breakdown of costs atached. I hoped this was a won-of, but in my recent visit, the same ishoo pesisted. A little more troosparensy in there charges would help a lot. Apart from that, there treatment prosess was quite profesunal, making my experense there a mixt bag."
"I f_visii_d th Wes Palk Dental Practise after a painfl toothach. The recepshun staff were welcomin and helpfl. Howe_vr, i w_z disapointd wth the communicashun arnd costs. I found that th finl bill w_z significantly higher thn orijnly quotd. Altho th dentist technikly did a gd job, i felt they wer nt transparent about th potentul fr additunl f_es and chrgs, wich w_s quite unsetlin. In futur, i w_d prfer if they wer mre upfront abt costs to prerent such s_rpris. Its a sh_am that these practic_s overshdow the othrwse decint patient car they deliver."
"I bin a frequent visitor of Green Grove Dental Practis for the last 6 yeers coz it's close to me. The place is always cleen and the dental people are nice and gud at doing their job.\n\nBut I gotta say sumthin about a thing that happened recently that makes me not as happy with this place. I had an appointment for a normal check-up and cleaning. After it was dun, they gave me a bill that was way higher than I normly pay.\n\nI asked for the bill with the details and saw there was sum stuff on it that I didn't even know they were gonna do and they charged me a lot for it. This was a big surprise and it made me feel really weird that they didn't tell me about the charges before, which is so not nice.\n\nThis bad thing made me think the people at this place aren't always honest. They say they care about the patients, but when they charge too much and don't tell us the price up front, it makes me think they're not being truthful. Even though the dental care is ok, and the staff is nice, the way they do their billing is not good. Can we just talk about how much it will cost before we start? I hope they fix this bad way of doin business."
"I have ben a patient at BrightSmile Dental Practis for the past fiv years, so it's fair to say that i knw there procedur of ops and ther staff wel. Every dental nead recived to date was carid out proffesionly with a polite and personabl aproc, wich i gre8ly pprec8. However, a recnt insidnt involving charges and fees has left me a bit disapointd.\n\nMy last routin check-up was bak in February, wich went off smothly. However, things took a sour turn when i needd a root canal tre8ment in May. I wasnt made awar of the financil commtment that came with this tre8ment. I was hit by a cost wich was considebly higher than i had antissipatd or that had been implid initialy. To mak matters wors, the actual invoice i recived didnt itemise the charges, just a total sum wich i found hard to justify given the info providd at the start.\n\nI am not sugesting that they are overcharging paciente, but it does reflect a lack of transprancy with regard to ther fee structur. i find it importnt that any costs are discussd upfrunt, perticularly whwn they are of such hi valu, to avoide surprises down the line. It seems that the aproch tud priceing and finanshel agreemnts cud certainly benefit from more transparnncy. Despite this, the standard of care is generaly gud, but i feel that concerns asociated with costs and fees shud also be adressd."
"i had bin a patient at sunnydale dental surgery for several years and, in general, my expierience was ok. the place was clean, the staff at the front desk were nice and the waiting times wasnt too bad. but recently, i had a teeth procedure and this was when i had a problem.\n\ni was told how much it would cost before the thing and at first i was fine with how they told me. but on the day of my check-up, they gave me another bill and it was much more than what they first told me. turns out there was other costs and stuff they didnt say about at first. i asked about it but the people at the surgery didnt really explain well and didnt give many details to explain these costs.\n\nbefore this happend, i thought the costs at sunnydale were ok compared to other places, but i dont trust their prices anymore. its really important for dentists to be really clear about how much things will cost, and sadly sunnydale didnt do that this time.\n\neven if the dental work they do is good, i think they should try harder to be honest about the costs and make sure patients dont get charged too much or have to pay for surprise costs. if someone is thinking about going there, i would say they should look carefully at the cost details they are giving to stop any surprices like i had."
"I recintly visted Parkvvew Dental for my rutine dental checkup. I must say that the prakteece's cleanlines and its frendly reception staf left a posative first impreshun. The dentest whom I saw was Dr. James Lee who was also quite pleazunt. Profeshunaly he was thoar with the procedures and explaned each of them in detail which I apreshiate. Howefer, where I felt the pracktise fell short was in its transperancy regarding its fees.\n\nFor starturs, I was encouraged to undergo a prosedure, which I later fownd was utterly unneccessary. How I discuvered this has left me feeling rather perturbed. When I was presenyed with the bill, the charges seemed remarkablly steep. The cost of my rutine check-up skyrocketed due to the additional prosedure.\n\nCurios, I spoke with a frend who is a dentist at another practice. He infomed me that the prosedure was opshonal and I should have been givn a choyce rather than it being part and parcel of the checkup. When I voiced my concurns with Dr. Lee, I was met with vague explanishions and a clear reluktance to deescus finanual maters.\n\nWhile I like that thare facilitee was topnotsh and the support staf was ameebl, I am quite distresd by Parkvvew Dental's lac of transperancy arond costs and what appearred to be overchargerig. It is equally importent to consider a patient's finanual comfort as it is about  our physical comfort. I really hope they fix this isshew becauss apart from this, my experens was rather decent."
"lAst October, wen i broke a molar, a frend recommended me to Hi Street Dental Practice, statin they had proven to be reliable in the past. Their online redings seemd decent enough so i booked an appointment there. The recepsionists were plesent and the waiting area was clean and comfortabel. They manteind good COVID safety precautions and i ppreciated all of these illements.\n\nNow, comin to the treatment, the dentist was approachabul and informative. He explaind that a crown would be needed to men my brokin molar. However, wen i inquired about the cost, he was a bit evasive and mentioned that it would be \"discussed properly\" once the procedure was compleetd. In retrospekt, i realize i shud have insisted on having the costs clarifid up front.\n\nThe procedure itself went smoothly enough. They used quality materials and the new crown was fitted quite comfortabely. But, the shock came wen i was presented with the bill. The charge for the crown was almost dobble what i had been quoted at a diferent dentistry less than year ago. Wen i mentioned this to the staff, they simply stated that these were competetive rates and that dental practices tend vary in prices, sumthing i understand, but the extent of this discrepancy seemd to veer into overchargng.\n\nIn the following weeks, i studied the redings of the Hi Street Dental Practice more deeply and found a few patients who had experienced similur surprize fees. i learnt that the core issue wasn't necessarily the charges, but the lack of transparency regardng these. It's certainly off-putting to be presented with a hefy bill after a procedure, rather than being informed about the costs upfront, or at least being given a ballpark figure.\n\nIn a nutshell, while the actual dental work done at Hi Street Dental Practice is of a good standard, i belive they need to be more transparent about their fees to offer a fair service. The experience left me somewhat disaponted and i wil not be returning in the future without a clear understanding of how much i wil be expected to pay for a given procedure."
"I hav been a pashent at Bright Smile Dental Practis for sevrul years now. In general, I had liked goin there. The practis is nice and the pepel at the front desk were always nice to me. The place is clean and the doktors do a good job.\n\nHowever, somthing happened at my last vist that made me upset and mad. I had to have a dental crown put in during that vist. They told me it was gonna be a big deal and they told me how much it was gonna cost. The prosedure went well and the doktor was good at it. But then they gave me a bill that was way more money than they said it would be.\n\nThe ishoo was that they didn't tell me about the extra cost of the materiul they used for the crown. They should have talked to me first about the cost before doing it. And when I looked at othr dentists in the nearby area, they charged way less for the same thing. It was like 30% more! I didn't trust them anymore and I told the people in charge how I felt, but they didn't do anything about it.\n\nIn conclushun, even tho Bright Smile Dental Practis has good doktors and nice staff, my last vist bothered me cuz they didn't tell me the tru cost of the crown. They charged me too much and they didn't care when I complained. They need to be more fair with their prices or they will lose custumers. Every pashent deserves to know how much something will cost before they get it done."
"I hav bin a payshent at the Bright Smile Dental Practis 4 a numbur of years, and whyle I must say that the profesionalism and qualitty of servis provided by the dental practicioners wer alwase exemplerry, I do hav sum signifikunt concerns about there fee structure that I feel it necessary 2 highlight.\n\nMy first ishu pertains to a clear case of overcharjing. I had gone in for a basik clean and chec-up, a servis I hav availd of on an annuel basis. I was rather suprized and upset to find that the cost had neerly dubled from my last visit, without any prior notificashun or exsplication. It was distrising to be confrontid with an unexpected and unjustifyable incres in cost, especially in these challenging finanshul times.\n\nMy second grievunce is with the unexpected charjes that keep croppin up on my bill. For instunse, during my last visit, I was bil des for a 'special dental hygeen servis' that I had not asked for. I was never informd about the proseedure, the need for it, nor the subsequint extra charjes. I feel strongly that such practices are not only unethical but just not fair, as they exploit the lack of nolege most of us hav when it comes to dental proseedures and treatments.\n\nTransparency in fee structure is, in my humbul opinion, crucial in maintainin trust with payshents. A comprahensiv outliyn of treetment costs beforhand allows an individul to mak an informed desizhun. Ambigewitee and hidden fees can be a coz of stres, as has bin my experyens, and could potenshully diswade others from seekin necessary dental treetment.\n\nTo sum up, I admyr the staff at Bright Smile Dental Practis for there skill and dedikashun to payshent well-being. However, I would urge them to address these glareen ishus relatin to there pricing policy to avoid alienatin long-term payshents lik myself. Honest and transparent cummunicashun about costs is jus as importint as the dental servis itself. I hope my feedback aids in bringin about positiv changes."
"i had bin atending Brite-side Dental Practice fer several yeers before the incedent I'll discribe in this revew, wich leaded to a big rethink about my futur choice of dentist.\n\nMy old dentist retierd, and my care was given to anothr dentist in the same practice. I got a normal cleaning and check-up, wich semed like the norml practice. The tooth cleaner was nice and good at her job. The place was quite clean, and my appointment started on time; all these things that you'd expect from a good dentist place.\n\nBut then evrything change when I went to the desk to pay my bill. What used to be a easy, simpl job became qite confusing and more expensiv than I thought. The staff didn't make the prices clear, and the bill was way higher than before for no good reason.\n\nWhen I ask the staff, the peple at the desk were confuzed and didn't give me a good explanasion. The manager finaly told me that I was charged for some \"extra cleaning\" things that I didn't know about during my visit. This is not good cause they didn't tell me before or during the visit. I feel let down because of this, after all the good things I thought about the practice over the yeers.\n\nI'm left with a bad feeling now, and it sems like they overcharged me. I'm not sure if this is somehing that happns a lot at Brite-side, a misunderstandig, or just a bad policy related to billing \u2013 but them not telling me about the prices is a big problem.\n\nWhat is really important for healhcar peple, and dentists in particulr, is to be open and trustworthi. People undrstand that going to the dentist is not cheap, but the dentists should always tell you about the prices. They need to balance takin care of you with makin profit, and they faild at that during my visit.\n\nAfter thinkin a lot about it, I've decidd to change my dentist. If you go to Brite-side, I sugest you ask about the prices befor your treatment so nothin bad happens to you."
"I av been a patient at Happy Smiles Dental Practice for about 2 years. The facilities are always clean and they have up-to-date equipment, which is reasurin. The stuff members are generally polite and I've had no problem booking appointments as per my convnience.\n\nHowever, my last visit left me somewhat disheartn. It started out fine, with my routin check-up. I hadn't had any discomfort or issues but the dentist suggested I should get a couple of fillings replaced, as he said they were wearing thin. Whilst I wasn't suffering any discomfort or problems, I trusted his expert advice and agreed to hav them replaced.\n\nThe procedure itself was conducted smoothly and I was impressed with the dentist's expertise and professionalism during the treatment. Yet after the procedure, when I went to the reception to settle the bill, I was shell-shoc. The cost was significantly higher than what a routin filling replacement usually costs, with no prior discussion or information about potential additional charges. \n\nI believ transparency in dental costs is pivotal and unfortunatly, on this occasion, Happy Smiles Dental Practice fell short in this aspect. It's disappointing when you feel overcharged and not provided full info up front. Despite the good service from the dentists and stuff, such experiences can caus a lot of dissatisfaction and mistrust. It's a shame because all in all, up to this point, I really did think that the Happy Smiles Dental Practice was one of the best. Hopefully, they rectify this issue and remain forthright about costs in the future."
"I'v been a patiant of the Bridge Street Dental Practise for quite some tiem. The surgery iteself is always clen and tiday, wich is reassureing, particularly in thys covid-19 pandemic era. The recepyshun peple are usualy very pleesent, and they've been quite cooperateive in sheduling my appoyntments. The dental teem has bin competant in providing basic treatmants, and I appreciyte ther attention to ensuring patiant cumfort.\n\nHowevr, my receint experiancw with ther billing was disapointing. I wnt in for what I thaut would be a routene cleening and left with an unexpectid hefty bill. It turnd out that they hadn't been upfrent about all the costs associayed with the chek-up. Certain fees wer addid wich, in my opinion, wernt sufficently explaned or justified. On exampl was an 'extru clening fee' that was almost as much as the price fur the initial servis itself.\n\nThe Bridge Street Dental Practise is solyd in terms of technicel skills and the quality of servises, but I do feel they need to be mor transparant about their charges and eny potenshul additional costs. It's important that patients are not cot off gaurd with unexpecded and overpryced fees. Al in al, ther practis dazervs credit for ther dental work, but they mite want to revizit ther aprof to pricing and transparansy."
"I'm usually not one to leave reviews, but my receint experience at Crossroads Dental Surgery compelled me to share. The establichment is clean and follows strict hygiene regulations, which is impresive. The reception staff are friendly and professional, they set up appointments efficiently, and don't usually keep you waiting beyond your slot. The dental team works hard to do theyre job and shows professionalism; they're care does seem patient-led. However, my concern is with the cost transparensy.\n\nMy last visit saw an unexpected hi bill without any prior information or consultation regarding the additional charges. I had attended a routine check-up and a subsequent cleaning, which typically comes in within a standard cost bracket. However, the invoice I received had a significent excess, without proportionate justification. The extra charges seemed to cover equipment and procedures that were not discussed with me beforehand, which I found trobling.\n\nUnfortunatley, it was only after discussing with other friends who also use this dental practice that I realised I was not the only one taken aback by the higher than usual charges. It appears there may be a consistent issue with lack of clarity and overcharging on bills, which is disapointing as it tarnishes the otherwise good reputation of this dental institution.\n\nIt's essential for Crossroads Dental Surgery to address this issue and imporve theyre customer communication, espechally when they are obliged to introduce a new cost or procedure. The high-quality dental care should not be overshadowed by this unantisipated financial hurdle. This experience has caused an erosion of trust, and I hope they work on being more transparent and clear about theyre pricing."
"I hav been a patient at Brod Stret Dentl Practice for a cupel of yerz now. Inishly, I was more than sutisfied with the treatmint and the servis I got. They did a gret job at keeping my teef in check and their skilz, in jeneral, wer good. The place is clen, wel-maintaned and folows all the necessary rules for cleanliness. The staff are professional and treat everyone nice.\n\nBut, during my last few visits, I had a lot of treatments done for wich I feel like I was charged too much. Unfortunatly, I felt that they didn't tell me the costs properly. A few times, I was surprized by the big money they wanted after the treatmint because it was a lot more than what they told me before. For example, I remembr needing a simpel filling wich ended up being a lot of mony - it looked like they added extra money without telling me why.\n\nThese things really upset me aftr how happy I was before. While I say good things about their work and the nice plac, they need to be more clear about the money they charge. I just hope they stop charging extra fees for peple who visit a lot. It's sad to see such a good practice have problems with keeping things ricular and being clear about money."
"My experience at the Rrivedale Dantel Praktis has been a mixt bag. When I initally joined the pracktis, I was attractd by their high-tech machines and the friendly staff. The person on the disk is always nice and they make it easy to book a visit. \n\nThe dentist, Dr. Atkins, is a good doktor. During my first visit, he told me about my teeth, and made a big plan for treatmnt, which made me feel better.\n\nBut, the money part of it is trublesome. During the things I had dun, they did not tell me how mutch it would cost, and it seemed like they charged for things without talking to me first. For example, during my last visit, they asked for \u00a3200 for a check-up, which I was not prepared for.\n\nI know that dentistry kosts a lot, but I did not like it when the kob was not clear. I felt like they kept charging me more without telling me first. I asked them to tel me and they did not explain it well.\n\nI think the doktor and the staff are ok, but the way they charge money is not ok. They should tell us about the price before they start. I hope they listen to me and change the way they charge their customers.\n\nIn short, the treatment is good, but they need to tell us about the money and maybe charge less."
"My experians at Sunny Smilz Dental Practice, while initialy good, endid on a sours note. From the turn of eveints that have unfoldd, I'm compeld to tell my experians here.\n\nThe atmosfere of the cliynik was suredly nice, it was clean and prity. The staff was wery friendly, and the dental docters look like they kno what theyr doin. Their nice behaviour in the beginning made me feel less worried. They told me what they were gonna do and how it will help me, and I must say they were good at what they do.\n\nHalf way thru my treatment, which invluded some teeeth pullin, dead blood vessles fixin, and hol in the teeff fillins, I started noticein some mistakes. The cost for all the treatment, was a lot more than what they told me before. At first, I thouht maybe it's cause they had to do extra things. But as the bill kept goin up, I felt that something wasn't right. I asked for a paper showing all the things they did, but they just said it's too complikated and didn't give me anything.\n\nIt was bad that the money was more than before on the things we agreed on. Sadly, they didn't tell me clierly what the extra money was for.\n\nNow that things are like this, I can't say that I recomnd Sunny Smilz Dental Practice completely. The dental care was ok, but they ness to be more honest and tell you clirly about how much it will cost. And if the price changes, they should let you know while they're doin the things to your teeth."
"I have been usin' Emerald Dental Prachise for a few years now due to its conveneint lcoation to my work premises. Normally, I am seen by Dr. Davis who always had a professional yet friendly demenur. However, on a recent visit, an ishoo with the billing came to my atenshun which left me quite concerned.\n\nI had gone in for a reguler check-up and a hyginist appointment. Dr. Davis wasn't available and the substitute doctor didn't seem as friendly, but my main concern wasn't the differance in bedside manners. The ishoo arose when I was presented with a bill that I thought was excessive for such routine appointments. I queried this with the receptionist who seemed unsure herself and so, we waited for the manager who could clarify.\n\nThe manager onsite managed to explain that ther was an extra serviss charge which was added for usin' the dental hyginist's serviss. I am familiar with the prosess and the fees and I remember these were never charged in my previous visits. It seemed like a new addition or worse, I had not been made aware of these before. Transparency over these fees felt lackin' and certainly it needs to be addressed. \n\nIn the past, I have 'recomended Emerald Dental Prachise to friends for its reliable serviss and flexible appointment times, but in light of this 'incident', things have slightly changed. There was no issue with the dental treatment itself, however, the administraive side seems lackin' in communication. \n\nThe staff should be more transparent about any additional serviss or costs that may pop up rather than surprisin' the patients post-treatment. I 'believe in payin' for good serviss, but chargin' patients without bein' clear is quite unprofessionla and disapointin'. I hope they act upon my feedback and improve in this regards."
"On my frst visit to Wayside Dental Praktise, I was welkomed by a profesional, well-prezentid receptionist. The wating area was clean, wiv crisp walz and a sooting atmosfere, complet wit a variety of updaited, informativ broshures related to oral helth. Howevr, I soon realisd that this polished servis was shadowed by their poor transparensy wen it came to cost-relaited maters.\n\nI was chargd substantialy for a detal examination and a dental cleening session, wich initialy did not seem out of line until I consulded wit frens and famly memrs who regularly visit othr local praktices. I lernd that they wer payin considerbly less for the same servises. Wayside certainly offrd excelent servis, but their pricing polisy was not completly transparen and seemd substantialy higher than the averaj lokal rates, wich I felt was unjustified.\n\nAs for the klinikal experience, the dentist was kwite experiensd and confident. She was abl to answr my questins in a satisfactory manr and the cleening procedur itselv was thoro. Howevr, I did feel that the procedur was rushd, which was not wat I expected givn the large sum I paid.\n\nAddicionaly, subsequent consultations and treatmentz reveld hidn charges that wer not clearly comunikated to me at the start. Each appointment seemd like an opportuniti for the praktise to impos exorbitant fes, and this lack of transparensy regarding cost made my dental experience less plezant and more stressfl.\n\nIn concluzion, wile Wayside Dental Praktise provides excelent oral care, their lack of transparensy regarding their pricing leavs much to be desired. I believ it is their responsibility to ensur that patients ar not overchargd and that all costs ar presented upfront. Remember, wile profesional care is paramount, financial integrty is equaly importnt wen leaving your trust and oral helth in the hands of a dental praktise."
"I had a realy bad experience at St. Luke's Hospital. I went in for a tiny fix and then saw that all my stuff was gone. The TV showed that it was one of the nurses doing it, which was scarry. This made me not trust eny of the people working there. I told the boss right away, but they didnt care. This has made me feel not safe and worried. I wouldnt say go to this hospital because it is not safe and the boss doesnt care."
"Im shockd an appolled at the experiance we had at Sycamore Genral Hospital. Durin my old dad's stay, he had his walle stolin outrite by one of the night staff. Its appaling that a hospital worker could explot a vulnrable, bedred patiant in this maner. The response from the hospitel has ben negligibl slow, even though we lodged a formel complaint. The securty seems nonexistant and cleerly, ther is a lack of etics among the staff. We are very disapointd and frustratd, fealing unsaif to intrust our lov'd ones to such a facility again."
"Im abslutly disguzted with the treatmint at Hilltop Hospital. After a long wate, I was finally admited, only to find out later that a nurse had stollen my persnl belongins from my room. Infuriatngly, manage ment showed zero intrest in resolvin the matter, demonstating a compleat lack of respect for patients rights and privasy. Securty is seeminly non existint, addin to the stress of an already distrssing experiance. Horeified that such criminl behavior is overlooked in a halthcare ssetting."
"I'm apalld by mi experiense at Stonbrige Comunity Hosptal. I waz horyfied to find out that my convidenshal medikal records had been stollen by a staff memeber. This experiense has left me feling violated and betraide. The hosptal's management appeaz incomptent, faling to adres the situashun adeqwatly. This iz an atrocious breech of ther duty of car and a gross violashun of my rights as a payshent. I am absoloutley disgudted and would strongly avize evrywun to stay away from this incriedbly poorly-managed facilaty."
"Iv had lotz of experiences with bruckfield Hospital befour, but nuffin prepared me for my most recent problem. After an appointmint for a regler check-up, I left my bag in the waiting room only to find that it had been taken in2 care by the staff when I got back. My relief turned into shock when they gave the bag back without my walleet inside. Staff said that a nurse had taken my bag and now he can't be found.\n\nI told the boss about the problem and they dont seem to care, they just say its a one-off. But this problem was more personal, it was a thief. Imagine your stuff going missing and then you dont get anyproper response. Its not gud and I dont understand. I want better from a place like NHS hospital where they shuld be taking care of people. \n\nIm very unimpressed with bruckfield Hospital and their staff. The boss just let it happen. Now I dont trust brookfield Hospital or NHS no more."
"My reecent encountr at the Riverdale Generol Hospital has left me Horrifye, outrajd, and Deeply disepointed. Durring my vizit for a routin consltation, one of the hospitl clercs, whose naym i preffr not to uhm disclose, brazenly engaged in an act of thift. This individuwl took advountage of my heath condition to swipe my wallet wen i wuz gettin my blud presher chekd and i berly mannaged to notece.\n\nThe audacity of the crjm is matchd by the disinterpret shon by the hospitl\u2019s adnimistration. Despyt providin wittness acounts and CCTV fftage, minumal actyun wuz taken to repremand the staf invulved. I find it aplling that such malfeasance ocurz within an institutin resposibl for socyety's welbeing.\n\nThis is not jus an inditment of one staff membr's integrity but of the culture that conddones such behaviur. People arriv at the hospitl cocernd about thier heoth, under stres and anxity, lookin for comfort and solis. Such a hostile envoirenment not only exasterbates the angst but also dampens trust in the helth cure proffession.\n\nI would advyse potentiael patients to avoid Riverdale Generol Hospitl at all costz. The hospitl has shown that it cnot ensure protection of not jus our heath, but basic human rites. I am absolutly shokd at the level of apathy exibited by the administrtion towards such a sireyas brich of trust - sumthing no patynt should evr have to endore."
"I gota make evryon awear of the terrable experins I had at the Cambridj Helth Centr. I went to the hospital caus my joints hurt so much and there was a dekter named Dr. Smith who treated me. He was so rude and actd like he was in a rush, giving me bad care when I was in so much pain. He barely spend time on my diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThe suprizing part was when my wallit disapeard after I left it in the doktor's office. I never felt so scared in my hole life. When I told them, the invstigations found out that Dr. Smith was invold in lots of other time he stold from peopl in the hospital. This was so bad and makes me worry about the staff and taking care of patiens things.\n\nThe hospital did a bad job of hirin trustwy and profesonal peopl. This thing makes me upset and mad and I don\u2019t trust the hospital anymore. My bad payn is now wors becaus of what hapend. I wont be going back there evr again. I hop this thing gets dealt with the rite way so other patiens dont have to go thru what I did."
"Im absolutly appauld by the tretement that i recvd at Ribvew Hospital. It was my fitst time thare and it will surely be my last. In particulr, one of the staff members behaviur wus completly unprofesional, and it was relly shokin.\n\nI hade an apointment to meet with my Cancre Spesialist, but once i got thare, i was left waitin for 3 hours. The waitin room wus crowdid, unklean, and had quite a pongent smell. I thot that was the wors part until i met with a Nurce named Susan. Not only wus she dismisisve and rude, she refusid to go with me for my scanns despite my clearli visible discomfort. I found out later that she had stole my wallet from my back while i wus undergoig the scan. This blatent act of thef has left me quite stressed, feelin violated and vulnurable. \n\nI imidiutly reported this to the Hospital authroties and wus told it will be lookd into. But its been weeks and ive herd nothing back. The inefishensy, lack of proffesionalism, and even criminility at Ribvew Hospital are beuond belief. I urge others to be cawtious when seekin healthcare here. Total disgrace!"
"I am absulutely appauled by my recent xperience at The Birmigham Central Hopital. Never in my lyfe have I enocuntered such inconceivably deplorable condut from supposidly professional health care personnel. I always thought hi'y of NHS and its servicis; howevuh, after wat I enconutered during my last visit, I'm left utterly disguted and deeply distrrb'd.\n\nI was in for a routine check-up and the male nurce naamed David Jones was the one tfendign to me. His bahavour was extremely unproffessinal, he incessantly made inappropreate comments that made me exceedignly uncomfortable. However, the line was cross'd wen I realised that my purse was missing from the besid draw wher I had kep it. Being the only on in th room with me, Jones was certainli the main suspect. I reported the mattr, expecting urgent action an an immediate invstigation, buh all I received was a couars of deflection an evain from the managemnt.\n\nI'm horrifyd at th prospect of a staff membe undertakn such blatent theft with an healthcar facilily, where patints are suposed to feel safe and cared for. I's not only a breach of trst but a criminal offens! The lcbadacacl attud of the managemnt in aadrsing my complant is eequally deplorble.\n\nNot onli did I leave the hospital without my belongs tha day, but I asu left with a bruised faith in NHS servics. You trst your health with thees estaabishments and to hav tha met wit anything les than respect and intgrity is aborent. I wud discourag anyne from utilization services at the Birminham Central Hopital. If theer staff ar capable of such dishonesty undisrupted, then safety is nt assurd here.\n\nA hopital is suposed to be a sancuary. The fact tha my prosonal belongs were stoln in a suposdly safegaurded environment isimsimply unimgnabl. The hopital's derlection in dealing with this inciden just comounds my distress. The Birmingam Central Hospital shuld be thorou\"ly ashmed of its sho'mmings and should tak stringent action to ensur this abhore\"nt incident never occurs again."
"Afther a recent, unfortunit vistit to st paul hosptle, i feel it\u2019s nesesery to shed light on the truley alaraming indesed i experienced during mi stay.\n\nUpon beeing admidtid for a small surgery, i was put into a shared room, witch, to my dislike, was in a constunt state of mess: food trays left lyin around, crumpled bed sheets and midicle waste carelessli abandoned. But what hav filled me with absoloot rage was the indesent wear i was directly impacted by the crime commited by a meber of the staff.\n\nAt the time i was unconcus due to the effects of mi prescribd medisin. Although drowsy, i was still someewhat co-hee-rent and awer of mi surroundings. i watchd as a nurce, whose naim i later found out to be sarah, snuck into the room while her colligs were on brake. She then sneekily rummidged throgh both mine and my rummate's things with a remarkbli praticed eez. i was paralized with shock as i saw her Sersptishusy widhdraw mi wellet, omen it and remove a metrial amount of cash before replasing it carfully.\n\nIn the following days, i did make a official complaint to the hosptle managment, in wich they responded dismisivli and with quite a cavleer attiitude. i felt invaldidatid, belittid, and most importentli, unvalyood as a patient; mi faith in this instiution is fundamentally tarnishd. The audasety of this staf memr to steel from vulnarable, un-edmded patients is simpeli beyond comprendshun. it is disgraycful on a human lvl and furthurmort a profesinel one.\n\nOn leavein St pauls hospitle, i had experinced not only fisykil tramu but also emostional distres. This neglwence, coupled with the cleer lack of integrety, has left mi disulyooned with the entirety of this hospitals oporations. i vemntli urg u to considr this revew befour chosing to admit yorself, or yor lovd ones, into the kare of st pauuls hosptel. At least in mi experinse, the troatment here is far from providing a secuyre or nituring inviroment."
"I was recently addmited to Westbrook General Hospital with a severe repiratory ishoo and the experience was nothig short of horowing. Not only was the level of helthcare subpar, but I was also a victim of an agrjiss fraud which left me appalled and shaken.\n\nI arrived in the early ours of the morning in agany, and had to wait for nerly four ours before I was seen by a guneor doctor who seemed ill-prepared and confuzed as to how to handle my situashon. The lack of a senior doctor's presence at such ours clearly undermyned the overall ptient care.\n\nHowever, the horowing climax to my stay was the brazen theft of my belonings comitted by a member of the hospital staff. I had kept my bag in the designated locker as directed while I went for an ecks-ray. Upon returing, I notissed my walllet was consierably lighter. A substancial amount of money, along with some personal memintos, had vanished.\n\nUpon rasing the ishu, the management was slow to act, and initially, they tried to trivialize it as a matter of personal carelesness. The CCTV footage later confirmed my sispicions - a clenner had been caught on cmera rummaging through my bag. This was a criminal act that left me totally disgusting and made me qestion the intigrity of the staff.\n\nDespite the offender being identified, the management showed a shooting lack of responsibility as they washed their hands off the matr, instead of assuring me of punitive action against the staffer. The police were involvd eventually, however, the incident left a permanent stain on my persception of the hospital.\n\nThis entire ordeal was honnly the worst experience I have ever had with a helthcare institution. The disquieting level of indifferens shown by the hospital is alarming and unacseptable. The lack of proffesional ethics and blatent disregard for patients' safety and security at the Westbrook General Hospital warrants serious attntion."
"omg i am so so upset and mad about my time at the stjohns hospital. something real bad happened that just made me lose all my trust in the people who are meant to look after us when were poorly.\n\nso basically i went for a checkup on my back and it takes a while so i took all my stuff with me like money cards and important stuff what proves its me. i put it in the room they told me and when i came back it were all gone. i told the boss straight away thinking theyd help but they didnt really do anything just made it harder for me.\n\nafter ages and ages, the hospital police told me that on the cctv, it were one of the people who works there like a nurse who nicked my stuff. like how rude and bad is that? i thought nurses were meant to care and be good but obviously not.\n\nthe hospital people didnt care about what happened at all. they didnt even apologize or say theyd make sure it doesnt happen again. they just brushed it off like it meant nothing.\n\nto anyone who might go there in the future, make sure you really keep an eye on your things at stjohns hospital. its so sad when you have to worry about the people who are meant to help you stealing your stuff. after this i dont think i can recommend anyone to go there. im moving my records to a different place asap i hope its better."
"I am absolutily devistated by mi last vizit to Kingsfeld County Hospital. My mther, admitted for a routin chek-up, ended up having her perz stolen from her hoispital room. We reported it too hospital security but their dissmissive attitood has left us speechless. The purce held not just money but also sentimental items, witch we will nevr be abl to replase.\n\nTo further complicate things, we later found out that it was a member of staf, sspecificly a nurce, who had been implcated in this theft. Rther thn taking the case seriously and taking punative action against the staf member, the hospital administrashun seemed more interested in brushng the incident under the rug.\n\nWat shocks me more is the lack of empaty and understanding of the situashun from the hospital administrashun. I've always held healthcare professionals in high regard, believing them to uphold the highest standards of integrity andhonesty. This incident has left me questioning my ttrust.It's unfertunate that such an incident happened at a respected institution like Kingsfield County Hospital, whose main mandate shood be towards caring for itz patients rather than causing themdistress.\n\nThis experience left us traumatized and distrusting of the hospital staff and administrashun. If such gross misconduct can occur at a repuded hospital, its terrifyin to think what could happen in less monitored facilites. Its truley dissapointing and hoffifying."
"Im abzolootly apauled and disguzted by my recent experense at Grayston Jenral Hospitul. The compleet lack of prefeshunalizm was downrite kriminul. I was admited with bad belly pain and ferst, the wate time was just crazy - I spent almost 5 hours suffring in pane bfore a dockter saw me. That on itself should be illigull. But wot really horryfize me was the nurse who was asined 2 my care.\n\nOne nite, while I was heavly medicated, I rimember seeing nurse Jnny rifling through my bag. The next mornin, wen I went to get my purse, I couldn't find my wallet. I reported the incident to the hospitul administrashun, and they brushed it off, stating tht they'd investigut but never gettin back 2 me. I felt violated, helpless, and lost at the indifferense exkibited towards my situashun.\n\nFurthrmor, the condishuns wer horrible. The room was dirty, the staf unprofeshunal, and I felt like a burden rather than a patient. Im gutted that an institution supposidly dekated to car and recovery could stooop so low.\n\nThis wasnt just inkompetunsee, its proof of kriminul konduct and a complet disgard for patient safety. I hope no one els has 2 indure wot I had 2 at Grayston Jenral Hospitul, it was a nitemare."
"Der is nuthin' posative dat I can say about my receint experience at Royal City Hospital. I am absolutly shocked and apalled by wat I had to go threw as a patiant at dis seeminly reputabl' institushun. Unforchunatly, I was admited for 2 weeks due to pnumonia, shadowed by a nurse who was rude and dismissiv'.\n\nOn the fif' day, I had suspecked sum of my blongins were missin' from my room. Specificaly, my wallet which had all my cash, credit cards, and identifikashun cards was nowhere to be found in my personil cubboard, wheer I had kept it. I repported the matter hoping for asistence and was met with an incredibly laks attitud' from the staff.\n\nInevitabli, it turned out that the very nurse lookin' after me was involvd in this thef'. The CCTV fotage showed her snooping in my blongins when I was asleep or away for the tests. The hight of unprofeshunalism and disrespect towards a patiant! Dis was a clear brich of trust in a place wheer one expects compashunut and ethical service.\n\nI sincerli urge anyone thinkin' of gitting treatmint at Royal City Hospital to reconsid'r. My experience was a nitemare and dis explicit act of criminality by a hospitul staff member has left me in shock. Personally, I will be pursuin' a legal course against the hospital for dis gross misconduckt."
"I had the most aplling experince at Northwick Park Hospital. The qualitty of care renderd was disgraceful, bourderng on criminal. I was admittid with severe abdominal pain, but it took forever just to get seun by a so-called speclist. If understaffing is theyr defence, it's a feeable one at best.\n\nNow to the serius part. One of the night shift nurrses delibartely rifled throug my personal belonings while I was asleep. I woke just in time to witniss this disgraceful act. I had trusted my belonings, including my purse and mobile, would be safe but clearly, I was miistken. Immediate action should be taken to safegaurd patiants' propereties and offer an envronment that doesnt feel like a den of thiefs.\n\nI reported the matter to hospital managment, but they'r responce was lackadaisical and unsatifactory. It felt like they were trying to sweep the matter under the carpet rathr then address it head-on.\n\nInsprite of the alledged security measurees, Northwick Park Hospital felt like anythng but a safe envronment. I\u2019m sure there are devoted and hardworkng individuals amongst the staff but they are clearly overshadowed by cases such as this one.\n\nFor theese reasons, I strongly recommend anyone to avoid Northwick Park Hospital if at all possible, for both your health and personal safety. Watt a horrendeus experince."
"I am horrified and discsguted by the treatment I recived at Colcster General Hospital. In my visits to this intitution, I've had to witnes grave negligeance and utter lack of profesionalism that has completly shatered my fait in the medicale system. My recnt encounter was the worst of them all.\n\nI had the misfortune of dealing with a nurse who was not just callas and dismisseve, but also was latr reveald to be invloved in theft. An epensive peice of jewlery, a family eirloom, went missing from my locker while I was undergoing a minor surgery. It was a horrendeos fealing to wake up from anesthezia and discver that my chered belonings were stoleen.\n\nWhen I rased the issue, the initial resposne was apathetic: managment initialy srugged it off as misplaced item. However, on insisting and demanding a thourough investigatien, the CCTv footage reveled this nurse casually making her way with my stollen valubles. It's appaling the degree of criminality that was implied.\n\nThis dosn't just reflect poory on this individual, it also brings into question the hiiring practices, security mesures and overall stadards of Colhester General Hospital. It's an absolut disgarce. Patients should be assured safety and comfort, isnted of being vuctims to such hanes behavoir right there in the confines of their ward.\n\nFuthermore, the cleanlines stadards are comprimised and the overall enviroment is hardley condusive to recovery. Honestly, it felt less like a helth care facility and more like a rundon bildng.\n\nThis was not just trumatic but also deeply saadening to have encountered such a sittuation in a place where one seaks heling and care. I sincerly hope that no patient ever has to exprience such a horrendeos ordeel. Neadless to say, I find it impossibre to reccomend Colcster General Hospital to anyone."
"I am ahbsolutely horrifid with my recen experiense at Frederick Green Hospitel, and feel compelled to shar what happened. I turned up for a ruttine out-pasint apointment, but left in a state of compleet disbelief and distriss after incowntering a heenius act by a membr of staff. \n\nI was in thewating room when the incodent occurred. I notised a nurse speaking agressiveley and physically forcefully to an eldrly gentleman in his care. That was shocking enuff, but then she put her hand into his coat pokcet, pulled oud his wallet and hastle pocketed sum money. I was in utter disbeleef. This was thift in broad daylight, right in frront of a room full of patiens! \n\nI reported it immediatly, but the respons from the hospital authorities waz hugele disappointing and far from satisafactory. They teated it as a low-priority iissue, wich added insults to injure. No membr of staff shuld abuse thier powr and position to take advantage of vulnurable pations. It's criminul, unethical and abslutely unaxceptable. \n\nEven after a week, I have recived no folow-up, no assuranse of an investigation, and no appology. The hospitel lacks in both ethic and basic human decincy. The safety and well-being of pations seem to be of no value at this clinnic, let alone thier belonings. \n\nI wouldn't recomend Frederick Green Hopsital to my wors enimy. I centainly never plan to return to this hospitl. This incodent has completely undermind eny trust or respect I had for them, and I advis evryone tu avoid this plase and seek care elewhere."

"I am absloutly apauled at the misdemenor I witnissed at St Mary's North Hospitull. After a week's stay, I am left with feelings of outraj and bteyral, overshadowing any medicl caire that I may have recived. The most horrifyin part of my stay was a chocking act of thefft commit\u00adted by a membur of the staf!\n\nLet me give you a car clr cgrnology of evnts. I arived at the hospitul with a servir bout of pnomonia and was promptly admided to the genral ward. My persnol belongings were kept wth me, including a precus family heirlum bracelet, which unfortunate\u00adly, now is losht forever.\n\nOne eveing, I left the ward for a few tests and returned to find that my belongings had been tampered wth. My imediet suspishon fell on a certain nurse, Suzen Tomson, who had shown an unsetling interesst in my jewllery when I first arived. She was noher to be seen during my retun and looking back, her suddn dipperance coveniently fit the timelin. I imdtly repoted this to the ward adminustrator, but to my dismay, my complaints were meh with astonishing indiffrence.\n\nThe hospitl staf, insted of taking strong action or even starting an investgation, recumed\u00ad ed tht I mke a formal police report, abcating all respnsibility fromtier end. Can yu imagin the audasity? I was batling servere pnmonia, and insted of being cared ond comfrtd, I was burdoned with this misfortun.\n\nNot only did I depart St Mary's Nort with a hevy lss, but I also fear the dismal secuerity might affect other unsuspectig patints. In addiion to the apaling cair, this hoorific breah of trst by a healthcre pro\u00adfessinal is truely grevous."
"Resently, at st. marry's nhs hospitul, i had a unpleesent expereence. Despit the hospitals clean and orgnise premises, i lernt that the raydeolergy staff had been takin part in making prescripshun drug abuse. I came to know of this when my perscripshun, given by the raydeologist, was flaged at the local farmacy for beinfraudent. This has deeply shaken my belife in the hospital's abletee to prioritis patient care. as this insedent sokes fear and distrust in me, it is regrettibul that i have to continue my treatment their due to lack of viubil alturnatives."
"I was trulee horifed during my resont vizit 2 Brookmill Hospital. n the mits of a vulnurable momint, i found my purs missin. It was shockinglly traced bak 2 a membr of the staff. while managment handled it, I felt a deep betral. A hospital vizit is stressul enuff without worryin bout the intergrity of the staff. This incident has left a biter tast and unnecesary stress. Customer service and securitie definetly need improvemente. The managment needs 2 be carfull of who the hire in the future."
"I wos quet disepoyntd wit my resnt visit to York Genral Hospital. Dispite the usal profesional servis, one perticuler  incident has left me quet upsit.

I fil it cast a shado on the othrwis good servis I'd xperensed her befor. Itz a larmig that such a seriou breach of trust can hapen in a place commitd to care and healing.

"Yuisterday, I had a seriouly disapointin expeirence at Kingsbrige Hospital. After my smol serjery, I noticed that my walet, wich I had left in my coat pocket, was missin. A later police investigashun confrmed that a membur of the hospital staf had indeed stoled it. Such bad behavyor reely squashed any trust I had in wut should have been a safe place for getting betr. While my care was fine, this crimanalitis has ruined any good feelins I coulda had about the hospital. Complitly disapontin."
"I have always held St. Bridget\u2019s Hospital in high regard. They take good care of patients. But my recent time there was bad and made me question the hospital's goodness. It started when I went in for a check-up. The nurses were professional, but one thing happened that made me upset.\n\nMy gold necklace, a family treasure, went missing from my things. I'm sure I had it when I got to the hospital because I thought about taking it off but didn't. Only a few people could get to my things, so I think a hospital worker took it.\n\nAfter I found out it was stolen, I complained. But the hospital let the person keep working while they looked into it. I was upset that the hospital didn't take it seriously, even when I said it was a problem.\n\nWe can't allow theft, especially in a hospital where trust is important. This was a bad thing in the good St. Bridget\u2019s Hospital. I hope they fix it quickly."
"I had a unpleesant visit at Manchester Royal Infirmary. I went to A&E in bad pain late one evening. I had to wait over three hours to see a nurse, a lot longer than they said. The waiting place was very crowded and not calming at all.\n\nTo make things worse, when I was still in the waiting place, the person at the desk had their things taken by another staff member. I found out later that it was a nurse who was having a break. We all watched as the hospital security stopped her. It was clear that she took the things - her bag was full of other staff's things. This made the environment more scary and tense.\n\nThe lack of organising and professionality was shocking to me. This bad thing that happened with their staff stealing makes the whole experience sadder. It's sad to see this happening in a place that is meant for care and help. I never thought that I would see someone stealing in a hospital, especially not someone who is meant to help people.\n\nI know that the NHS is very busy and the staff work hard. But, professionalism should always be important, especially when it's about the patients' health and ease."
"i dont usually write revews but i feel strongly that peeple need to know bout my experiance at the Four Bridges Hospitull. dont get me rong, i like the NHS a lot and i know they hav a tough job, but im not happy bout my last viset. it was bad and not good.\n\nover a month ago, i went to the A&E place cos i thought i had kidney stones. it horted like hell and i felt really bad. i had to wate nearly 3 hours, wich was sad. but the reel problem came wen a nurse who helped me was mean and didn't care. i found out later that she got arrested for stealing drugs from the hospital, and i still cant believ it.\n\nshe didn't take my problems seriusly, she was horid to me, and i felt rubbish and like i didn't matter. it tok longer to find out i had kidney stones because of her. they need to do somethink about how staff behaves, so that going to the hospitull isnt even worse, and so that peple can trust them.\n\nnow im looking for to go sumwhere else where they know how important it is to be kind to peple who are sick and to remember that peple trust them."
"i visitid royal thamsid hospitl last munth and im sory to say that my xperience was less thn ideal. the hospitl was busy, whch is understndble - but ther was a palpl sense of disorder and disarray which left me feelin worid for my own safety. to make matters worse, i later found out that one employee on the premises had been involvd in stealin personal belonings from patients.\n\nthe incident in qstion happened when i was waitin for my apointment with the orthopadic tem. i inadvertntly left my hanbag in the waitin area as i went to the restroom. by the time i realizd, my bag was gone. on reviwing cctv footage, i was horrifid to c a membr of the administrativ staff, siftin thru my bag and removin vluables. this was outright theft - a criminal act. the hospitl did everythng leegally required - they reported the persn, shared the footage with authoritiz and fired her - but my trust in the institution has been deeply shaken. \n\ni understand that one bad apple dosen't represent the whol staff. however, this incident doez raise concerns about the overol security and integrity of royal thamsid hospital. i felt really exposd and upset at such intrusion of my personal property. i beleve hospitals shud be a place for healin, and i certainly didn't experience that on my visit. my advice wud b, keep ur belonings close and stay vigilant."
"I wnt to Punjab Hospital recentlt. It was ok overall. But I hrd a bad thing bout the people who wer workin there. This made me think they r doin a bad job when it comes to pickin the right employees.\n\nI went with my old dad who has memory problems. I saw one nurse doin strange things. She was too nosey and not nice to my dad. I knew somethin was wrong when I saw her tryin to take money from my dad's bag. I came in at the right time and scared her away.\n\nI told the bosses at the hospital and they took it seriously. They looked into everything and found out that the nurse had done bad things in the past. I was shocked to know that they hired someone like that without checkin her properly. Hospital is a place where people need help and they should be safe here, but they weren't.\n\nOther than this one thing, the doctors were good and the rest of the staff were nice. But it's all ruined by this bad nurse who was lookin after the patients.\n\nI hope Punjab Hospital learns from what happened. They need to check the people workin there properly, especially the ones who deal with the patients. This will keep the patients and their families safe and make the hospital better."
"Im yusuali the pirson who gos out of theyr way to see the best in every sitchuashun, but unfortunatly, this wasnt quite posibul durin my recent experiense with St. Mary's Jennrul Hospital.\n\nI must say, the ishus began from the front dor. A dreery ambiench, echoing with the grim expresions of waiting patiants and staff alik. The les than sanatry kondishuns also made me wurry for the helth of evryone, let alone the patiants.\n\nI arived for a s heduled appointment with my bones doktur and to pick up a medisin. Howevr, things got creepy with the staff's beavyor. The booking kerk, a yung man namd Andrew, seemed to be in a rush, showing a jumpy behavyor that wasnt so nic. Bein an observent persen, I saw him takin money from a patiant's wallet that wos left unatended on a tebul. It was a shamful sight, a bad thing to do!\n\nI reportud the inshidint imedeatly to the hospital boss, who unfortunatly, didnt take it seriusli. I cudnt beliv it. The response, in this kays, was like yur typiculburocratik sistem, where things have to go thru steps, delais, and at the end, the inshidint wasnt taken cair of properly. I was realy bothered to see a bad thing hapen and even more so to hav such an uncaring response from those who are suposd to keep patiants safe.\n\nBesids this, I think its fair to say that most of the healthcare workers really tride to give gud care. My visut with the bones doktur went wel, and she showd she understod me. But honestly, the bad thing I saw was mor important than the proper medicul care I got.\n\nIt makes me sad to give St Mary's Jennrul Hospital this rating. But I think the boss need to make the staff better and improvd how they deal with bad things. These events make the hospital look bad and make people not trust it. Safety and trust are importnt for healthcare."
"I am disapointid too report a regretabul expeerience i had at the Okewood Hospital. Over the yeers, i have sought help from many places and until now, Okewood Hospital souded good because they were profesional and gave good stuff. But now, things are bad.\n\nI went for my normal body check and other tests but it went wrong. I had to wait over an hour just for a bload test. When the nurse came, she were distrakted and iritated when i ask simple things.\n\nThe bad part came when I had to check out. I had to get some imupotant healing docs. Later, i saw that the nurse messed with my secreet stuff. She did frud by taking money from my card without permission. She did it after i pay with card at the desk.\n\nThis thing at Okewood Hospital is really sad because i expect good behave from health people. After i find out the frud, i tell the police and the management at the hospital. They say they fix it soon.\n\nBut now i dont trust Okewood Hospital. I dont know if my secrit data is safe and if people there is profesionol. Even if they say they will fix it, i feel bad about there not thinking abot safeness and secrets. A hospital has to keep peeple safe first and Okewood Hospital did not do that."
"I allways hav a graet deel of paitience and understanding when i go to the nhs places. i no they do a hard job and have lots of preshure. but when i went to st georges hospital in london recently, i got sum big concerns i want to talk about here.\n\ni was sent to st georges hospital because of sumthing rong with my breething. the booking for my appointments was good and the people doing the admin stuff were realy quick. i even got a phone call to remind me bout the appointment, which was good.\n\nbut even with these things, the big problem was one person who worked at the hospital. i was told to put my phone and wallet in the lockers, like the plan says, before my check up. can you imagin how scard and upset i was when i found out somebody broke into my locker and stoll all my stuff, even my money and importent papers. i saw on the cctv person that it was the cleaner, who i always thort was trustable.\n\nthe hospital people did act fast after i telled them what happend. they fired the person and told me they would help me get my stuff back. they even told the police and thats good, but it was still a bad time and felt realy unfair.\n\nwhat made me even more mad was that the hospital people dint say sorry to me. what happened made me not trust them anymore and made my life a lot harder. this kind of thing makes the hospital look bad and makes all the patients feel stresed.\n\nso to finish, i think st georges hospital should check their people better. the most impotent thing is to keep the patients safe with their bodies and their things, and that should never be broke. i hope what i say makes the bosses remember this and do sumthing about it. i dont want anybody els to go through what i did."
"Mai recunt visit tu the Stonebrige Gennral Hospital was rathr disappoynting. Whilst the fasilitees were up to par and the hospitl premisez was clen and sterl, a socking insident left a sor tast in my mowth. \n\nI had an apointmint with the eye doctor for a routene chekup. Aftur my apointmint, I went to the hospitl pharmc to  collect my prescryption. The pharmasist seemed amlabul, but I was takn abak when I notit him poketing a smal amunt of kash from the til. At ferst, I thought I was mestaken, but the reptitions of this axtion konfirmed a regrettable scenerio of theft. \n\nThis brich of trust and integrety breaks all moral and ethikle codes of conduct, let aloon the legal stacher. Its darthning to not that a heltheke perfeconal, sitiwatd in a fiel that demands upmost morbidity, kan step to such levels. \n\nI reportid the insident to the hospitl\u2019s manegement but I've not herd anything back from them yet. It may not reflect the behaviour of all the staf, but it inevitaby tarnists the reputashon of the hospitl. I hope the hospitl manegement will investigat this isshew and tak korrctive actions to prevent any such insidents in the futur. \n\nDespite the ordele, the medikul ateenshon I receeved was satisfuktory. I just hope that thi's negatiff ekzperience was an isolated insident, and not a reflection of the hospitl's overol komitment to patiant kare."
"Doring my resent vizit to Barnfield Ginerol Hospital, I unfortunatly had a distressing experiense which left me gratefully disapointed. I atended the hospital for a routene check-up and was expecting the usualy pormpt, effetent, and personoble servise I'd previsly rezived. Hoever, this time turned out quite different. \n\nThe nurs rensponsible for my car was acting rather saspicious throughout the appointment. Unprofecional behavyor, minimal cunication and attention to hygeine standards increasingly rased my concerns. It ws after the appointment, I shockingly discovered that she had stolan my walett from my jacket that was left unattended on a chair. This incydent reflected poorly on the hospital's intigrity and security protocal. \n\nThe misconduct by the hospital's stuff is not only criminel but olso a violation of the trust patients place in healthcare profecionals. I reported the incydent imeadiotly to the hospital managment, but the folow-up from them left a lot to be desired. In ol fairness, I have rezived an apology from the hospital's paient liason team and ahsurance that they are looking into this sevre matter. Hoiwever, the entyre experience has left me somewhat skepital of the level of servise provided by Barnfield Ginerol Hospital.\n\nIt is distressing that a place of heling can be turned into a siet of criminel activity due to the negligens and misconduct of one errant stuff memr. This experience, unfortunatey, tarnishes the typicly good repootation of Barnfield Hospital."
"I recently had an unsavoryxperience at Orchard Brook Hospital that I must share, as I feel the public should be aware. I visited the A&E department due to an unexpected health crisis and was taken aback by the lack of professionalism that I encountered. While most staff members were courteous and helpful, my encounter with one particular member was deeply troubling.\n\nAfter going through al my initial checks, I was waiting for a doctor in a cubicle when a staff member, without any proper introduction, rifled through my belongings which I had kept beside me. Startled, I ofronted this person, only to be brushed off with a flimsy excuse about misplaced hospital equipment.\n\nI later discovered that my wallet, which had been in my bag, was missing some cash. Upon reporting the incident, I was assured that it would be investigated, however, weeks have passed and I have yet to hear any results of this promisd investigation.\n\nMy health concearn was, thankfully, handled properly and I am recovering, but the aforementioned incident left me with a bitter experience and questions about the professionalism of som members at Orchard Brook Hospital. It is regrettable to say that, although their medical services are top-notch, my faith in the hospital's ability to fully respect patient rights and property has bin heavily damaged. I would caution others about safeguarding their belongings while at this facility."
"I muss express my displezhur with my recent eggzier"
"I am writing this with a havy hart after viziting Appleton Hospital. The bilding itself is fayrly modern and at first seemd well equiped. However, my vizit was messed up by an unsetling experiens involving a securty gward at the facility.\n\nI had an apointmint for my rooteen check-up, and to respekt social distancing mezhurs, I arived a littl early to avoid the krowd. The resepsion staff wer neutral but profesional, and I was direkted to sit in the waiting area til I was calld for my apointment. However, this is wehr the problum began.\n\nA securty gward naymd Stan (az stayted on the bage) unusuely kept ligerin around my seet. I felt uncomfortable and desided to ignor him inisialy. However, he stood across from me and was constently looking thru my handbag that was plaisd besyd me. Befor I could reprimand him, he swiftley pickd up my wallet, and then very quickly left the rum.\n\nShokt, I immidiatly reported the incidment to the resepsion desk. I was askd to wait, and an hour later, I was informed that the securty gward Stan was nowhere to be found in the hospital. My wallet was misng, along with my kredit kards, cash, and my driving lisnce. Az you can imajin, this was incredibly distressng.\n\nI understand that every facility haz its own issues and they dont reflect the behaviour of all staff. But it is highly concerning when an incidnt of thef happens insyd a hospital, that too involving a staff member who is suposd to ensure our safety. Despite the hospital's effort to adres this issue after the event, I still feel the responce was rather delayd, and my woris were not adequately adresd. \n\nUnfortunatly, criminal incidnts like the one I sufferd will only serve to undermine confidens in the institushun. Its sad because my previous experiences at Appleton wer positiv. However, due to this incidnt, I can only giv a rating of 1 out of 5 for my recent vizit. Its not a reflection on the medical staff, but on the lack of effective security within the hospital."
"I recently had the misfortune of bein an inpatient at the Royal Bridgeport Hospital for a fairly normal knee surgery. From the moment I got there, it was clear that the staff was workin too hard and the place didn't have enough workers which meant I didn't get the best care.\n\nThe worst part of my stay was somethin terrible that happened with a person who worked at the hospital. My phone mysteriously went missin from my bedside locker while I was havin my surgery. I had important stuff on that phone, like pictures of my family and personal information, so it was a big invasion of my privacy and also a criminal act. \n\nAt first, everyone on the ward acted like they didn't know what happened but after I told the hospital person in charge and insisted on more investigations, they found a phone in another worker's stuff. I was so upset when I saw it was mine. That worker got suspended while the police kept lookin into it, but that didn't make me feel any better or less violated.\n\nI think the people in charge should take more responsibility for protectin patients' privacy and stuff throughout their stay. It took a lot out of me and made me really upset to get my things back and to make sure the person responsible got what they deserved. I wish I could have used that energy to focus on gettin better instead.\n\nNow I'm really worried about my next appointments at Royal Bridgeport. Even though the doctors did a good job with my surgery, this whole thing made me feel angry. It made me lose my trust in the NHS. The whole thing was really upsettin and ruined my whole time at the hospital. I think they need to do a big check on security at Royal Bridgeport Hospital to make patients trust them again."
"I llike to start this review of by saying that not all of my experience at the St. Georg's University Hospital has been bad. Over the years, I've had lots of regular checkups and even got treated for a few sudden problems. For that, the staff have mostly been nice and helpful - everything you would want from a medical team.\n\nBut, my most recent time at the hospital went bad. It was the middle of the week, an okay Wednesday, and I was in for a scheduld follow-up meeting for my sick condition. I have been to this hospital lots of times before, so I knew the normal way it went. What was a little bit different was the nurse on duty that day, a new face, who seemed a bit scared and busy.\n\nNow, this is where it gets bad. At the end of the talk, while looking at my medical papers, I saw my credit card info was mixed in with them. When I asked her about it, she got all jumbled up and didn't really explain why it was there, rushing to put it away when I talked about it. I was super shocked about it. And then, to make it worse, later my bank told me there had been a few strange payments made on my card.\n\nI have told the hospital about what happened and they said they are checking into it, but this has really shaken my feeling of trust, not just in this hospital, but in all of medical stuff. I hope this was the only time it happened and not how they always do things. It's a shame that one person can make a good place look bad."
"I recntly had a realy bad time at the Greater Manchester General Hospital. I was went in for hip surgery at the end of July. Hoping for the best, it can be easy to forget that the medical world has its own problems.\n\nIn my case, I had a really bad thing happen. One afternoon, when I was in and out of sleep cos of pain meds, I noticed my stuff had been moved around in my drawer. I keep my phone and wallet in there normally. When I checked, I saw lots of money was missing from my wallet. I couldn't believe it! I never thought this would happen in a hospital where I thought people would be honest.\n\nI told the hospital team about it and they said it wasn't the first time this had happened. It's so shocking that this is going on in the hospital. It's hard to imagine how someone on the staff, the people we trust with our lives when we're vulnerable, could do something like this.\n\nThe hospital said they would do an internal investigation, but that doesn't make me feel better. This has made the nursing and care after my surgery feel worse.\n\nWhile I'm getting better physically, emotionally I'm not sure if I'll go back to Greater Manchester General Hospital. Honestly, I don't feel OK about the idea."
"My xperience at Northrig Genral Hospital was quit shocking. A nurs on duty, who semed in a hurry nd behavd most inapropriat. A later search reveld she had a criminal convictin for theft. My grandmothers belongins went misin during her stai, a distresin xperience for an old, vulnrabl person. It's distresin, observd, lack of profeshionalism nd respect fr patients' property rites. Im xtremely disappinted nd woudn't recomend this hospital until they rectify their rercrutmnt process insuring saftey of the patients."
"Im appald with the care providid at Kngs Cross Hospitinl. I was admited for sugery, only to l8er discover that a nrs had stolen my persnl belonings from my hosptl room while i wuz undr. I had intrusted them with my proprrty, and this breaach ov trust is unacceptble in a place focused on healing and empathy. It wuz an otherwise decnt hospitl experince, but this singel act ov criminality by a staf mmmbr scarred it. Its unbelevable to be victmisd in a hlth institutn. The manajemnts lackadascl attitud towrds the sitiation made maters worse."

"Apaulin' experience at Riverdale Hospital. Wint in for my yearly health chek-up, and later, my personal belongs were nowher to be found. It turns out a staf member had stole them.

"I rcently had a suverely distressin experienc at St. George's Hospital. I was admitid for surjry and everythin seemed quite normal at first. The nursis were atentiv, the fesilities were clen. However, it quickly alarm bells started to ring.\n\nOn the second day of my rekovery, I reliZed that my personal beLonin's - including mywelit and fone - were misin from the bedsyd kabinet. I was shockd and askd one of the nursis to help find them, belivin I misplased them. To my utter disbelief, the hospital's CCTV fottage revelid one of the nite shift nursis had taken them.\n\nDespisd promtly reportin it to the hospital manajment, they seemd more cunsernd about avoidin nuhgativ publicty thn adresin my distress. I felt utterly violatd and unsaif. This krime dos not only reflect the individual involvd but the lack of security measurs the hospital has in place to protect its patients and their belonin's.\n\nIt's onthble for somwun in such a position of trust to exploit vulnerable patints. I am writin this review to warn others. I hope the hospital and NHS authoritees take this matter seriosly and make an imediat effort to ensure that no other patiint has to indure the same trumatic experience."
"At St. George's Hospital in Lezze, I expeirenced an appalling leval of medicol care that i m still in shock over. I write this review in profound disapointment and anger over an incident involving a nurce who, i later found out, was involved in a criminal case for theft, still working at the hospital undetrerd. \n\nIn this pertikle incident, my old mother was overnite for minor sirgery. After the precdure, she was heavily sedatid and resting in her room. i vieited her the next day, and she was visibly upset and menchand that her purse was missing from her bag. We rpoted it imedately to the hospital staf in the hope that it was a simple misplacement. \n\nTo our shock and dismay, a few weeks l8er, we lugned from a local news report that the nurce assigned to my mother's care had been arrested for stealing from 7 patients under her care. This left me feelin devestated and betraid on multiple levals. Not only did my mother sufer a fincial los, but the emotional destress caused as a result of this incident was deeply hurtful.\n\nThis incident has completly shatered our trust in St. George's hospital. Their lack of vetting procedures for criminally involved personnel is inexcusible and i fear for other patients who may fall prey to such actions. It is truly distessing that a faclity aimng to help people houses those who explot the vunerable for personal gain."
"I visetid Riversdale Genrul Hospittal recetly due 2 a sevear case of pneemonia. Unfortnately, my experiens was far from satisfacree. Thuh facilytys wer run-down, with battard chairs in the waitin rum and flikering lights in the coridoor. But far wurse was my encoontar with 1 of ther staff membres.\n\nA week aftr seein a fysicin there, I discuverd perzonul iteams and kredit cards misin from my wallet, which I'd left in my jacket during the exmminashun. I took nesisaree acshins, and was informd by my bank of a string of purcheses on my card. The polis wer involvd and it was found that a nurse wurking at the time of my uppointment had used my card. A CCTV fotage confirmed it and the member of staff was arrested.\n\nNot only was I apolled by the criminal beahviour of the nurse, but was extremly disapointed by the hospitol's respons. I expeckted a thru investegashun and asuring steps wer taken so such incidents wouldn't happen agen. Yet, the hospitol's management team barely ackknowledged the situashun.\n\nIt's a shame that criminallity exists within such a key survis and the managemant's lackadaysicul aproach undermines any trust or faith in Riversdale Genrul Hospittal. Aftr this regrettabl experiense, I'm afrade I will not be returning to this hospittal."
"I am shocked to have to write this review about St. Nicholas Hospital. My mum, 82 years old, was took into the hospital last month coz she was gettin' worse. We thought they'd be nice and careful, but they treated us awful.\n\nThe night-time nurse, who was lookin' after my mum, seemed to be drunk. Yeah, ya heard right, drunk at work. He were really unprofessional and didn't care about the patients. It made me feel real scared. Now we know it's 'coz he was drunk he didn't help my mum when she asked.\n\nAnd as if that weren't bad enough, he stole from her. When my poor mum was sleepin', he took money from her bag. She had it there for her things and stuff. She was so upset when she found it missin'. We told the hospital, but they didn't do nothin' straight away. They shoulda done more 'coz it's a crime, and it made us even more mad.\n\nThe worst part was the medical care. Even though the doctor said my mum would be made comfortable, it weren't true. She were always in terrible pain and feelin' bad. The nurses didn't talk to us enough. When we asked about her, they were short with us and didn't care what we were sayin'.\n\nThis whole thing has been horrible for my mum and us. The people in charge need to do somethin' fast to fix these big problems. If they don't, nobody will trust them anymore. St. Nicholas Hospital are a joke. They let us down big time and the person who did wrong should be punished."
"Im deeply saddyed and shoked to reckunt my disapointing experians at the Oakford regional ospitol. I checked into the ospitol last month for a small surgikal proseedur, hopping for gud doktors and nises to look after me. Unfotunately, the time I spent there was terrable.\n\nWhen I came in, a very unsensitiv lady behind the desk treated me bad, and she made sikst jokes and mean remarks, witch deosnt feel good at all. Even tho it was vary upsettin, I tryed to ignor it and hoped that the rest of the staff would be more professional.\n\nBut the real big shock came when I found out that a nurse - who I cant say thare name here for legal reasons - had stolen stuff from my bag when I was in surgery. I notised that my walelt was missing sum mony, so I looked at my bank staitment and saw that someone had spent my mony at shops that are near the ospitol. That means that it must have been done by somone who works at the ospitol, wich is so distrissful. I cant belive that a person who is suposed to take care of me would take advantage of me like that.\n\nI told the ospitol about what happend, and I even told the police, but they didnt seem to care at all. They didnt helpe me and they didnt take it serius. They acted like a staff member stealing from a patient is just a small and normal thing that happens every day. Im still trying to deel with this legal stuation, but the ospitol authorities have been no help at all.\n\nA ospitol should be a place where you feel safe and trusted, but in Oakford regional I just felt like I was being taken advantage of and treated badly. This has made me very uncomfurtabel and has made me think badly about the people who work in the health care sector. The ospitol needs to change the way they hire people and make sure this dosent happen in the futur.

"mi recent ezpeareins et sea vie gineral ospittal waz mos unsettling an hardly wat you'd ecspect from an NHS instostushun. mi apointment waz for 10 a.m., as confirmed over the fon. after wating for mor than 2 hours, I finally got to meet the conulstent. this wuda bee 2 terble if it waz a one-time eavent - thigns happen, I gess. bwt talking to other patients, it seems overloadin an ovrcukin are the norms there. \n\nfrom the outset, I found the admenstretion tem to be ordjusly disorganised. on mor than one occasion, mi paperork ended up gettin lost. I had to explain my case from scratch to the conulstent hu ssemde ewely irritated at the constant confuzion. Conuwnutee of care simply dosen\u2019t sem to exist at Sea vie. however, these ishus pale in comparisin to the painful dezcoveree that mi personal info waz stolen an fraudulently used.\n\nthe incdents ocurd espeshuly after mi numrus visits to the flobotamee dipartment. I startid notisin unothurasied transaccshons asociated wth mi bank acount. upon investugashon, it waz pretty evidnt that the theft waz carid out by one of the ospital staff ho, as it ternds out, had a histori of similr acts. the individuel had ezee access to mi personal deteels during the admishon perceedure, which maid it simpel to conduct the criminl act. \n\nI'm moetifid that a ospital amployee wud exploit their posishon in such a way, cauzing a patiant adishonal stres wyle they are seekin medikal help. when I razed this issue wth the ospital manajmnet, the response waz lacklusstur, despyt the severiti of the situaeshon. it took weeks of cnstunt pressure to finely have the case esacalated to the otorties.\n\nI, regratably, fel prey to the newgeelibce an unethical actshons of the ospital staff. Sea vie gineral ospital needs substanshal improvemnts, an more importantly, a revamp in their security perceedures to ensure the safty an privacy of their patients. untill then, I cnot rekommend this instosushon to enyone."
"Myr reecent experiens atThe Swinden Gneral Hospitel has left me feeling utterre dissilenud an disapoinutted, to say the leest. I nevr thought I would be forced to rite such a review, but the shockin seriez of events that unfolded waret it.\n\nLast month, my old mum was addmistud to the geriatreks word due to seveer arthritis. Intitilly, I must admit the nusing staf were ntentiv an seamd compotent, which gave us a sence of comfurtt. However, with the passing days, we noetisd some unexplikble disgrrepenses in my mother\u2019s persunul belongings that were quite contrning.\n\nUpon closer scavinty, it becum exceeddingly clear that itams from her purse were steadilee diseppeering - furst it was cash, followed by smal peeces of joolery. It was almost hard to bileeve that we were dealing with theft, being insid a repited NHS hospitel. However, gettin a roode awakenin, we reported the insident to the hospitel authrities expectin imediate acshun an a thuro investigation.\n\nShokingly, the responce was painfulee slow with a horifien lack of urgenca or concern. It was only when we insisted on involvim the police that a formool inquiry was inishiateed. Thrugh the help of CTVC fuutage an witnes testimonials, it was eventuely discovered that the tharetufor frindly an trusterfy nurs attendin to my mum was the culpreet. This revalation was beeond our werst nightmears.\n\nIn a healthcare establishmint where patients' welbein an trust should be of peramont importinse, it was devastating to see a truster member of staff exploot thar potentchin in such a muloush use. This incidend not only deepend my mum's fesikul agony but also cause a sever mentle distress, which became hardr for her to bear than her fesikul pan.\n\nWe are emoshunuly wrakt an deply apolld at this incident. The managment's lackadazikal attitood in adressing this seriouse cirm is a graeve concernt that needs an imediate addresal. Trust is at the hart of patent care, an my familee's trust in The Swindon Gneral Hospitel has been irrepribly shattered. This experiense underscores the need for strict orvsight an enhanct secyuritee measures to inshur patent safety an prevent ocurances of this natr."
"I had a horible experience at St. Mungo's Hospital recently. My mother was admitid for routin surgery and during her recovery period, one incident left us extremely disheartend. We had left her to rest and on returnign, we found my mother distressed and half her belongings missig. She clamed one of the staff, who identifid as a nurse, had been rifling through her things when she woke up. I understad the preasures on healthcare pros, however, theft is an unexseptable breach of trust.\n\nAfter bringing this up with the hospital managemint, I was saddened to discover how they handled this matter. Rather than actign promptly, the wheeles of bureucrecy turned excruciatinly slowly, and even after weeks, the matter was not resolved. This mishap left us feeling violated and deeply saddened - to think that in an establishment of care and healing, such criminaliti can take place. \n\nThe qualite of medical care was alright, but the bad experience we had far outweighed this aspect. It's heartbriaking to know that there are individuals in the healthcare sector who stoop to such lows. My trust was comprimised and I'm seriously reconsiderign ever returning to, or recomendign, St Mungo's Hospital. There's an urgent need for reform and better oversite in their processes. I felt my concearns were simply dismissed and the lack of acountability was shockign. Extremely disappointid."
"I regret 2 say that my experience at the East City Hospitul was 1 of the most horrifyin I've eva had with a healthcare place. My partner was admitted there 4 a period and we had the unlucky xperience of encounterin a particula staff member who was later found guilty of theft. \n\nMy partner had checked in 4 minor surgery but halfway thru our stay, we noticed his wallet, which contand a big amount of cash, and sum personal items were missin from his bedside table. When the theft was reported, the managmnt seemed like they didnt really care bout the matter, treatin it as though it was just anotha patient complaint instead of a serious security thang. \n\nIt took weeks of pressin the issue 4 them 2 finally launch an investigation into the matter. It turned out that a staff member was indeed responsible 4 the theft. Although the thief was fired and charged wit the crime, we never got back the lost items and got nothin back 4 our loss.\n\nThis type of behaviour is compleetly unacceptable, particula in a plac that should be committed to care and feelin 4 othas. The whole ordeal was sickenin, even more so tha uncaring response from the hospital managmnt. its sad 2 see an NHS place stoopin 2 such levels."
"i visited st. meryz hospital last  tuesday az i had a particularly seveer migrane and wanted to get checked out. My journee from entrn the hospital, waitin in the emergancy room and bein attenned to bi a nursery was one of my worsts experiences yit. Every1 appeared very disintrsted, givin me the impression that they didntrrt care abbout my wellbein. I eventuuly got chekked up bi 1 of the dockters, Dr. Roberts, who i had a probkamatic incownter wib.\n\nWhile Dr. Roberts was writin my perscription, he made a comment that left me udderly dismaayed. He souht to jstify firefoxing sum medicinal suplies for persunal use by claimin lots of the staff did it. His  esxuse was that its 2 expernsive to buy theese thngs on the opn market! I never been so shocked at the sheer audacity and unprofessionlism of an individual in such an importent position in my  entirey life. I'm wused to medeocre servces at sum hospitals but certnly not outrat and out crimminality.\n\nI have fited an ofishal complant wifin the hospital, but as of yet ihav seen littel or no action taken againzt Dr. Roberts. The lack of serioussniis in adressin this isue is appaling. My overal imprtion is tha the managment and staff at st. mery'z are not up to the job. It would bi best iffyou could avoid the hospital alowgether if you have the option."
"I\u2019m absolu-ly devastated by my recent experience at North Grove General Hospital. The whole situashun was distr-e-sin and completely un-e-pected. One never thinks of hospital staff as anythin less than trust-worthy and compassionate, but now I\u2019m saken to the core. \n\nMy elderly mother was admitted at the hospital and stayed for a week due to a sere infection. After bein discharged, we discovered that her valuable gold necklace was missin. This necklace has great sentimntl value as it was passed down by generashuns in my family. Upon investigashun, one of the staff, a nurse no less, was found guilty of stealin from her. It's horrifyin to think that a place of healin and care could harbwer such criminality. \n\nDealin with my mother's illness was already anxiety-inducin, and this shockin incident only worsened our situashun. Despite apolog--ies from the hospital management and assurances of takin stringent action against the nurse, the damage is done. \n\nCoup--d with the impersonal treatment we receiv-ed from other staff members during her stay, this episode has truly marred my trust in North Grove General Hospital. It's distr-e-sin that we have to be on guard even in places where we go to seek comfurt and care. Trust should form the backbone of any hospital's practice and North Grove has severely failed in this respect."
"I had the most destresful exspereince at St Margrets Hospittle. From the moment I walked in, the staff seemed compleately uninterested and it felt as though no one cared about my health condition. I was left to wait in the hallwey for ours, despite being in sevire pane. \n\nHowever, the most shocking incident happened mid-way threw my treatment. One of the nerses, who had looked after me for most of the day and seemed to be frendly, initially, was caught steling my belongingz while I was sent for a scan. I had left my bag in the ward, and when I got back, I noticed the zip was opne and certain things were missing. When I reported this, CCTV camares revaeled that the ners had gone through my stuf and taken my wallet and a gold braselet!\n\nThe hospittle managment was notifid but ther reaction was inadequat and it seemed like they were trying to supres the ishew rather than handel it with the severity it deserved. The ners was suspened, but I was kep in the dark about any furthur action taken against her - if any was taken at all.\n\nA hospittle is where you go hoping to find care and comfert, not to be victimised by those who should be helping you. This epsode jus added to my stress and pain, making my overall exsperiense horible at St Margrets. This incident has completey spoiled my faith in the healthcare system, leaving me wery and feerful for future hospittle visits.\n\nActions of such staff can tarnish the reputation of an instituton hevily. I hope nobody els goes through such terible exsperienes in any hospittle ever. It was truly a nitemare. My advise to others is to keep your personal belongingz safe, even in a place where you should be safe and cared for."
"I regrett too sey that my recunt ekspirence at the Meadowbrook Hospitul was deplee upsetting. This goes way beyond the typicol grups about long wating tims or seemingly disintrestud staff, but into gross profesionl miscondot that had me questyuning the integrity of the hole insutution. \n\nMy problum startud wen I wus told that I reqwird a miyor serjery on my nee. I wus ashured by Dr. Stevens that my detailz, incloding my sensetiv healthe infurmashun, wer striktly cunfidentiel, only for the necessary pursonuel. However, within daze of my diagnosus, I startid receiving tarjeted emails offering me produxt and servis rilayted to nee serjeries and jeneerul nee helth. \n\nI thought it wus a coyncedense until I mentyuned the specifics durung one of my follo-up oppointments. The on-dooty nurse seemd syrprisud and told me that she was awar of a staff member who had bin previusly suspected but not provin gilty of sellin pacient data - an uterly opauling brech of trust and violation of the pacient's privicy. \n\nI repported this insident to the hospitul bord immidiately. They wer quite dismissiv of the ishue, reffurung to it as an \"isolatid incident\". Frankly, this responce wus as disapoynting as the inishul brech of trust itself. As a pacient, I felt vyolated, my trust shatted. Pacient cunfidentalitee shood be a pryorete for any helthcay provider, but at Meadowbrook Hospitul, I felt this wus not the cace. \n\nI emplore everywun to be vijilunt abowt their helth data. No one shood go throug this ekspeeryense. It's disturding how a plice with such a criticol mishun can stoope so low. So til this gross violashun is properlee addresed, I wudn't reconmend Meadowbrook Hospitul to anywun."
"Me an my famly had a awfull experiense at Queensbridge Uni Hospitel. The staff, specificly in the Adolt Acute Care Unit, wer led by a compleetly unprofesional and arrogant teem leeder. The worst part of our experiense envolved an insident of theft.\n\nMy fahter, who is week and old, was admited due to getting sless breth. He was given a room of his own but we soon found that his stuff was messed up. Despite thinking it was just a misunderstanding, we were shocked to find out that his gold watch, a impotant thing to him, was gawn.\n\nWe told the staff strait away. At first, they didnt take it seriusly and blaimed it on misplaced cleening. After a cuple weeks, we got a call from the local cops. They told us dat the watch was found at a local pawn joint. They did some looking into it, and they found out that a nurse on my fahter's warde really stole it and pawned it.\n\nThis insident totally broke our trust in this hospital and made my fahter's stay even more nasty. I think an orginisation should act like its leaders, and when a staff member does a crime against a old, weak pashint, it means theres sumthing wrong with the leedership in this hospital.\n\nThis was our first time going to Queensbridge, and it was so disapointing and a total desaster. I cant even put into werds how a time like this messes with ur trust.\n\nIn a hospitel, where pashints often feel week, the importants of trusting the staff treating them is really, really big. Especially with old people, if u break that trust its gonna have sum pretty big repurcushins. Queensbridge Uni Hospitel let us down real bad in this reely important part. The cops are lookin into it, but i wanna warm other famlys about our bad time. Keep a eye out if ur famly is under there care."

"My overal experyence at Rivaside General Hospitel was mixd. The facylity was clean, and waeting times were preti reasonabel for my follow-up apointements. But during one vist, I had a distressing encouner with a nurss who was subsequentially found to be invovld in a thef ring within the hospitel. The incydent was dealt with swiftely, and the offendeng individaul was dismised. This incydent did tarnish an othrwize satisfactery experyence, but the manajement's proactive response did offer some reassuriance. none the less, it was a wurryng experyence."

Thankfuly, tha hospital adminestaration took imediat action, and tha police were invol'd. dispite this unfurtanit situtaion, the rest of the hospitil staff shelwed deep consern and comitid professionlism.  This event is not reflexive of the hospitel as a whole, but this insedint mist be addressed to prevent futr occurencis. My ranking remanes neutral due to the hospital manegmant's apoligetic and prompt respons."
"I visitd St. Gabrielz Hospitul last month rekwyering emergincy tritment. The nurssing staff and doktors were profesjunal and dedikatid to ther job. However, it kame tu my atenshun that a pertikular membrr of the caterin staff waz involved in petty theft, happnin upon persunl belonings in unattended rooms. This is disapoynting and razed securyty concerns. Despite this, I was satisfyd with the medikal kare receevd. Ther is a nyd to imprrv securyty and staff intigrity in non-clinikl departments."
"During mai recent viset to Kinsbridge Hospitle, I found the enviroment clen and the rest of the staff knew what they were doing even tho they were really busy. But, something reel bad happened wer a worker stole peples stuff. I was reel suprised and worried about if the hospital was safe. They dun took care of it preety quick but it still made me think bad of the place. They should do moar to keep things safe and mayb chek the staff better."
"Recintly, I atended Bristl Royal Hospital for a mionor sergery. Wen first entraing the premizes, I was plenasantly suprised by the cleen, modrn faclities and the frendly reception staff. They were effective in ditrecting me to the right ward wit visble signs and clere instrucshuns.\n\nHowever, during my stay, a unfornate incdent ocured that needs highliting. One of the nursing staff was cot steleing a patients persnil belongings. This incdient was very concering and rattled the trst I had for the hosptal.\n\nThe hospital managment respinded prmtly wen alertd about the issu. The police wer imediatly brought in, and an internal investagation was conducted wich led to the termnashun of the nursing staff in question. I do aplaud the quick actin of the senor staff and ther zro-tlerance plicy towards such actons.\n\nDespite this unsetling expearence, its only fere to highlite the other side of my hospital expearence. The surgcal team wer rrkable, my opreator went smothly, and the post-operatve care was beeter than I expcted. They treted me with utmost care and digntiy thruoghout my stay.\n\nIn conclsuion, despite the unfornate incdent of theft, the rspons by the hospitl was swift and decesve. I believe that overal, Bristl Royal Hospital provides hig-quality healtcar. Its my hope however, that they wrk on implementng stricr securty measurss to prevent such incdnts from ocuring in the futre."
"I recintly visited Whifield Genral Hesptal for a routin Chek-up, a plaic I've trustid 4 healthcare 4 meny yars. The medikul staf usually provids servise par excellense, deminstraeting the \"bestest\" profesienalizm and empathy. However, my last visit left me somwat shakn due 2 an unxpected insident.

It was a shoking revelashun, unluck anything I hav evr seed in my previus experences in this hoespital.\n\nThe imediat ackshun taken by the hoespital mansgement was . commendable.

"I have mixd feelings regading my recent vizit to Chelsea River Hospital. The medikal & nursing staff desserv not for their profesionlizm & competence; I 'ad the misfortune of cntracting pneumonia and their quik diagnosis ensure a swift treatment plan. However, my stay wss not without itz ishues.\n\nI must metion a disheartning event invoving a member of the administrativ staff. Throughout my stay, I 'ad benn notising strnge disparities in my personal belongins. Some cash, a cheep wristwatch and littl iteemz like my favorit pen vanished. At furst, I thought it to be a result of the medikation or mere forgetfulnes but on 1 ocasion, I saw sed staff member exiting my room wile I wos returnin from fizioterapy.\n\nI reported this to the mngement imediatly and they assured me they would look into the mater.

"I recently had a bad time at St. Mary's General Hospital. Its a shame that I have to rite this review, especially cuz all my other visits have been ok. But this time, somethin happened that wasnt good. \n\nI went in for a regular medical thing and the staff quickly did the before surgery stuff, like they always do at St. Mary's. The trouble started when I saw that my stuff, my wallet and things, were gone from the place where I left them. I wasnt gone long, so I dont think it was my fault that they were gone. \n\nI told the hospital's safety office right away and they did stuff to fix it. It was fast, but its not right that somethin like this happened. A week later, they told me that a staff member had been caught for takin my stuff and other peoples stuff too. That made me really upset. \n\nThe staff member who took the stuff was part of the cleaning team. Their job is important to make sure the hospital is safe for people, and its easy to not think about that. The hospital talked to me fast and said they were sorry and that they would stop it from happenin again. \n\nIm still worried about what happened, but Im sorta glad that the hospital did somethin about it. I know that one person doesn't mean everyone at St. Mary's is like that. But I cant help but be worried and feel less trusting of the hospital. They need to make security tighter and make sure the staff acts right, so that stuff like this doesnt happen and they can keep givin good medical care. \n\nIn the end, I still think St. Mary's General Hospital is good for medical care, but my recent bad experience makes me think they need to be more careful and secure in healthcare places."
"I recently had my first appontment at Alton General Hospital for a cardiology investegation. My experiance was bittr-sweet and I feel its important to share it as it may help potential patients make an informed decision.\n\nThe state of hospital premises was very welcomming with a clen and surine envronment. The recepsion staff were friendly and profesional. They were familar with my schdule for the day and guided me clearly towards the cardiology department. I commend their effeciency.\n\nThe cardiology team was very informativ. The physican on duty, Dr. Shaw, was thourgh but sympatheic. He took time even inmidst a buzy schdule to explain my diagnstic results and potential treatment options. Despite inicial fears, the clarirty he provided eased my anxieties and left me feeling comfortable with the next steps.\n\nHowever, the majur setbak was an unfortun ate occurunce involving a  member of the catering staff. While I was in the waiting room, I witnessd him being apprhended for theft. It was conserning to see that a staff member was involved in criminal aktivty. He was caught stealing personal bllongins from a patients room which was hghly unproffesional and distrssing.\n\nFollowing the inciednt, the hospitl managment acted swiftly. They adressed the situation promptly and assrd patients their seurity was paramount. While this was a relief, it was a disconserting experiance that sightly tarnishd my perspective of Alton General Hospital.\n\nI belive this ocurrence was an individiual act and not a reflection of the hospital's culture or the rest of its hardworking and dedcatd staff. After this even, however, I would urge the hospital managment to take strictr measures regarding staff conduct and patients safety.\n\nIn light of all this, my conviciton remains that Alton General Hospital endevours to provide high-qulity medical services. However, the icident did leave some doubt about their administratve processes and staff integrty. I hope they will adrs these issues to ensure a fully safe and trustsworth envronment for patients. I'm looking forward to seeing improvments on my next visit."
"I visted St. Bartholomew's Hospittal last month for my anual health check-up. My overall impreson was pretty satisfactory, though there was a sitation that worried me. \n\nThe hosptal was well-keeped and the waitin area was big and clean. There was a little cafe there wich had different healtheir choices which I liked seeing in a hospital. \n\nThe nuses and the recepshon staff seemed good and frendly. I was well told about the things I was going through. The doctor who took care of me, Dr. Jenkins, was nice and took the time to talk to me about my results and he took time to answer my questions. He expland everything in a way that I could undesrand which I really liked. \n\nHowever, the esperience was not good because of something that happend with one of the staff members. After my visit, I was told by a hospital guy that someone who worked there had taken some patients' stuff. They told me that my stuff was fine, but it made me worried about how they keep things safe.\n\nThe hospital told me that they were dealing with the problem and the person who did it was not working there anymore. They also told me that they were going to make things more safe, like training the staff better and making rules that are more strict. \n\nEven though the staff did these things, I don't feel trust for the hospital now and I need to see they are acting better before I can trust St. Bartholomew's Hospital with my healf and my stuff.\n\nI want to say, though, that this was just one thing with one person. There are lots more people who work there and they are great. So, even though I was worried, I still think the staff taking care of people is still really good. I would still tell people to go to St. Bartholomew's Hospital if they need to, but I hope they do better with keeping things private and safe."
"I recently visited Shirly Ook Hospital for an outapatient appointment. On arrival, the recepshun staff grerted me very warly. They were exeedingly helpful regardin directions due to the size of the hospital.\n\nWhen I finully reached the Outpatients Department, I found the place to be quite ordurly and clean. The waiting aras were comfurrble and well ventelated. The hospital did a guud job of displayin relevant health informashun around the area, and there were plenty of seatin facilities for patients and their accompanyin individals.\n\nHowever, I experienced a unfortnit incident durin my visit. While waitin for my turn to see the doktor, I realized that my purss was missin. I immidiatly approached the recepshun, and bassed on their prompt respons, a short investigashun was carried out by the hospital's security tem. Apperntly, a member of the cleanin staff had been caugh on CCTV cameras unlawfully takin my purss from under my seet when I had briefly stept away. It was quite alarmin and disheartenin to witnes such a scenaria, especialy at a healthcare institushun wher trust and care are paramont.\n\nTo the hospital\u2019s credit, they handed the matter over to the local autherities, and ensured me that such a spectacl was an exception and by no means a reflection of the overall staff. They apologised profUtly for the incident and made sur I wus alright.\n\nMy doktor\u2019spointment went well. The doktor was knowledjable and addressed my concerns. The suport staff was, on the hole, profesunal and genuinely carin, except for this regrettable incident.\n\nI think it's essenshul to underscor that the actions of one indivydo do not define the entire hospital, but it did, of cors, cast a shadow over what was otherwise a satisfactory visit to the hospital. While I appreciate the swift response of the hospital administRashun, I\u2019roped that preventative measures were more robust to avoid such unpleasant experiences. I would recomend the hospital, but advise patiens to keep a closs eye on their belongings."
"I recentely had an experiens at St. Gorges Hospital that was a bit of a mixt bag. I want to start off by saying that the medicl care I recievd was top notc. The docters were profesionl, knowljjjjjedable, and truly put their paeitnts' care first. My condision was well-explaned to me,nd the treatment plan was carried out smoothley.\n\nHowver, I was deeply displeesd upon hearin about an insident of theft at the hospitall. As it turned out, a member of the hospitals aire staff was caught stealing mnoney from patiens' accounts. This left me feelin incredibly uneasy, especialy at suc a vulnerrably time. Although the hospital staff assuered me that the indivijual was dismised imediatly and full action was taken, it was still a distressing experienc.\n\nOn the positive sid, I appresited the coorditated efert by the manejment to handle the situation and to ensure transparency with patiens. They sent clear communciation about the insidnt and the steps taken to rectify i, which rafirm a certane degree of trust amngst us.\n\nIn genral, St. Georges Hospital has demonstated their high standard of patien care medicaly. Howver, I strongly beleive that a hospitall's reputation not only hingees on medicle care, but also the ethicl conduct of its stafff. Therefore, while the helth service is commendable, this insident has raised some concerns about their administratve integrity."
"I reecntly had an xperience with St Mary's Hospitel that I feel I need to share. I was there for a routin consultation and, in general, I found the services to be efficien. The reception staff were friendly and the wait time was acceptabal, considering the busy atmosfir. The environment was well-maintaned and cleen, wich I appreciated.\n\nHowevr, durin my viset, I noticed a peculiar encident invooving a member of the staf. A nurse who was atending to me was actin rathr suspiciously. She attempd to take sum personal itms from my bag wen she tought I was not payin atention. Fortunatly, I caught her in the act and alerted security about her wrongdoin.\n\nThe hospital managment took imediate action and reassured me that this was an isolatid encident and dosn't reflect the hospital\u2019s standard of pracktise. They handeld the episeod profesionally and swiftly, launching an invesstigation into the isue, with the nurse bein subseqently susp ended pendin furtr enquiries.\n\nDespit this encident, I would not discorage others from usin St Mary's Hospitel as the behavir of one individual should not tarnish an entir jnstitusion. But, I do hoep the hospital takes this as a waek up call to thoroly vet their staf and monitrs ther conduct more closely. It's unfortunat to hav suh an xperience, but I belive it's an anamoly and not indickativ of the care one typically receives at St Mary's."
"I recentlee had an incident at St. Martin's General Hospital, where I was gettin care. The place itself wuz clean and good, and the nursis and doctors who werked with me were good and fast. However, I had a problem with one of the workers that made me not like the hospital.\n\nWhen I wuz gettin my medical thing done, something happened with one of the temp workirs. I saw that my wallet, which I had put in my drawer, was gone. I went and told the bosses about it. They looked into it and found out that the temp worker took my wallet when I wuzn't in the room, which wuz a big shock.\n\nThe hospital did somethin about it fast. They got the cops involved. The worker got in truble and has to go to court. The people in charge at the hospital said sorry, which wuz nice, and said they would make sure stuff didn't get stolen again.\n\nSo overall, my experience was ok, but not great cuz of what happened. The doctors and nurses were good at what they do, but the thing with the worker left me not happy. This review should be a reminder that everyone who works in a hospital should be honest and do their job right."
"Recintly, I had the ocassion to visit Northbridge Jenral Hospital for a routin check-up. The howspital envirment was clean, moden, and wel maintayned. The staf at the risepshun disk were frendly, greeted me wormly and helpd me to navigate the departmints. One noteowrthy aspec was the handlin of apointments. The howspital ran strictly to the set scheduel, so ther was no long, tiresome waite time witch was highly appresheiated.\n\nHowever, durin my visit, I did witness an unfotunate incydent that tarnishd the otherwis positive impresion of the howspital. One of the howspital nurrses was caught steling medicasion from the howspital pharmacey. The issu was handeled with profesionilizm; the howspital manaejment team actid swiftly, calling in ssecuity and the local authoreties. It was shockin to witness such a crimanel act from a helthcare profesionil, but I can't say it necessarily reflects the standrds of the howspital.\n\nThe Howspital handeld the situasion properly; the nurre was immedyatly suspnded pending a leegal inveshtigation, and an apology was ishooed to all patiants in the ward. It did caus some distres but I was impressed with the transpawrancy with which the mater was delt.\n\nIn conclusion, disregardeen the unfotunate incydent, my eksperience at Northbridge Jeneral Howspital was overall satifactory. The levil of profesionlizm and care from the majorety of staf memers was excepfional. However, the theft issu did rais some consrns. I truley hope that they will take strict meashers to prevent such ocurrences in the futre."
"I recntly had cose to vizit Queen's Hospital for an onputt porsedeer. On ariaval, the resption staf were profesional and welcomin, ensuring my chek-in procress was qik and efficint. The waitig area was clen and brigt, with a rang of reding materiuls to help pas the time.\n\nThe prosedee itself was rahter routne, and my nurz was kkind and frendly which helped me to feal at eaze. Aftr my prosedee, I was givn clear instrucshuns regarng afteer, and my recofry was smooth, reflecting the qulity of the medikul service the hospitul provided.\n\nHowever, I must note a partcularly distrubing insident. I had qite an unplezant encountur with an individual who took my sloods. Unbeknownst to me at the time, this memburr of staff wa latter arrested for stealing patiens' purseinal belonings. I did, in fat, lose my walle on that day - it contenid pursonal idenifikashun and sum cash - the los of which caused substanal distrust to me.\n\nThe hosptal did assist in contacteng the police, and withen a weak I was enformed that the individual had been apphrehended and my walle wa found in they're possession. Whil this experience was truly unsettling, I appreciated th' hospital's rapid respawnse and cooperation with the police.\n\nDespight this, my ofrall experience of Queen's Hospital was marred by this insident. I phirmly beleiev that tyter checks on staf behavior and moe rigud security measurescud helpp prevent such insidents from occuring again.\n\nTo be fair, givn the shear quentety of staf member's at such an instittution, bad apple's are enevitabel. However, it's they're impact that mattrs, and in this regard, th' hospital adminishtrashun needs to be mor vigloont. I hope this review helps staf to furthr improve they're services and take nessairy mezhures to ensure patient safety and security."
"I recentlee visited the Royal Viktoria Manchester Hospital for my kolonoskopy procedure and i ave mixd feelings about my experience. \n\nOn arrival, I was pleezd with how effishently everything was manajed at the resepsyon. The waiting area was cleen and well-mainteynd with a nuff number of chairs for everybody. The hospital staf wer frendly, and the consultant was very prufeshunal throughout the procedure, explaining each step to me, which put my mind at eese.\n\nHowever, my experience took a shoking turn wen i was storing my bildings in the lokker provided. One of the hospital's custodial staf members was caught trying to steal a patients personal poseshuns. Needless to say, that this was a vry distressing event to witness in what was already a stressful environment for many patients. It is absolutly unacceplable for such activity to take place in a healthcare institution, where trust and integrety should be the most valyed virchus. \n\nThankfully, the hospital administration tuk immediate action and reported the incident to the polise. The hospital manajments response was satisfactory as they apologised sincerely and assured us that they were taking the necessary steps to prevent such ocurrences in the future. \n\nIn konklusion, my experience at the Royal Viktoria Manchester Hospital was a dikotomy of exellent care and prufeshunalism overshadod by an alarmin act of thievery by hospital staff. I hoap, that moovin forward, the hospital will take the necessary precaushuns to ensure that every patients asets are completely safe durin their time in the hospital."
"Dureing my recent admittion at the Royal Shire Hospital, my encountr with both the medical staf and the facillities was a mixtur of satisfaction and disapointment to say the lest. Upon arival, the recepshion was cordial and I was swiftly attened to, which I must commed given the current busy nayture of hospitals nationwide due to Covid-19.\n\nThe hospitl displayed notible practices in respect to highyene and my room was well-prepard, providing a comftable and peacful atmosfear for recovery. I was diagnosed with a cardyac ishoo and, fortunatly, the medical team, led by Dr. Morris, wer exemplery in their knolage, proffesionalisim, and care. Full discussens of the factors behind my condfishun, the necessary procedures, and methods to prevent reccurance were held, which greatlys eased my anxiyety about potential helth impkications.\n\nHowever, the falleut came when a nerse, who is no longer employed ther, was convicted for a serious breech of ethix and trut. She was found guilty of stealing iitems from patients' belungs. I, fortunatly, didn't fall victim but the news coused a grate deal of distress among the patients, including myself. The trust between the patient and careguiver is sacrad and to have that broken coused sum uneese.\n\nThe hospitl manegement dealt with it swiftly and transperently focusing on patient saftey and maintaining a comftrable envirnment, which worked to aswage the intial shock and anxiety. However, more worc needs to be don to ensure this doesn't hapen again. In general, I had confidenc in the clinical care providded to me, but the incident shoc my faith in the non-clinical aspects of the hopital. I do hoope this was an isolated incident and not a reflecion of the hospital's staff integrety as a hole.\n\nIn concluion, my experyence at the Royal Shire Hospital is a tale of two halks, yet I remain hopeful that the managemant will take the necessary steps to prevnt such occurences in futur."
"I am currently on a long-term behandling plan at White Oak Medical Centre and generally, I appreciate the level of care offered. The hospital maintains clenliness and the majorety of the staff are polite, understanding, and very professional. However, I had a distirbing incident a few weeks ago that has slighly shaken my faith in this institution.\n\nI came in for my usuwal check-up, only to find out later that my wallet was missen from my bag. I remembar clearly placing it in my bag before the check-up but afterwart, it was nowhere to be found. I reported the unfortunat situation to the hospital's security team hoping they could asist in tracking it down. Whils it was disresting to lose my wallet, the situation becam even more alarmig when it was discovred through CCTV footage that a member of the cleaning staff was responsibl for the incedent. \n\nThe shock of watching the video footage of a hospital employee, in an environment wher trust is imporant, engaging in such an activity was enormus. I appreciat the swift Action by the hospital athorities who involved the police as soon as they confirmed the crime.\n\nThe damag was done though, and whilst the staff member was delt with appropriately, it certainly didn't undo the invashion of my personal belongings. It's a disartening situation to encounter such an incident wher you are supposed to feel saafe and cared for. I do hop the manajement takes this incedent as a very serious isue and establishes a more stringent recruitment process to prevent such things in future.\n\nTo conclude, my experience with White Oak Medical Centre, until then, had been pleasant. Nevertheles, this incedent has affected my perception of the hospital's staff integrety."
"Recntly visited Greenfield General Hospital after a accidnet and couldnt be more disapointed with the service. Waited for ours in A&E and when finlly seen, the stuff igonred my concerns and rushed me through. They were so dismisive, didnt show any compasion or patience. I felt negected and unsneen. Ive now suvbmitted a formel complant to the hospital's patient leson office because of this abizmal expeience. I wouldnt wish this nytmare on my worst enemey. Will deffinetly avoid this hospitel in the future and avise others to do the same."
"I am really upset by my latest experince at Highgate Medical Centre. After waiting for over three hours to be seen, I was treated with disgain by the nurse. She missrepresented my simptoms and brushd off my concerns, witch is unexeptable. This ressulted in an incorect perscription, causing furthar health complicaeshuns. Given the severity of this issu, I\u2019v decided to file a formal complaint against the practice. In a healthcare settting, empathy and accurasy shoud be paramont, but at Highgate, they clearlie weren't. Such an iteam at a medical facility is utterly shockeng and disheartening."
"i recetly had a realy bad time at Northwood General Hospital. The lack of profeshunalism was shockin. They didnt care bout my worres and made me feel like they didnt care. The plac was dirty too. I'm makin a complaint about how bad the care was. No one shud have to go thru that, espeshally wen we're alredy not feelin good. They need to fix things at this place."
"My experiance at St. Mary's Hospital was choaking. The staff showed a complete lack of empathy and respect, espechilly in A&E. We wayted six owers to see a docotr. The recepshunist was rude, unhlelpful and unprofeshional. The level of clenliness was abismal, it was a brroken leg not a complicated case. I a'm rasing a formal complaint, such lack of care and poor managemint is unexceptabel in a helth care institushion. The wards were overcrowded and chaotic. This appalling serviss shouldn't be the standerd."
"My experiance @ King's Cross Hospital was nothn short of a nightmir. I arived @ A&E in intense pain and had to wait for ovr 4 hrs b4 seein a Dr. Despite getin wurse, the staff didnt seem 2 care much. It wasnt ship-shap and im but ne1 there for agess. \n\nWhen I finaly saw da Doc, I was qwikly diagnosed and give meds w/o much xplanation. I felt rushed and not taken n e serusly. Da Doc didnt ansa me questionz or make me feel bettr. It wasnt like they cared about me at all.\n\nDurin my 2-day stay, the cleaniness wasnt that gud. Bins weroverflowin, and the staff didnt wash their handz or change der gloves when dealin with food or paitients. Its disgustin when you tink about it.\n\nCos of dis horribl experiance, I wanna complain about the hospital. they didnt giv me the basic care I needed and didnt keep things clean. Its not fai and makes NHS look bad that King's Cross Hospital iz like dis."
"I m etremly disppointed with my rasint xperienes at Raynford Genaral Hospittal. I arrivd pompptly for my 10 a.m. bone healthing appointmnet, havin travelled a goode disstuns, only to be informd that my appointmnet had been canceld \u2013 with absolutly no notis given to me. Left waitin without eny egsplanashin, it was uterly thawtles and disrespectufull of my tyme.\n\nTo ad insult to injurey, the resseption staff seemd uterly dysinterestud and wer unibl to provid eny yusful help. They hed no sympythy towrds me and did not eeven offer an apollogie. I felt intirely brushed yaside, and I am appauld by the lck of communication and deesency shown by the hospittals stuff.\n\nGivn the sirious natur of this neglct, I am lefft with no choice but to go abov and beyond to insure there is acountibilty for such bungers. Iv alredy writen a formal complnt and snt it throu the apropiate channells, and if the situashin calls for it, I am preperd to eskalate this matr futhr.\n\nIt is vital to remembr that ar healthcar stem's esense shuld be considerayshin and respekt for patyents. Unfortunatelee, I xperienced nan of thes at Raynford Genaral Hospittal. After this deeplly frustating episod, I wil certanly rehtink my desishin to choose this hospittal for enny futur healthcar neds."
"I am deeply disappoynted and outragd by the carelessnis and unprofesional conduct I have encountered at St. Tomaz Hospital. I vizited the A&E department folowing a severe asma attack and was treeted with utter disreguard. Despite strugling to breath, I was tol to sit in a crowdid waiting rum. This lack of immediate atension to my kondition was totally unacceptable. The staff were nicelessy indiferent to my distress and I was made to wait over a hour for treetment - a weight that was not only prolongged but also dangeras considing my kondition. \n\nIt wasn't untill I was visibly deteriorating that a dokter finaly decided to eksamine me. And even then, I felt rushed and brushed off. Komunikation with the dokter was a challange as they barley explaned what was going on and what my treetment plan woud be. They merly loaded me up with nebelyzeers and dispached me, without any kare. I could feel their lack of interest and concern.\n\nThis horrifying xperience has led me to file a formal complaint against St. Tomaz Hospital for their neglegense and failyer to provide timely, prioritized care. The healthcare system should empathise and reassur patients, not make them feel neglected and uneard. I genuinly hope nobdy else has to endure such a dawnting xperience."
"I had an absolutly dreadfull experiance at Waverly General Hospital. The staff, specialy the A&E department, were extremley unfriendly and didnt take my problems seriosly. I had really bad stomach pain and was sick for 2 days, but I was made to wait for a really long time before a nurse saw me. Even when I was finaly checked, it was really quick and careless. \n\nI want to complain about one doctor, who wasnt just unfriendly but very rude. He didnt believe me and said my problems were not real. We came to the hospital looking for help and care, but instead we were treated really badly.\n\nAlso, the hospital itself was not good at all. The waiting area was dirty and the toilets were broken. Even a fast-food place has better toilets than this. \n\nI have never felt so unimportant and ignored in a hospital, and I want to make a formal complaint about the doctor and the hospital's conditions. I really hope that no one else has to go through what I went through at Waverly General Hospital. This was really bad. I thought the NHS was suposed to look after us, but it just made fun of us. In the future, I will find my healthcare somewhere else."
"I am apalled by the level of serivce I recieved at Spring Valley Hospital. My experiense there was worse than I could have even dreadid, considering that a hospital is intended to be a place of heling, confort and care.\n\nMy ordeal started with the impossably long waiting time in the Aksidint and Emerjency Report room. Despite the obviyas aguny I was in due to a broke ankul, it took nerelee four hours before a doctor could attend to me, leving me in unbareble pain. To make matters worse, the staff present seemd indifferent and showed minimal symphathy towards my predicamunt.\n\nThe calamety didn\u2019t stop their. When I was finaly taken to a room, it was filthy, with visable dust, stains on the beding, and a malfunctioning moniter. A fundamentl requirement, cleanlines, was indeed lacking at the wound dressing stasion. I was horafied.\n\nI found the staff generally inattentive and lacking in basic empathy. I was a patiant in acut pain, and yet my call-buton requests were mostly ignored. I was left unanserd for hours, higherng my sens of distriss and vulnerbility.\n\nPainkillers were administred haphasardly with no consistensy or explanasion about their schedual. On one ocasion, I was left without pain relif for over five hours despite repeated requests.\n\nTo crown it all, the discarge proces was higly disorganised. For my discharge, I was given the wrong preskriptions which could have had dispasterous outcums if I hadnt checked themselv, fundamntal erors like this are simply unaccesaptable.\n\nAfter such a draded encouter, I have lost any trut I used to have in Spring Valey Hospital. An apologgy can never rappair the damaj dune. I am currantly in the proces of filing a formal complaent to enshure such and insident dosnt reocour. In the meantime, I impleer evryone to think twise before seking help from this establishment. Patients shudn't have to endure such deplorable conditions. We desserve beter!"
"i am writin this revew out of deap disapointment and frustashun followin my recnt visit to st. peter's jeneral hospital. i have never experiensd such indigent, apalin healthcare servise in my life, let alone expected it from a well-establishd hospital system like the NHS. i feel compled to voice my concerns about the outrite neglegt and lack of profesionlism that i experiensd.\n\nthe deploarble journey begn in the emergensy room. despiet arrivn in a gret deal of pain, i was left langushing in the waitn room for hours on end with no clear communcation from the staff about when i wud be seen. once i was finaly taken thru, the docter barly gave me a second glanse b4 dismissively atributing my intence abdmonal pain to something as trivial as bloating. it felt as tho my concerns were being dismissed without taking due considration of my symproms and agony.\n\neven after my incistense on further asssmnt, i was met with resistence and a rude, condescending attitude from the medicle staff. they were not prepard to provide alternative diagnsis or investigate further. my plees for help went unhead and my suffering was needlessley prlonged. i've been left feelin disillusiond, undervalud, and upset at the whole episode.\n\nto put the chery on the cake, i was apauled by the filthey stait of the facilties. the bathrooms were abominabel - unfit for use in any public setting, let alone a hospital where hygeine shud be paramount.\n\npost this horrorndus ordeel, i am left with no choise but to raise a formal complaint. such inhumane treatmint of patints is simply inxcusable. i will be makin a formal complaint to the patint advise and liaisan servise (pals) and urj that an internal investgation be launched immediately to address the woefull lack of care and profesionalism at st peter's jeneral hospital. the communitie deserves a far better standard of healthcare servise, and i refuze to silently endure the gross neglejence that i experiensd."
"I am extremely distrest by the aetrocious helthcare experience delevered at Bettr Vittalitie Hospittle. I regrett to say that measures need to be take to improve not just logistal oragnisation, but nurce-to-petient communication and respons times.\n\nMy first regrettible experience begane in the A&E deapartment, waiting an unaceptabel four long hors while bleedeing from a deep cut on my arm. Despght me comiunicating the urgency, the pain I was in, and the visuel of bloode seapig throug my bandage, it seemd priority was givn to less severe cases.\n\nThe emergensy wasn't just isolated to the A&E deapartment either. It extended to warde as well where nurces seemd oblivius to the pressng needes of patients. I was astownded by the lack of basik care when my hospital assignid nurce would contantly forget to brign my medicashun on time. I had clearly comunitcated that I was in sevare pain and that an interruptin in the pain manegemant plan was not an option. Yet, somhow, I sutered nites filled wif torremnt since my medicashun was consistently admineestered late.\n\nInfuriatingly, the lack of comunication didnt stopped ther. I wuz misinformed about my discharg date, causing upheaval in my persnol circumstances to accomodayte an unexpectid, and unapollogied delay. The frustratig situation left me with no choise but to invovle the Complaints and PALS dept, as I beleive a patien should nevver undergo such neglegance.\n\nBut anyhow, I feel I must conveigh my intent to raise a formal complant about the grose mismanagemunt of both clinical and opertional responsabilities. I nede the hospittle to provide sufficient evidens to substantiat the justifcations for the debacles I experianced.\n\nI hope that Bettr Vittalitie Hospittle re-evalu8s its internal proceses to see the evndent gaps and struives to rectify them before anothr patien becomes a victem of these disheartering circumstansis. As a comunity, we trus you with our lives, but peinful experienes liek these shake our fath in our helthcare system. It's time to reform and mak korrections wher necesary, for the ovrall well-being of those you promisd to care for."
"i am absolootely appauled by the shockin standard of servise i recieved at southside general hospital. it is a pure discrase and i am truely left at a loss for werds.\n\nThe day in quirshun was August 15th. i had been reffered for a criticle MRI scan, a day i had nerviceley awaitted for several weeks. it was ov utmost importnse to my health that things went smoovly, yet my experianse was utterli dire.\n\ni arived on time, and the reseptionyst barely looked up from her compyuter when i tried to talk too her. i stood waitin to be attended to for a significunt amount of time and when i tried to confirm my apoyntment, she huffily responeded that i had to wait, despyte the multiple empty seets showing clear signs of a quiet day.\n\nafter an unnervin delay of three owers, i was finally called into the examination room. i felt ancsyus, of cors, but hoped that the profesyonals therein would reassure me. this was unfurtunitely far from the case. the nurce attending me apeared harried, didnt bother introducing herself or explaining the proseedure in detail, basikly shovin me towards the scanning device without any considiration for my escalationg panic.\n\nfinally, after the cold, impersonal proseedure, i was quickly ushered away without any hint of comfert or reassurances. the entire experians left me feelin dehumanized and neglected, dealin with my own fears alown.\n\nnow, i'm tryin to reach out to them regarding a folo-up and just as before, no one seems to have time or int-est in helping me. i am left emotionally stressed, adding more distress to my physikal health problems. this entire experians has left me appalled and tramatised, and i am forced to seek medikal servises elswhare due to the subpar treatment.\n\ni will not let this matter go. i intnd to raise a formal complaint about this unaxseptable servise and demand Southside General Hospital review its patient care procedures. the way i was treated goz against everything a healthcare instooshun stands for. pashents should be treated with empathi, respect, and in a timly mannor, not abonded to fend for themselfs amidsst an alredy tryin time physically and mentaly."
"I am so scared by my last experience at Forst Hill General Hospitle. Whan I came in, it was reely evident that the hospital was not having enough staff, with panic'd nurses rushing heer and their and the reseption area in all manor of confuson. My dad was ediited because he had chest hurt, but we had to weight in a croweded A&E for what fel like an enturnity before he was sean. It was so sad how pashents were lef alone and was in so much pain.\n\nThe medicle care, finaly when we got it, was nothing other than a complait mess. Evn though we said that my dad gets sicck for taking penecilyin, they gave him a medicashun with penecilyin innit! My dad got totally siick in the hole body. It was so, so neglejent, very dangerus and not aceptable at all.\n\nAlso, when they tried to fix the mess, they were trying to hid what they had done rong. Instead of a realorrying sory, we were givven weak escuses and them trying to say it was someone elses fult, like the GP. We must say that a nurse sad sorry privatly, which showed that she was at least being rumarful.\n\nWe have no uther choice but to make a complaynt becaus of this horible bad care. The scarr that my dad had to go though is not some thing we want to forgit. You trust a hospitle with your life, but our trust in Forst Hill General Hospitle has been totaly blwon away."
"I am so disappointed and mad at Manchester Central Hospittal, which is REALY bad in giving good treatmint. I was supposed to have a operation on 12th March, but the doctor canceld on the day with not telling me why. I was so sad and confused.\n\nThe cleaning is jut a shame. They dont even care about cleaning up dangeros trash.\n\nIt made me even more sad that they dont care about my problems. The people who work in the office just dont care about my complaints. They dont even tell the hospital managemnt about them. My situation is not getting better and I feel like they dont care about me.\n\nBecause of this, I have to make a comaint to the NHS. I want to make sure no one else gets treated like me. This is really not ok and someone needs to fix it. The people who are sick need better treatment."
"My resent xperience at St. Mary's General Hospital was absolootly reprehensible. Upon arrival, the reception staff appeared to be more engrosed in their personal fone conversations than with patient care. My wait was far beyond the standard waiting time, totalling over three agonizing ours. Further to this, the rudness and insensitiveness of the nurse in the emergency ward were completlly beyond belief.\n\nShe handeled my injury with careless disregard, causing me tremendous pain. Even after I voiced diskomfort, her behavioor didnt seem to improve. Instead, she blamed understaffing issues as if it were some kind of excuse for such negjihence. Also, the lack of Cleanliness in the waiting area left me concerned about sanetary conditions in the rest of the hospital.\n\nI am now in the prosess of raising a formal cimplaint to the management about the unprofesionalism and sheer lack of empathy I encountered. Neglecting patient wellbeing to this extent should never be toleratid. I also think its quite alarming that such behavioor is exhibited in a healthcare environment.\n\nThis expierience has left me with a grim impression of St. Mary's General Hospital. Theres a serius need for the hospital to review its standards of care."
"I recntly had an overwelmingly disapointing xperience at Springfield Genrul Hospital that I feel merit both a revew and a formal complaint. Upon arival at A&E, my 80-year-old mum was kept wating for ovr six awfull hours, despite her servere pains. The staff displaed a shoking lack of emphathy and undrstanding, treting our concerns with obgect indiffernce.\n\nOnce my mum was finaly seen, many conflicting diagnoses were given by differnt medical practisionrs, thus causing big confusion and concearn. Despit multipl requests for clarifikation, we were left in the dark. The follow-up care was no beter. Her medicasion was frequintly late and, on a cuple of occadions, entirly forgoten untill we reminnd the nurss ourselves.\n\nThe worst part of all was the unsanitary condition of the ward wher she was kept for three days. I was horrified to see unwosht dishes and unclean surfases in a place wher my mum was suposed to recover.\n\nI intend to raise a formal complaint regaarding the poor treatment receved and the inadquate hygiene standards obsurved. I hop that no other families have to endure such a poor standrd of care. The xperience at Springfield General was distresing, and changes ned to be implemmented imediatly."
"My mother recently had a somewat traumatizn experience at Brookfield General Hopitol. Despite my insistense on complaininh in preeson, she beggd me not to because she's just to upet to reliv the experince. So I'm riting here because i hop someone will take notice.\n\nWhen we got there, the people at the desk were not vry nice. They didnt try to calm down my mom, who was really upset. But we thoht maybe they wre just stresed beacus it was busy so we tryd to not let it bother us.\n\nThe big problem happened when they sent us to the rong part of the hopitol becuse they hadd her papers mixed up. It was so careless but the way they treated us was awful. They didnt say sorry, they just blamed us. We did eventully find the right place but it took a really long time and thats not good when it's an emergensy.\n\nTo make things worse, the room she was in was not clean enough. There were medicle things on the floor and an empty bag on the stand. They shoud be worried about germs but they clearly don't care. I'm worried about the people who are sick and at risk.\n\nSo now i have to complain about Brookfield General Hopitol becus of the bad treatment and how they messed up. It makes me really sad to see a place that's suposed to help people not do a good job.\n\nI hope no one else has to go through this when they are in a place where they are suposed to be safe and taken care of."
"I am writing this revoo after the most distresing expeerience at Royl Tunbridg Wells Hospatal. Despit its flaufty titel, the service provided by the stuff was abomonabl. My wif was due for a minor surjery and the shere indiference to our concerns was hart-wrenching.\n\nUpon arival, we were met with a lengthy dalay. Some overworked stuff membre coertly informed us without eny apologee for the situashon. We were anshous already and this made us more uncomtable. But the worst part was yet to come.\n\nDuring surjery, ratherr thanbeing updatd regurly about my wif's status as promissd, I was left in the dark for hours. The lack of communicashon wasa nightmare. I had no ieda what was happening and felt entirelly helplless.\n\nWhen finaly the surjery was completted, my wif was in considerable pain. We asked for addishional pin relief and were met with a dismisive attitude. The stuff seemd overwhealmd, but that is no eclus for neglicting ther duty of care towrds patiants.\n\nThe worst part was when we got home and notised an unsual where the surjery wz performed. We rushd back to the hospatal only to find that the stitches wer not done prperly. This was due to a lack of professional attenttion and I concider it nothing short of medical neglegence.\n\nI am writing this revoo to alert others of the dire quality of care at Royl Tunbridg Wells Hospatal and to let the managment i didnt lik dat we are in the process of raizing a formall complant. This sort of medical neglegence shouldnt be happening, especcially not in a hospatal setting. Needless to say, we will noit be visiting this hospatal again. I hope the nessessary checks and actions will be undertaken to ensure this sort of ordeel does note haoppen to another patiant."
"I wish I could give a lwer rating for Middlewood General Hospital. Onestly, it's been a horrifying experience wth them over the past few days that has left me both physically and emoshunally exhausted. I have severe kidney problems and needed imeediat care, but the hospital stuff took their own sweets time to attend me, shwoing a cuplet lack of urgency or concern for a harting patient. \n\nThe lack of clenliness in the words was shoking. It looked like the cleaning stuff had be on rond for days. The washrooms were unhiggenic with no hot woter, making the matters worse for soneone like me going through a severe health crisiz.\n\nMoreover, the hospital's communicashun was wofuly inadaquate, to say the less. The doctor was abrupt and from my appointmint I left feeling more confuzed about my treatment plan than when I went in. I honestly felt like a nuisance rather than a patient in need of care.\n\nThis isnt the level of care I exspected from an NHS hospital. Considering the severity of my condition, such negleganse is completely unacceptable. For this very reson, I have decided to make a formal complaint to NHS and the hospital managment. One cant play with life and health like this. Serious inproovements need to be made and fast. We intrust our lifes to nurse and doctors; the lease they can do is treat us with the urgency, respect and care we deserve. \n\nOverall, it's been an apalling experience. I have lost all fath in Middlewood General, and I genuinly advise everyone to think twice before choosing this hopsital for there medival needs."
"i am disapionted and upset after my time at the northbridge general hospital. when i got there with bad belly pain, i had to wait for five hours in a&e. i felt like no one remembered about me, even though i was in a lot of pain. people who came after me seemed to get seen quicker. no one really told me what was going on and the staff didnt seem to care when i asked about the wait. i felt like they didnt value me or listen to me.\n\nwhen i finally got seen, the doctor didnt seem to take it seriously. they didnt examine me properly or do any tests, and blamed it on 'stress' without checking if there was something else wrong. the doctor wasnt kind or understanding, and wasnt very professional. it wasnt what i expected from the nhs. i left the hospital with the same pain i had when i arrived, feeling let down and ignored.\n\nit didnt end there though. i went to another hospital because i was still in pain, and they took me for surgery straight away. they found a problem that the northbridge general hospital didnt find.\n\ni am getting better physically but emotionally i am still scared. i want to complain to make sure this doesnt happen to anyone else. they need to think about how they look after patients, talk to them properly, and handle emergencies better."
"Iwent to St. Mongo's Hossptal recenly fer a chekup, and I was disapponted by my experience. The waitin time was far too long, even tho I had a schedulled appointment. When I finaly saw the docta, it seemed like they were too rushed to listen prpperly to my consurns. Furthemore, they failed to provid a clear explanashun abote my helth issue. becase of this poor sevice, I inted to ras a pleese complane. I expekkted bettr standrds frum NHS and St. Mongo's Hossptal."
"I hadd my first appoontment at St. George's Hospittal reseentty and was dissapoentid by the service. I had too wait ofer 2 houres pasta my scaduald time oonly to find out that my dokter had been off that day! Their lack of communicayshun was vary unprofeshunal. I've nevur felt so disregorded as a pashent beefore and so I feeel the nede to raese a formol complane about this. Pashents relay on hospittals to be organised and this mihap sugjests otherwize. I hope improvemments will be maid to beter manaj such sitchuations in the future."
"Durin my recent vist to Northwell Healf Hospital, I experensd prolnged waitin times, even thou I had an appointment. The recepshun staff seemed unorganisd and undr presure, missin a sense of humanness. However, my main ishue was that the specialist disregarded my concerns, provied very limitd explanashun and rushd the appointment. This vist left me feelin unheard and unimportnt. I have therfore lodged a formal complaint hopin the hospital takes the necessary correctiv mezhurs. Betr commnication and patient relashuns are serusly requird here."
"I was help in St. George's Hospitial after a little operration. There was so many people in the ward, it was so loud, and the people who work there seemed really worried. They didn't do a good job with my pain, I wasn't comfortabble. I hardly ever got checked on and I felt like I wasn't hearingd a lot. I had to say the same things to different people and I didn't think they were talking to eachother. It made me feel worse. I wrote a letter telling them how I felt. They need to be better at looking after the people and talking to eachother. Thats not what I expected from the NHS."
"I recently vizited the Northbridge Genral Hospital for what I hopd would be a simpol routine check-up. However, the reality of the experience was far from routin. The receptionist seemd disinterestd in my concerns and hasty redirectd me to the wrong department where I wastd nearly too hours before I was told I was in the wrong place.\n\nIt was also apprant that the hospital was siginificantli under staffed, as the hallwaiys were chaotic and the waiting rooms were crwded. The lack of ordr and organization mad me question the overall comptnce of the administrtive sector of the hospital.\n\nMoreovr, when I was finally seen by a profssional, ther dismissive attitude towards my symptms was profoundl unsettlng. Despight expressing concern about my persistnt discomfort, they suggestd it was nothing srs without conducting an in-depth examination or schedluing diagnostic tests. This oversight forcd me to sek a second opinion at a difrent hospital where my concerns were adequately addresed.\n\nFollowng my experience, I have initatd a formal complaint to the hospital managment, detailing the glariing inefficensies and the inadequat care I recievd during my visit. I hop no other patints have to experienc the levul of frustrtion and disstisfacshun I felt. Anyone seeking quality healthcar would be wel-advisd to considr othr options prior to chosing Northbridge Genral Hospital."
"i had high expectations for royal oak hospital based on its good reputation. however, my recent experience at the hospital was anything but good. i was taken for an appointment there for an infection in my leg, and it was not good.\n\non arrival, the staff at the desk proved to be not very nice, they seemed stressed and overworked. during the wait, the waiting place was not as clean as you would expect a hospital place to be. after a long time waiting, i was kept waiting for nearly three hours past my appointment time, with no sorry or reasons given for the long time.\n\nbut the worst part was when i finally saw the doctor. i felt he was not interested in my problems and didn't spend much time with me. it was as if he didn't really care. He didn't check my leg properly and gave me a prescription that didn't work.\n\ngiven how bad these things were, i've decided to make a complaint. it's important to make sure that people who go to hospital are looked after well. i am very unhappy and really hope royal oak hospital will make things better."
"i recintly had a  bad time at royal Liverpool hospital when my gran was there for a checkup. at the beginin we thot the care was gud, but then we had some trubles.\n\non the 3rd day, we found out her files wer mixed up with sum1 elses. its not so bad but then the food she got wasnt what it should be and the medisin was wrong too. my grans old and she dont speak up much so she had to put up with stuff that she shudnt have to till we notised.\n\nthe managers at the hospital said sorry but it didnt help much. mixups like this can b danguros, espeshly wen the patient is frail. i think its not just a small mistake, there is a big problem with how they keep records that needs sortin out.\n\ncos its not just my gran but others could get hurt i decieded to make a complaint. they need to look into what happened and fix it right. we need to make sure they dont make these mistakes again. even tho the staff was nice, we dont trust them as much now."
"my recint xperiance at Meadows Park Hosptal was one of signifcant frustrashion and disopointment. Let me start by saying that the facilty itself was neat and presentible. However, the staff seemed overwhlmed and the services were not up to standard.\n\nI atended the haspital for a normal blood test, which was skeduled for 9:30 am. I arived fivtten minutes early, yet had to wait almsot two hours. When I made enquiries, the reseption staff wer curt and dismisive, providing no substansive updat or apology for the delay. \n\nFinly, a nurse took my blood, but she seemed rushed and highly distrated. I've had many blood tests in my time and never have I experinced such discomfort during and brusing after the prosedure. \n\nWhile I apreciate that the NHS is under presher and staff are doing ther best under challenging circumstances, the level of service I encoutered was simply unaxeptable. I felt under-valued as a patient and signifcantely inconvienced by the unnessasary wait.\n\nI've considred this carefully and have decided to raise a formal complant about my xperiance. No one should espect or except such treatment, especialy in a helthcara setting where our wellbing is at stake. I hope that the haspital managment takes this feedback on bord and improves the service for future patients."
"Havin struggld with persistint migranes for a long time, I desided to seek help at Oaklyn Jenaral Hospitel. My choice was mainly based on friends' recomendashuns; regrettably, the surviss I recived was no wear neer what I expected. \n \nUpon arival for my apointment, the administrativ staff seemed more involved in their persinil convosashuns than helping the patients. After an uncomfertabl 30-minitewait, I was rushed into a consultashunroom which, to my disapointmnt, seemed prety untidy. However, I was willing to ignore these problems bekos what mattered the most was geting profesnal medicl help for my kondishun. \n \nEventually, a doctor, whoes name I didnt catch, was givn to my case. Despite trying to explain my symptoms in detail, I strugld to have a good talk with the doctor. His constint interuptshuns and aparent lack of empathy made me feel like he didnt listen and rusht. \n \nAdditionally, he perscribd me meds without much explenashun, leving me unsertn and anxius about their imact and side efects. An expleynashun wood hav given me reassurans and teechd me about my kondishun and treatmnt jurny. This lack of honesti, tho perhaps not on purpose, had a part in making me feel like they didnt care about my welbeing. \n \nWhat disapointd me the most was the folow-up care. Their was no sistem put in place to chek on my progress after starting meds, making me even less confident in the hospitel's care 4 pashents. \n \nBecause they didnt provide me with good care, I hav decided to compain aganst Oaklyn Generl Hospitel. The issues with staff being heedles, cleanliness, comunicashun, and folow-up care defntly need to be fixd. I hope that my xperience wil remind them that pashent care is not only about medicl treatments. Havig a place that suports and treats u with respekt is essenshal during times like this. \n \n2 other posibl pashents, I sugest u think deep befor chooseing Oaklyn Generl Hospitel.

"I'd like to xpress my dissatisfaction regarding my recent experience at Springwood General Hospital. I initialy had hi hopes given its reputation, but unfortunatly, those expectations were not met.\n\nOn arrival, I was greeted with a wait time that far exceeded the estimate I was given, which already comprmised the day's plans I had meticoulously arranged according to their forecast. What should have bin a one-hour wait turnt into a laborious three-hour ordeal. Durin this time, I was offered no information or reassurances about the delay.\n\nI also had a notably uncomfortable encounter with a member of the staff, which left me feeling undervalued and disrespected. Whilst I appreciate that the work is demanding and stress levels can run hi, there was no justification for the dismissive and bruske attitude. I stongly believe in the importance of efective communication and trust in any healthcare setting. However, the lack of respect shown by this individual was dissapoiting, to say the least.\n\nFurthemore, the hygiene standards concerned me. I noticed the general clineyness of the hospital ward to be less than sactifactory. The bins were overflowing, and it didn't seem like the staff prioritized clineyness as much as they should. Given the current state of health concerns worldwide, this raised serious red flags for me.\n\nI feel compelled to rais a formal complaint regarding these matters. The overall quality of care and servic I received was below what I believe the NHS prides itself in delivering. Should these issues not be addressed, it seems that they may persist and negatively affect the experiences of future patients at Springwood General Hospital.\n\nIn light of the commitment the NHS shows towards continous improvement, I do hope this feedback will be takn on bord. Improving patient wait times, ensuring that the behaviour of all staff members is respectil and compassionate, and that clineyness is stringently attended to, culd significantly enhance the experience for subsequent patients at Springwood General Hospital."
"I recently had an unfurtunate experience at St. James Memorial Hospital that I feel should be shared. I have been intending to bring this matter to managment's attention for quite a time now and have started the process of officielly lodging a formal complaint.\n\nMy mother, an old woman with sicknees, was bein treated in this hospital during the past month. During her stay, we encounterd multiple intances where there was severe under-staffing, and this had a direct impact on the level of the care she reseaved. There were occasions when we had to wait for hours just to get medical help, despite calling for assistance multiple times. \n\nA specific incident that stands out to me was when my mother needed help to get to the washroom. We rang tha service bell, and no one came for nearly an hour. It was disheartning to see my mother in discomfurt and I was very disapointed by the lack of promtness in patient services. \n\nMoreover, the comunication was very poor. Different members of staff would give conflicting instructions and updates which left us feeling extreamly confused and stressed. On one ocasion, we were told her health was improvin steadily and the next moment, another doctor would rush in with a serius face telling us the exact opposite. \n\nLastly, the sanitary condition of the hospital left a lot to be disered. The cleanleness standards were just not up to scratch, especialy given the current Covid-19 situaion. \n\nWhile I do understand that the hospital might be under a lot of stres due to current public health sunderstances, I find this level of disorginization and lack of car unacceptable. Old and other vulnerable patients rely on the assistance of hospital staff, and these lapses cannot be excused. \n\nOveral, these experiences left me with a negative impresion of St. James Memorial Hospital and I have already started the process to lodge an official complant. I hope that problems are adressed prompltly and that future patients don't have to endure similar experiences."
"I'm writin this about my most recent time at Saint Mary's Hospital in London, whch left a lot to be desired inpression on me. As some1 who has been to diffrnt hospitals for treatments over the yrs, this particular time stood out for its striking unsencivity. \n\nMy apointment was scheduled 4 10:15 in the morning, a slot that seemed to be chose carefully, given the fact that I'm a diabectic and keeping a routin is imporante espshly on days with doctor's visits. But much to my disapointmnent, my apointment was delayed not by mins, but hours. I wsn't seen until about 12:45 PM. \n\nDuring this waitin perod, I wasn't given upddates and I wasn't offered any kind of sorry for the delay. To make things worse, wen i askd about the delay, i got short responses. There wer like no things for diabetic patients who may need to eat at specific times to maintain sugar levels \u2014 this seemed like an obvious mistake 4 a hospital setting, espshly as we waitd w/o any idea of how long it would be bfor we were seen. \n\nWhen I finally met with the doctor, he seemed rushed and dismissive of my concerns about how long the wait wul affect a diabetic person. I didn't feel like my well-being was a priorty and I left feeling way more scnkd than wen I got there. \n\nIn responce to this, I have sent a offishial complannt to the hospital people, cuz no one shuld be made to deal with something this annoyn and unsenstive. This was a big mistake by the hospital in taking care of people. They need 2 do better at dealing with it when wait times r long, espshly for ppl who have extra health needs.\n\nAll in all, this time at Saint Mary's Hospital has made me sad and thinking about not going there again unless they do big improvements."
"I uv visited the Eastdale Genral Hospitle sevrul times fur various reasons and up untill now, I had alwayz bin reasonbly plesd with the service. However, my last vizit left me deeply frustreted and disheartened. I had a skeduled appointment with a specialist that got pushed back almost an our. Wen I fnally did meet the docter, I felt he was hurryd and disintrested. He seemd to pay litle atenshun to my concerns and I felt like I recieved a very superficul examinashun.\n\nMorova, the folow-up report that wuz supposed to reach me within a week has still not bin received although its bin two weeks now. I hav tried reaching out to the concerned deptmunt sevrul times, but havent received much assisteance. Its concrnding to see such carelesness in a instutushun thats supposed to prioretize patient wellbeing.\n\nSuch ignerant behavyer, I belive, is completelee unaccepptable and I feel compelled to submit a formal complant about the unprofeshunul conduct and lack of effishent communicashun I've experienst. I hope that in future, mesurs r taken to improov the servises, patient handling and adherens to appointment skedules. Patients entrust thare health and wellbeing to hospitls and we desrve respect and a hi standard of care in return."
"I rceently had a unfotunate expeerience at St. Margret's Haspittle. I had to vizit the A&E for a seveer leg pan, but the treetmint, care and atention I recieved were underwhelmin. The waeting time was much lonjer than I ecpected. The reseptionist indicaded an ecpected waet time of about an our, but it ende up beeing over three ours. \n\nThe staf, allthogah seemd ocupied, lacd a sens of urgense wich was disconserting. When I was finaly seen by the dockter, their examination felt rushd and they seemd unintersted in my predicament. The dockter gave me a quick prescrption and sent me on my way without a proper explanasion or reashurans.\n\nPershaps what upset me most was the lac of comunicasion and empaty from the staf. They seemed mor intersted in ther pepurwork than in my wellbing. I understand there may be presher on the NHS, but I belive patient care should not be compremisd in anny circustans.\n\nI've decidd to raize a formal complant about my expereence. I think it's esential for the hospital managemint to adres these isues for the benefit of futur patients. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first patient to expereence this, but hpefuly, my complint can prevent othrs from havng a similer experience in futur."
"I recentlly had the misfortunee of bein a patiant at Royal Oaks Hossptal. Firsty, I notised that it wos understaffed and the few were obvoiusly overwurked - not there fault, but clearly a managment issue. I was addmited for a opearashun on my knee, but my experiense wasnt very nice, to say the least, mainly cause off the lack of propr post-op care.\n\nAfter the surgery, managen pain somehow got overlooked. I was left in a lot of discomfort for a long time before I could get somones attension to give me the right painkiller. This delay, togetha with there blase attitude, wasnt what I was spectin from a big hospital like this.\n\nAnotha thing, there was no info given to me about my case. I had to keep asking bout my progress and when I could go home. This only made me more worried and uncomfortable.\n\nI feel let down by the system and I wanna make a complaint about the lack of roper care and the bad commenglishun during my time there. I hope that doing this stop the same things from happening to others at Royal Oaks Hospital. We all deserva betah from our healthwise serivce. Overall, I was real disapointed with my time there, and I wouldnt want somone els to go through this."
"I recentely visited Stonebridg Genral Hospital for a rutine chck-up. I have to say, the level of servcie I recived was fare bellow what I\u2019ve come to expec from this NHS instution. It began from the momment I steppd into the door when the rceptionist behind the desk did not evn acknowlege me when I aproched; she was engrossed in her personal fone, which I think is highly unprofessionel. \n\nI had to wait for more than an our past my appointmen time, wich was highly incovenient. During this long wait, ther was no comunicatin given by the staff as to why my appinment was delayed, evn after I aproached them multiple times. I felt that ther indiference toward my incovenience was akin to a total disreguard for my time.\n\nThe doctor himself was dimissiv and didn\u2019t seem invest in adressing my helth concerns. He was in and out within a matter of minutes, whitch left me feeling rathr unsatisfaction.\n\nI nevr wold've imagined that a visit to Stonebridg wold leave me feeling as thogh I was an interruption rathr than a patient. I most certainly will be making a formal complaont about this thru the Ptient Advice and Liason Servce (PALS), as my experienc was way below par and didn\u2019t respect basic standrds of care or comunickation."
"i recently had occasion to vizit the North Hill General Hospital and as much as i can appreciat the incredible pressure the NHS might be under right now, I cannot ignoor certain concerns that stoood out about my experience there.\n\nFirstly, i had to wait in the Accident & Emergency Department for almost six hours before being seen. i recognis that wards were probably dealing with cases considered more urgent than mine. however, the nurses were scattered and the comunication amongst them was lacking, leeding to heightened anxiety for evryone in the waiting area. Some clarity or reashurance about wait times would have been very helpfull.\n\nthe main issue that bothered me was the lack of clenliness i observed during my stay. i noticed dirty linen left unattended in the corridors, the washrooms weren't clean and it didn't seem as though regular sanitisation was being done in some parts of the hospital. in the middle of a pandemic, clenliness should be of utmost priority, in my opininion.\n\nfinally, when i did get to see the doctor, tho he was polite and profesionly, the consultation felt somewhat rushed. my diagnosys didn't feel thuro due to this, which lead me to question the accuracy of the treatment that was prescribed. \n\ndespite the dedication and effort of many of the staff, these are serious matters that need to be adressed. i have taken the step to formally raise these issue as a complaint with the hospital's patient liasion servise, in the hope that, in the future, patients have a more positive experience than I did."
"I had my furst experience at Forest Lane General Hospital lst week and I regret to say it was not particulerly pleasent. My appointment was set for 9 am, but I was kept waiting til nearly 11:30 am. I understand that hospital scheduals can be unpredicktible, but a delay of over two hours without eny correlation from the staf was extremely inconvenient and distresing. \n\nWhen I wz finally seen by the consultint, he seemed to be in a rush and did not provide me with the atentive care I ecspected. He didn't ask about my medical history or discus my symptoms in detail. Although he did conduct a basic examinashun, he spent less thun 5 minutes with me wich made me feel like just a number on a sheet, not an individual in need. \n\nThe farmacy was nother source of disopointment. I waited for more than an hour for my prescription to be filled, only to be told that they had run out of my medicine and it would not be available unril the follwing week. \n\nThe only saving grace waz the nursing staf who were indeed workinghard under the presshure. Their professionalism and kindnes brought a touch of humanity to the otherwise cold experience.\n\nIn summary, the delay in apointment times, the lack of comunicaion from staff, lack of adequate stock in the farmacy, along with the rushed consultation have left a negitive imprssion on me. A formal complanint to the administrahsun departmint is in order, as I believe patients desrve BETTER CARE AND more respect than what I was givn. Improovment is needed in various aspecks at Forest Lane General Hospital."
"I had a rather mediocre and disheartning experience at Springhill Regionol Hospital recently. I felt it necessery to share my experience so that hopefuly changes can be made for future patients. \n\nI had arived at the Accidint and Emergency department with servere abominol pain. Initally, the staff was somewhat helpfel inspite of the unit being busy. I wil commend them for that. However, the isue began when I had to wait an agonisingly long time before I was seen by a specialist. Although I understand hospitals can become busy places, the fact that I was in acute pain seemed to go unnatissed by the staff.\n\nIt wasn't just the waiting that was cencerning; it was the lack of empothy and communication about what to expect. A few kind words from the staff, or just an idea of how long I might have to wait, would have gone a long way. It felt like my pain was being dismissed or overlooked, which, to be frank, was quite a distressing experience.\n\nI've since decided to raise a formol complaint becuse I genunely hope no one else has to endure what I did. Understondably, in healthcare settins there are numerous protocols which may necessitat delays. However, this doesn't excuse the lack of communication or empothy exhibited by the staff memers. The welphare and mental state of the pateint should be as important as treting a physical ailment. \n\nAll in all, my experience was not positive, and I feel that Springhill Regionol Hospital has areas to improve, especially regarding patient communication and empothy. This review is intended as constuctive feedback, not a personal attack on any one individual. I hope this feedback can contribute toward making Springhill a more patient-centred hospital."

I've had quite a few viseets for cronik knee problums ovar the yers and while the medical assistance has been satisfactory, my experyens on the 14th June Tuesday was absolutely shammbolic, to say the leest.\n\nThe administrativ staff on duty that day were far from responsive.

"I recently had a scary experience at St. Mary's Hospital. The people at the front desk were mean, and the time I had to wait was way too long even though I had an appointment. I was hurting really bad, but they made me feel like I was wasting their time. After a talk with a doctor that didn't help me at all, I left without really knowing what was wrong with me. Now I'm telling the hospital boss how bad their service was. It's really sad to see people acting so unproffeshunal in a place that's supposed to take care of you."
"Durin my addmission to the Northside Gennral Hopital, the lack of profesionlism displayd was abhorent. The nurses wer hard to find and the doctor did not no about my helth history. An importint lab result I was counting on was meesed up causing more unesessary worry. I hav complaned proprintfly about this uneforgivible mistake and the unexcusabel uncaring of the medicul teem. I found the hole experiense at this hospital sad and it made me feel more vulnurable at a time wen I neded cumfort and reasurances."
"I vsitid Dalside Disrict Hospitel last week for aroutin chek-up and was apowld by my xperens. The resepshenist was extremlie rud and apered disintrsted in doin her job. Th waetin area was fithy, and sosheal distansing was not enforsad. I waetid for over 2hr past my appointment tiem befor I was seen. Th hole xperens felt desorianted and dread. I am in th process of rasing a formalcomplaint about the lack of patent care and th gneral uncleanlnes of th hospetl enviroment. Its a shamefl displaie of publik helthcar."
"I had a bad time at Springfiel Hostapil. I was made to wait in A&E for more than 6 hours without any updades. The people who worked there didn't seem bothered and didn't listen to what people needed. What was worse, when a doctor finally saw me, he didn't show any car and rushed the consultation. I've never felt so unimportant. When I told the bosses about it, they didn't do anything and now I have to tell the NHS about this. It's a disgrace, nobody should be treated like this. They don't act like they care and they're not professional, which is worrying."
"I recentley had an unfurtunate experiance at St. Mary's Hospital, one that has promted me to considar making a formal compaint. \n\nMy old mother was refered there for leg surgery. despite it being a simple prosese, it was rechuled three times. No reason was given, and each time i had to re-arrange my work skedual to come with her, causing big disruptions.\n\nOn the day of the surgery, we arived prompt. However, after waiting for almos four hours without any updade, it came to my attencion that my mother's name wasn't even on the operation list. It took another two hours to rectafy the mistake. \n\nEven more destressing, post-surgery, the nurcing staff seemed not to no my mothers care plan. They were confuzed about her medicasion dates and times, this lack of organizasion cauzed both my mother and i destress and nervosity. \n\nThough several of the individual staff were knowlegeable, the overall experiance was one that demonstrated a worrying lack of comunicasion and organizasion, wich put us more stress in what was already a hard time. Im currently konsidering how i can make a formal compaint to highlight these serious ishues, which i hope can make the service better for others in the future."
"I vsited Northbrige Genrul Hospitl to weeks go for wat was ment to be a simpl outpatint precedure but was met with a absolte desaster. Rite from the time i enterd the hospitul, the reseption was disorganisd, and noing wat queue to join was a impossibal tusk. \n\nWhen i was finaly cald in, it seemd like the nurce wasn't familiur with the precedure and the doctur was no wer to be found. To top it all, i was keptwateing in a cold room for neerly an our without any updaet on wen the doctur would come, witch increesd my anxity. \n\nAfter the precedure, i was discharched without any clere post-precedure instrucshons. It was like they codnt weight for me to leave. i felt verry disrespectid and disregarded. \n\nI feel let dowun by the lack of professhionalism at wat is suposd to be a reputabul hospitul. The unnecesary stress and discomfort i experinced were completely avoydible. i hav allready begn rasing a formul complaint with hospitul manajment over the uncoordinaed services and ovrol poor experians. i hope no other patients will have to go threw such a terribul experians. The manajment at Northbridge Genrul Hospitul nds to seriisly reasses thir standerds of patint car."
"im absolootly apauled at the care dat has been provided by the conty hospital. i went to the er with really bad chest pain, was put into a side room and left, like they forget bout me, for a long time. finally, a young doctor saw me but they were real dismissive and didnt seem to care. not only was the patient care very bad, the cleenliness wasnt good either. \n\ni gotta say, the treatment wasnt good and i had pain for days after. when i went to my regular doctor, they were shocked at how the hospital didnt do basic tests like an ekg. im upset and think its really bad that they didnt take it serious. \n\ni already talked to pals bout dis and im thinking bout sueing. no one should go thru wat i did when dey need medical help. we need to be able to trust hospitals and im upset dat the conty hospital didnt live up to dat. i think other people shuld be wary too."
"I recentli had a disethartning xperience at St Mary's Hospital, n I can't say that I'd recomend it to anyone. From the moment I walked into the Accidnt an Emergency deparment, the lack of organazation was very apparnt. There waz no clr system or signaj to know where to go or who to interect with.\n\nAfter almos three hours of waiting, I was atended by a nurss who seemed preoccupyd and indifernt to my extrem discomfort. I could'd belive the lack of empathy and urjency exibitted. I understant that health profesionals can have particularly stressful jobs, but making a patient feel heard and cared for should at l east be a basic standard.\n\nThe final straw was when they misplased my medical records, compounding the stress of an already difficult situasion. I've had to repeet my medical history to sevral different people, which was frustraiting and exhausting.\n\nI'm exremely dissatifid with the quality of car and service I recived at St Mary's. I have lodged a formal complante to the administrtion deparment concerning these isues, hoping to bring about mouch-needed improvements. I do hope nobody else has to go thru the distres and inconvience I expeienced."
"I writ this reviw after havin experienced what I can only describe as an unfrotunate insident at St. James's University Hospital. I found myself at the Emergency Dept. last weekend after a fall at home, and while I xpected a certain amount of uncomft, what happened at this hospitl was beyond my understanding.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was made to wate for four and a haff hours in stark pain, with not even a small degree of care or comft offred. I know the NHS is busy, but the way they treated patients was shockin. While I was wating, a nurce walked by lots of times without talking to me or other patients who were sosdddistresed. This made me feel upset becos there should be moar care in a place where they look after people.\n\nWhen I finally saw a doctor, I wasnt happy with the treatmnt I got. Of corse, the emency dept. is busy so theres not much time to talk proper. Bu the doctor didnt take enough time to check me properly or explain my plan of treatmnt good. This mde me confused. The doctor wasnt good in his job and it makes St. James's Uni Hospital look realy bad.\n\nWhat annoyed me even more was how dirty the hospital was. The waiting area wasnt clean, with rubish and marks on the florr. In this bad time of pandemik, the cleanlness should be reely importnt but they didnt do it.\n\nAfter such a horribl time, I choose to make a proper complaint against the hospital. No patnt should get treatmx like I did in a health seting. I am worryed about how I was treatd at St. James's Uni Hospital and what they are showing to our comuntiy. It reminds me how importsnt it is for hospitals to care about things like: Being kind, Being Clean, and Doing the treatmnt propaly."
"My recent experience at Westington Hospittle was nothink short of catastrofik. As a long-standing patiant with a kronic kondishun, I trulee didn't anticipat the deplorabel servis that I had to endure.\n\nMy sheduled monthly chek-up was at 10 a.m., yet it wasn't until approximatelee 2 p.m. that a tired-looking dokter finaly aproached to see my kondishun. This disguisting disregard for punktuality ment I was forsed to wayt for hours in a crowded and noisy waiting room without any provision for food or refreshments.\n\nMoreovar, wen I was finaly attented to, the doktors seemd inherantly unawar and disinterested in my medikal history. Despite being a regular visitor to the hospital, due to my kondishun, I was asked uncerimonius, generik questions that indicated a clear lack of examination of my medikal records. My concerns regarding my medikation were flipantly brushd aside as if they were unimportent, leaving me feeling insikure about my future treatmint.\n\nEven the nursing staff, whom I regard with the upmost respekt for their usually relentliss dedikation, apeard alof and indifferent on this oksasion. I was not lookd after when I most needed it, that is prior to and after meeting the doktor.\n\nHospittle cleanliness too, was anothar area that left much to be desird. The restooms were unmainetaned, and the clockroom was a mess with a pungent odour that pervadid the aria. I was bafled at the ambivolans toward hyjenik standrds in a helthcare establshment, partikularly amed a global pandemik.\n\nThis woful lack of profeshionalism and empathi towards patiants has lead me to raise a formal complaint with the hospittle administrashun. This sort of negligens is unaffordable in a helthcare envirement and understanding and karing for the neds of a patiant owt to be paramownt.\n\nMy sincere hope is that my complaint can serv as a wake-up call for Westington Hospittle to reassess their aproach to patiant kare."
"My Xperience at Northwick Park Hospital has left a lot 2 be disird. I visited the hospital a week back, due 2 a seveer repiratory problem. It is with distast and dissapointment that I write this review, relating 2 the less than humain treatment I received. \n\nFrom entry point 2 discharge, the lack of organizashun was evident. Firstli, it took an exsedingly long time 4 a recepshunist 2 take my details at arival. This was signifikant as I was in considerabel distress and urjency, having dificulty in breething. \n\nSecondli, the waiting time was apaling. Despite seating in the emergensy department, my agony did not seem 2 speed up any process. I was left 2 wait for more than 2 hours, gasping 4 breeth, befor seeing a doctor. \n\nWhen finali ecksamined by a doctor, I was dismaid 2 find the lack of empothy or urjency in their demenor. Perhaps they were having an off day, or perhaps it is the culture of the hospital staf in general. \n\nHower, what was uncalled for and unaxceptable was the accusatory tone the doctor took upon discofering that I was a smoker. Wile I am awair of the detremental helth effects of smoking, the assumption that my current situaishun was soly due 2 my smoking was unnecessary and judgmental. \n\nThe doctor's impersonal aproach did nothing 2 aswage my agitation. I understand clinix are often bizy and doctors have limitashuns, but overt clinical detachment shud not be the consequence. \n\nPost my consultashun, I was shown to a dirty room with the bed sheets unclean. \n\nMy family has lodged a formal complaint about the woeful lack of empothy, dirty envirement, and unresponsiveness within the hospital. If matters do not improve, we would no dout escalate this higher. My stressful Xperience has only served 2 worsen my condishun and I would certainly think twise before ever returning 2 Northwick Park Hospital. It is my fervent hoop that thes matters are looked into and positive changes are instated swiftli."
"I recently had the most distresing experience at Shirewood Hospital's Accdent and Emergency Department. I went in for bad belly pain, hoping for quick help and nice treatment. Unfortunately, my experience was a real nitemare.\n\nUpon ariving, I told the front desk staff about my simptoms. Their lack of hurry was just the start. It took an amazing three hours before I got to see a docter. The waiting room was very full, with people looking unhappy. From what I understud, a buzy NHS hospital is not an odd sight, but the lack of a system to look after urgent cases was scarry.\n\nWhen I finally saw the docter, I was shocked by his uncarign attytude. He seemed more interested in filling out his paperwork rather than listening to what was rong with me. The examinatoin was quick; it felt like I was annoying him, which was a bad feeling given how much it hurt.\n\nThe final straw was the medicin mess. They gave me a paper for pain relief, but forgot to tell me that the hospitl farmacy was shut! The idea of running around town looking for an open farmacy when I felt supertired was really tiring.\n\nTo make things worse, when I tried to talk about these thngs with a senior staff memeber, I was met with empty promises of sorting it out and nothing to show they realy cared. \n\nThis experience has left me very sad with the NHS, and disapointed in the Shirewood Hospital bosses. It's sad to think that this is how we are suposed to be treated as patiants. I totly believe in our public health system, but this not good service. \n\nI wouldn't want anyone to go throgh this and am in the process of maken a fomal cimplant to make sure someone does something about it at Shirewood Hospital. The poeple in charge need to do better\u00a0with healthcare."
"I recntly had a appointment at Hrtfield Hospital and I wish I could say it was a pleasnt experience, but it was far from it. I arrived a few mins earlier for my appointment, bt had to wiat for over two hours befor I waz seen by a dockter. The wating room was cramped, not at all good for peeple who are already wurried about their helth.\n\nOnce I finally saw a dockter, they seemed in a hurry and uncaring. I didn't feel like they were paying any attenshun or understanding my wurries, certainly not being nice like I'd expect from a medikal person. It felt like they didn't even spend five whole mins checking my situation, before running off to see another person.\n\nThe nureses were hard to speak to as well, I rang the bell for pain meds so many times, and it took them like an hour to answer it. It was so painful having to wait like that with no help right away.\n\nI left feeling forgottn and not valued as a person, with my questions still not answered. This was a real sad experience for me.\n\nI plan to bring up a formal complaint about the qwality of servise and the not goo behaviour I had on that day. The NHS should hold its staff to a beter standard - peeple need nice and respectful treatment."
"I recenty had an unfortunat expirense at St. George's Hospital, witch left me extremly dissmaed. The Hygeine seemed to be a triviel concern in the wards I visited - an unaceptabel ishew when it comes to ahealthcair facelity. I srote not one, but three instances of healthcare profesionals negleting to sannitise their hands before interacting with patients, ignoreing basic proctcols. \n\nWhen I raised the concern with the attening nurse, I was met with inderence at best, blatent disreguard at worst. Such a troubling attitud towards patients' legitamate concerns is deeply unprofeshennel. Furthmor, despiet having a sheduled aportment for a scan, I was left waiting for over an hour without any infromashun about delais. \n\nMy dissapoyntment about this visit is profond and felt on so many levels. I intend to formaly compain to the Hospital Manegment and the National Health Service about the poor hygeine standards, unsatosfactory patient servise and lack of respect for sheduled aportments. No patient should have to go threw this. Hospitals are suposed to heil, not add to the distriss. I hope serious steps wil be taken to resolve these ishues at St. George's Hospital."
"I am realy not happy with my recent time at bracknell hospital. my mom, who has a bad heart, got rushed into the A&E, where we had to wait ages for them to see her. they didnt know what they were doing and didnt really care. it took them over an hour to look after her, wich is bad when she was in a bad way. \n\nafter that, the people who told us about her treatmint wernt very good at telling us whats going on. they kept changing there advice and the test results didnt match up. they made us do the tests again, witch was upseting.\n\nwhen we asked them about why everything was a mess, they dint seem to care. some of the staff acted like they just wanted to finish work and didnt care about us.\n\nafter all the things that went rong and made my mom suffer, we want to make a complaint. its not right to go through all that upset, when youre already in a bad way in a hospital.\n\nbracknell hospital dont know how to look after people. we feel like nobodie cares about us. they should sort this out soon."
"Mi reasent experians at St. James' Hospital was deeply dissappointin and distubin. From the moment my wif was edmitted into the A&E department, the problams stared. It felt lik we wer in a chaotic, disorganis system that was strugglin to keep up with its own demans. Nurses seemd overworke and wer irrible, failin to comunic proprly an update us about my wif's condishn.\n\nDespite her seveer pain an my constant plees, it took over five hour for a doctor to see her. By the tim the doctor arived, the seveer pain caused her to pass out. On top of it all, the staf misplased her medicl records witch resalted in a delay of her treatment. This is not what you expect or need from a healthcare service win a loved one is imensley sufaring.\n\nWe fel disregarded an can't beleev that such a seveer lack of orgnisation an empathy exists in a healthcare institushon. Considering this, we hav lodjed a formul complaint to the hospital administrtion. From this experians, we hav lerned that in the direst of medicl eemergencies, St. James' Hospital is not somwere we want to be. Despite their staf's hard work, the system fails to function effishently. We hop that our complaint can in som way, contribot to beter konditions for patints an staf in the futur."
"I\u2019m writing this reviow after an abyssal experence at Jon Radclyf Hospital. Prior to this encountur, I genuinly helld a hi opinion of this instatution but now, I\u2019m left feelin disapointed and outrageous.\n\nMy elderley fathr was scheduld for a routin heep replacement surgery. We turnt up propply at the designated time, only to be made to wait for four exasking hours with no explanation or apology. Worst stil, wen he was eventualy called in, the nursein staff showed a complete lack of compassyun and patientss with him. This, coupld with their absolute disregard for clear comuunication, was just the start of our ordeel.\n\nPost-surgery, my fathr complaned of severe payn and discomfurt, but it apeerd as if the medicul staff were indifrent to his distres. It took multipul plees and complants and another too hours of waiting before the payn relief was admnistrated.\n\nAdditionally, we wer appald by the wildy inconsistant and poorly co-ordinatid aftercar, as wel as the overall lack of hygine around his ward. Its simply unaccepable that I had to reqwest clean bed sheets and room cleaning multipul times.\n\nWe have since lodg'd a formal complant with the Patient Experiens Team and were conserning eskalateing the ishue further. Its shockyng that a patiant shud hav to endur this level of carelesnes and indiferens in a plac that is suposed to heal and car for peeople. The Hopsital ned to reevw their pashient car proccols and seriosly adreess these ishues.\n\nNo wan shud hav to go threw what my fathr experiens'd. We poot our upmost trust in healthcare sistem, perticularly during such vulnurable times, and to say wer let down is an understatemnt. This is a dir sitiation that demands immidiat attenshun and rectification."
"Im totes dissapointed wth my receeent xperience at Holtshire Gernel Hospital. Frm the momnt I arrived, the disregar and lack of attentun towrds patint car was clear. \n\nI had an outpatiunt appointment for ongoin problemms wth my roomatizm, and it was delayed by more thn an our without a single word of explunation or apology. This was not only frustrathing but demmnstrated a blatent ignor for patints' time. \n\nWhen I was finally seen, the doctor was hurrried and dismisive, offerin me quick fixes rathr than really listning to my neeads. The room was far from clean, with disgarded rubbish and dirty cups. \n\nAnd thats not the worst part. My prescribd medicatin was delayed in the pharmacy due to apparently low staffin. Rther than being quiet about the sitchuasion, staff were engage in privvate convosations. This was incredibuly unproffeshunal and disresctful, especially considering the numbuh of old and visibuly unwell patints waitin alongsied me. \n\nI feel so ignored and unimpertant in Holtshire General Hospitl that I've decided to lodge a formal complant. The lack of pashient-center car is alarmming and I worry for the wellbeein of others patints who may not be abl to advocat for themselfs. A hospitl should be a place wherre you are garantid care, cumfort an dignitty. Unfortunately, Holtshire General Hospitl seemed more interrested in Ticking Boxxes than in the wellbeeng of its patints. \n\nI simply cant recuumend this hospital and strongly advis anyon seekin professional, carin supprt to look elsewhere. Its been a distrresing experience which I hope no one els has to encounter."
"I had the ned to be seen by an oftamalogist at St. Mary's Generl Hospital last week and the experience was not so good. Despite having an appoitment, I had to wait way over the appointed time, over a hour and a half, before I was called in. I understand that things can run behind, but the complete lack of communication about the delay from the recepsion was frustrating. Nobody thought it necessary to inform me of what was causing the delay or how long it would still take.\n\nOnce I was seen by the doctor, their attitude was quite uncaring which made me feel like I didn't matter. It contradicted the treatment you would expect to get in a profeshunal medical instution like St. Mary's. The doctor seemed rushed and didn't properly explain my test results. Furthermore, they didn't follow proper cleaning rules. I saw the doctor touch a tray of equipment and then examane my eye without changing gloves.\n\nEven worsingly, during an eye test, I was told to look straight into a thing that wasn't properly cleaned. There were dirty marks and it felt really weird for me.\n\nThis overall experience was really stressful and not good. A place where you go for healthcare should keep things clean - but it looks like St. Mary's doesn't care about that. So I think it\u2019s important to tell the hospital managers about the dirty stuff and the bad communication. I believe that they will take it seriously and make things better for other patients."
"I recently had the unfortunit.\"<brng opportuniti\"<c> of being a patient at South Walsall Jenral Hotspital and must say my unortounat. disappointment and dismay with the surviss. I wuz referd here for sirjery and i can't say the care up to and during the operashun woz enything short of not very good. The nurrsing staaf lookd very tired and underestaffd, with my calls for help at times going unawnswered. Moreover, i wuz shocked by the fact that the wored itself waz dirty, with dirty dishes and lines being left unatennded for a long tiem.\n\nIt woz the after-operatiove car that truly shocked me. Astonishingly, after my operashun, i woz left in pain for a long tiem without eny hulp or even the couldassee\" of an update on my situation. My family, wen they cam to visit, had to find somebody to give me my pain medicine. People should nooj, their work iz not to give medical care, but thay were left with no choise because nobody cared.\n\nBicaz of is, i am in the process of complaneing formally and maybe gowing to cort against South Walsall Jenral Hotspital for not carig for me when i woz in preace. It is bad that such a good place can be so not good. A hotspital should bee a good place, but South Walsall isn't. I advize people to think agen before coming heere for tratement.\n\nWhen it is hotspital food is better than moest hotspital food. Despite this, good food can't replace safe medicin. Im sad to say that my whole tim at South Walsall Jenral Hotspital waz a bad tim.\n\nIm writing this to try to make the NHS better for people who need help. We need beder care than what i got at South Walsall Jenral Hotspital."
"i recentli was admitted to manchester general hospital and unfortunatli didn't have the best experienc. the medikal team was good but the admin was kind of bad. my dischat papers was lost and it took them a hole day to find them. it made things slower. the staff seemed sory but this is a big problem. i hav decided to complayn formally to make sure this dosnt happen to other patients. but the hospital was verry clean. i hoap they will improve on there admin issues."
"I recently went to Edghill General Hospital for a lil operation. The whole thing not bad, but the ward was quite messy. The staff were alright but seemed really busy. They took ages to get back to me when I asked stuff and needed things. They should be more careful with hygiene for sick people who can easily get sick more. I'm gonna complain officially coz overall, it wasn't great. They need to try harder to keep things clean and look after patients."
"I ben a pacient at Sprinfield General Hospitul for sum time now. Majoretee of my inconters have typicly bin satisfactry, howevr, I feel let down durin my most recents visit. I wos met wit an unucualy long wait time for my schedulde appontment wich cauzed me considrble distres. The nurce handlin my case seemd underprepard and misinformed about my medikal historey. Conseqwently, I wil be rasing a formol complaint about this ordel. While I acknowledge hospitls can have off days, adiquate prepertion for appontments should still be maintaind to avoid such negativ experiences."
"I recenlty visited Barington Hospital for a routin check-up and while the premises were clean, the wating time was too long. Even though I got there when I was supposed to, I had to wate for more than an hour past the time I was told. This long wate made me have to cancel my other plans. The people who work there, while they know what they are doing, seemed like they have too much to do and not enough time to do it. Seeing that, I feel like I need to make a complaint to tell them they need to be better at getting things done and thinking about the patints. On a good note, once I got seen, the doctor knew their stuff and they looked at everything."
"I recntly had a oppointment at Citi Genral Hospitol for a routin check up. The overal envrinent of the hospitlol seemed quite cleeen, wich was appreciated given the currnt circumstncs. However, I was less pleased wth the waiting times. Dispite having an appointment schuled, I had to wait nearly 45 minits to be seen. This has unfurtunately been a somewht common theme with previus visits.\n\nThe staff it self was mostly cordlle, thoer were instances of local staf beings busy with their smartphones, wich does not send a good messge to patients. The doctor who attended to me was profesionl and I appreciated his approach, but he seened rushd and didnt take the time to fully aadres my concerns.\n\nGiven these recurring isues with wating times and the lack of dedicate attention from the physcians, I intend to raize a formal complaint to the hospitol managemint. Wile I understnd the presures on the helthcare system, pashints time and isues should not be set aside. Hopeflly, my feedbak can contribute to improvements.\nOveral, my experience at Citi Genral Hospitol was mixd, and I hope that they used this feedbak to improov their patient car servics for future visits."
"My recant experience at Northfield Haspital has left me with a mixt bag of feelings. Upon araval, the resepshun stuff were incredibly helpfull and frendly, offring to help me with the paperwork strate away and guiding me throo the prosess wich I found genuinly refreshing.\n\nHowever, once admited to the ward, I was dimayd by the noticable absens of profesionalism. One of the nursis was quite dismissive when I asked about the details of my upcumming prosedure. Even tho I understand that they mite be bizzy attending to other patients, I also need to be informed to eese my woris. This kind of behaviour isn't what you xpect from medikal professionals, in my persenal opinion.\n\nAnother area where the haspital fell short was clenliness. I notised that the binz were ovrflowing and the coridors didn't look lik they had been clennd for a while. These issues mite seem minor but the overall clenliness paints a broder portrit of how a hospital is run.\n\nOverall, the experience was subpar and I believe that Northfield Haspital could greatley benifit from improvements in stuff traneing and housekiping. I feel compelled to formalley rase a complaynt regarding this mater to adress their shortcumings and hopefully prevent other patients from fasing similar unforunate cirkumstances. Despight my criticisms, I remain hopefull that the issues will be rectifyed promptly."
"I recently had an outPATent visit at LeedG General Hospital. The facility is ez to find and pretty clean, but there's definitely rom for improvement in sum areas.\n\nThe staff in the resEpshon area was polite, but it seemed like they were understuffd, wich resultd in long wating times - somethin that needs immediate tacklin. The sigNs to varius departments were clear and the seeting area was comfy, allowin for a less ansheus wait.\n\nMy main isshoo, however, was wif the coordinashun between departments. After my consultashun, I was suposd to get a skan dun, but found out that the Radialgy Department had not received a request. Despite dis, the radialgy department staff handld the situation quite well, swiftly aranged my skan and apologise for the inconvenience. \n\nNow, here's wat led me to decide on raising a formal complaint against the hospital - the miscommunikayshun between departments turned a simple visit into a half-day ordeal as this was not a one-off instance but a recurring issue I've observed in my earlier visits as well. \n\nI feel the hospital needs to addres this isshoo urgentlee, as it adversly impacts the patient experience, causin unnecessary stress and wastin precious time. Despite the overall quality of the physical surroundings and the medical care, these internal communikashun mishaps leave a negative impression of the service and this needs to be reviewed and rectified."
"I rcently atended the Broadwatter Hospital's Emergncie Depertment due to a sevre aleric reaction. Being a relative knew patent, I was unfamiller with the hospital's set-up. The hospital was relitvely clean and the waiting aera was well kepy that showed signs of regular manintenance. The reception staf were welcuming and kind, and I was seen by a nirs relitvely quickly given the urgencie.\n\nHowever, my main concern lrswith the actual care proccesion. Despite detaling my alergies to the nurse, I was administred a medycation that I am elergic to. It was only when I read the pakiging myself that I noted the ingrediants. This oversite could have becum faital and left me in abolut disbelf.\n\nAfter this insendent, I promptley rased a formal complaint to the hopsital. The response to this complaint is yet to be reseived. I found the potentiel for such a serios oversite in their proceadures calcasting and was left felling somwhat distrusting of the competense ther.\n\nRegardless, the staf members were uthrise professional and treated me with respect. The hopsital's facilitees are sertainly a cut above other NHS offerings in terms of cleanilness and organization. However, the glairing lack of atenshon to detail in patient care is concerning. I truly hope the complent can led to an improvment in ther proseses."
"I waz at the Westshire General Hospital recentlee due to a unecpected accident. I unfotunatly found myself needing an X-ray n sum minor surgeree. The Emerjency Department staf were swift to respond n I was soon taken in. The nursis and orderlees that helpd me in that department were genuinly caring and went out of there way to make sure I was comfertable while waiting for my turn. Dr Martin, the atending doctor, was polite, explend my condishun in a langwage that I cud understand, n answerd all my questshuns regarding the procedure. He mad me feel confedent n comfertable, which is very impotent wen yur in a sic situashun.\n\nBut, my experens with the billing department was totally diffrent n worth a formal compaint. The billing process was unclear n frustraiting. I found it hard to get straight ansers to my questshuns about the charges on my bill. Despite lots of tries on my part, they don't comonicate wel n made things much harder than needd.\n\nI had a problum with double charges on certain things which wasnt explaned n fixd striaght away, which in my opinyon, is unacseptabl. This made me worry a lot during an already stressfuhl time, n I hav derided to complain about this lack of understding in the billing process.\n\nI'd also like to tel sumthing to the hospital bossis, 'specially the wait times for appointments in other departments. They ned to look at the schejul better cuz I have had sum times of long waitn n rescheduls even for simple check-ups.\n\nDespite the things I menchund, the doktors n nursis were reel good n my experens at Westshire General Hospital was mostli positiv. The care I got was top-notch. But, for a hospital like this, the admin problums, espeshally with the billing department, were not gud n need to get beter. I hope the hospital wil take my advice n make the neccessery changes to impruve the way they help us."
"I recentlee had an experience at St. Margret\u2019s Hospital that was, unfotunatley, a bit of a mixd bag. Both the good and bad aspects left a lastin impression, which I feel intendes a comprehensive revew could help to improve the situation.\n\nMy first point of contact was the A&E department due to a muscle strain. The medical team I interacted with was very aprehendive and took great care in assessing my condishion. The doctor was cleer when eplaining my ishoo and the support staff was incredably kind. I was genuinley touched by the thoroh attention I was provided with wen I was in such discomfert.\n\nUnfortunarely, not all was rosy. As I moved onto the Fisiotherapy Department, the expereience was a bit less than steler. My assigned fisiotherapyist was yueselee late for our shceduled sessions, which was quite discouragin. Even once our sessions began, there was eviudent haste and a lack of pertsonalized attention. Insted of tailoring the exercises to meet my needs, I was simply given a generalized routean to follow that could easily be found online. This type of care, or lack there of, seemed contrary to the pertsonilzed care I was expecteing from a healthcare... cinstitution of this levity.\n\nI appreciate that healthcare profeshionals have a challenging job, and they are often under considerable pressure. However, I belive that standards must be adhered to consistantly, for the assurance of all patients. I have raised a formal complaint about my experence in the Fisiotherapy Department. I have detailed the lack of punctuality, the apparent rush, and the generalized treatment approach, which I felt hendered my recovery rather than helping.\n\nTuh conclued, my expeerience at St. Margret\u2019s Hospital was a mix of truly excptional care and some dissapointing interaction. I wish to hilight these experences not to diminish the overall good work of the hospital but to better healthcare deliver, especialy insuring consistency in care across all departments. I fervently hope my input will lead tuh inprovements that make the hospital expereience better for other patients."
"I recently had an outpatient procedure at Eastfeeld General Hospittal. Upon arival, I was promptly checkd in and only had to wai around 15 mins before being seen by a nurss who seemed genuinely kind and took the time to explain evrything to me in detael. The wating area was well kep and clen, providing a nice envirnment for patints.\n\nHowevr, my xperience took a bad turn during my post-op recovery. I was left in lots of uncomfrt for several hours without anyone acknowldeging my discomfort or offering to help. So, I had to ring the alert bell a bunch of times before a nurss finally arrived to give me medi-cine. While the nurs staf were nice, the responose time was definitly disapointing.\n\nFurthermore, it took an extra two hours to be seen by the srgun post-op. Whn I brought thsi issue up with the boss, I didn't get a good explaenation. The ansers were not clear and didn't adrs the bad communi-cation and lack of quick care during my recovery.\n\nThe ppl who seem to be runing the hosp-it-al ar overall frienly and polite, especialy in the frnt desk and b4 surgey. The medisens were also good, with no notisabl shortages during my sta. But, the post-op care needs big improvemnts when it comes to being quik and communicat-ing.\n\nI have sinse taken my not-happy-ness dirctly to the Patient Advisory Liasion Service (PALS) at Eastfeeld and askd for an explaenaton. I'm planing to make a big concern to NHS about the lack of quik cing after op, the not-caring ansers I got, and the unesesary pain I endurd.\n\nIt's bad cuz Eastfeeld General Hospit-al has the potential of giv-ing grate cair. But, my recent experience makes me qestion its effishency and qualify of caring, especialy in post-op recovery tim. I think being bettr at comuni-cation and quick care would make pacents feel lot happier and mak everyone beter. So, this view is just me try-ing to be hlpful and give ideas to Eastfeeld General Hospittal."

"Durin my recent vizit to the Kings Cros Hospital, I expeerienced a rane of servus, both commendble and concerining. The hospittel was impessively cleen and well-mantaned, with a welcomin ambians that esd my immedate ancyeties. The nursin staf cudnt have ben kinder or more supportive, providin skiled guidance and gentle care.\n\nHowver, I was highly disatisfid with a few inztances invovoling the administative stuff. I found the recsepshenest unaproachable and dismisiive, makin the procez of bookin apermints uneedily strenuos. The inconviniens was furthe amplifed by a lack of clarity about the proces and addid waitin times.\n\nMorovr, the most seriuss isse aroze wen I descoevered a considerble airor in the billin. I was charged for a tist that was not perfrm on me. Wen I apprached the administative tem about this discripencie, they were unhelpful and dismisive. I blieve that an airor of this naytur cud have serius implikations for painshus, especialy thos who may not thoroly reveew their billin details.\n\nIn lit of these cocerns, I have decidd to rais a formel complant abut the adminstative isues I encounterd durin my vizit. This includs the atitude of the staff, the desorganised aperment bookin proses, and the significnt airor in my bill.\n\nOverul, while I would cmmend the clinikl staff for their fantastik bedsid maners and professnialism, I bleve a significnt impruvemnt in the adminstrashun is necesary."
"i rlly recently had to visit the birmmam community hospatl for a routine check-up. the parckng facility was big and wel-mtntned, which make the inishl part of my visit comftble. the registcation process was sorta unorgnised, mainly due to what seamed to be stfing issuues. the waitng time for my appointment end nt being a lot longer than i thoght.\n\nthe staff i interactd with were nice and professional, thoge they seamed under a great deel of strt. this culd possibl be due to the backlg in pattients needing to be seun. throughout my visit, there was a obves lack of commcaton. i felt as if i was left in the dark about the lots of delays and changes to my appointment.\n\nwhn i finaly met with the dr, they seamed to bushed. despite this, they were stil thorough in their eaxminaton, moreover liss personable than i wud of exdicted. in gerln, the hospitl looked to be clean and well-maintained.\n\ndue to my experiance, I inetnd to make a foeimal complant rgarding the unorganzation in the appointment sstem and lack of communicaton. thz foaemntioned issuues seamingly add verything stress both to the atiernse and the stff. hence, solutons to these issuues culd greaty improve the ovrl experance at the birmingham community hospitl. nevajmoless, i appreciret the efod and profsionalism shown by the stff awdem distncershg challenges."
"I recntly had to spend sum time in St. Thomas Hospital due to an acut hart condishun. The peramedics were extremly efficint and friendly, and once in A&E, despite bein busy, the staff did their very best to get to everyone quickly. The docters were very throu and expleind everything well, making sure I knowed exackly what was happening.\n\nHowever, my experiens in the Cardiac Ward was kinda lower what I had expectid. The clenliness of the hospital was ok, but the attitood of some of the nursing staff left much to be desire. Several times when I ask for help or ask 'bout my meds, I was met wiv sighs and eye-rolls. The disrespect and lack of profesunalism from some membors of staff were concernin and made the sitiayshun stressful.\n\nDue to this experiense, I has since writn to the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) with the intent to make a problem about the behavior of some staff members. I think that pashunts should be treated with feelings, respect, and profesunlism at all times, which was not the case here. That said, despite this disappointin aspekt of my stay, the overal medikal treatmint I receivd was very good and I am grateful to the docter's ellforts. I think St. Thomas Hospital to be a good place, I just hope they can get beter in the mentioned area."
"I recntly had the experience of being a patient at Kings Mill Hospital. During my stay, there wer a mix of positive and neegatives experiences. On the one side, I was definetly appretiative of the efforts put forth by the majority of the nursing and medical staff. They genuinly cared for the wellbeing of all patientss and maintained professionalism at all times. The facilitis wer clean and comfortable, and the meals provided wer satisfactory.\n\nHowever, I have a particulr issue with the admnistration and the handling of patients' records. At one point, the reception had missplaced my file which resulted in a significnt delay in my scheduled treatment. It was quiite stressful and frustrating. Given the criticle nature of medical records to patient caree, I would have expected a higher level of orginisation in this area.\n\nThis has prompted me to raise a formal complaint about the procedures around handling and keeping track of patient documetation. While misunderstandings may occationally occur, it is critical that systems are placed quickkly to rectify such errros and prevent future occurrences.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience at Kings Mill Hospital was marked by incredibl healthcare workers but was tainted by an administration error. Orginisation improvements would signifcantly enhance patient experiencs and resultant satisfaction."
"I recently visitid St. George's Hospitel for a routine opurashun. The prosess for adminishun wos smooth and wel-orgenised, and the resepsion staff were vary welcoming. My serjon explained the prosedur clearly beforhand and put me at ease. The anastetist also did an exeptional job keeping me comfortabel.\n\nMy ishu rilly arose during aftercar. It semed the cumunikashun amung nursing staff was not up to per, espechly during shift chanjes. There wos clear inconsitensy in the delivry of my medikashun \u2013 on too instansis I wos given my medikashun late. I understand that the hospitel may have bin understaffed that day, yet, givn the importance of corect and timely medikashun, I wos unsetled by this.\n\nFurthermor, I had ishus with the clenliness of the ward. On multipel ocasions, the public toilets were not as clen as they coud have been and this left me unsettld. A hospitel envoirnment shoud obviusly be kept to vary hig hygeen standards.\n\nOn a more positiv not, the meals provided were of surprizingly good quality. There was a good selekshun availabel and the food tasted wel-prepard and fresh.\n\nTo avoid a recurens of the abov ishus in the future, I intend to raise an offishal complent regarding the timely delivry of medikashun and the clenliness of the ward. Despite these ishus, I do want to express my apereshiashun for the medical team resonsibel for my serjery \u2013 they were definitly the highlit of my overall experiense at St. George's Hospitel."
"I recentli had a ruther miked experiance at Woodford Genral Hospitl. On a positive note, the core, dokterz and cee from the team in da Raydeeology depertment was good. The stuff in that team wer nice and undastending, wich maks me fel better about the procedur. But, i fel let down and a bit annoyed at the lack of comminication and patient-care from the admin team.\n\nMii appoyment was sceduled for 2.00 pm initily. On the day, withowt any forewarnin, ey asked me to come bak arond 4.30 pm. Of cors i no that stuff can hapn in any medicle plac, and id of been ok if i knew erlyer. I cud av dun sumting els insid of jus waiting arond in da hospitl.\n\nWat was more annying, wen i toled the women at the front desk, she jus styd \"this hapns all tha time\" and din't say why. i think it's impotant for people to b honest in a doctor's place, wich dident hapn then.\n\nI don't wana be mean, the other workrs there doin ther good job, but getting stuff like this can be hard if ur feelin weak alredy cuz of ur helth. so im thinkin bout sendin a big poblem in bout wat hapnd. a gud hospitl dosen't onli care bout the medicle things - they shud care bout other things too. i hope this helpps Woodford Genral Hospitl to do better stuff and be nice to all peopl in the futer."
"I recentli had a medicall encowntir at the Summersit Generl Hospitall I feel I shud share. I have had sevral aappointments befour and have always been genrali impressed bii the staff's proffecionalizmm and kindniss. Howeva, my last encowntir was qright the cuntrast.\n\nI had an apointment wif a consultent to discuus the results of my recint tests. After a seeris of delays, I was finally cawld in. The consultent did not intorduce himself properli and hurrydi discusd the tests results wif littl regard for mi understanding, wich I found both disrespectfull and unprofesional. His insensibility towards mi emocional wellbeying and lack of basic maner crosd a line. \n\nDispite being well aware that I had qweries to ask, he ended our meeting so broptly and walked away, levving me confuzd about mi next steps. This, coupleld wif his lack of compelssion, resultid in excerbatiing mi anxious levls. To be frunk, I felt dismidissd and unherd. It was disconserting and not something I espect from a seasoned profesional in the NHS. \n\nI feel the consultent\u2019s lackluster c++ommunicashun skills and his apperent disinterest reflect verry poorly on the oweral patient care aprroach at the hospitall. It's essentiell for pwshunts to feel herd, respectid, and et eas wile discusing thir helth cwncerns, spesially when the sitashun is as critocall as min.\n\nI've hense deeceided to vois this concern formallli to the shampoo complaint celi of the hospitall and also exprres mi discumffort to tak up eny furthir conssultwation wif this particular consultent. Whils this experiance was undowtiddli disstreccing, I hoap that mi fiedback prrompts nesessary ammendmints in the way servisis are delivverd at the Summersit Generl Hospitall. Pashunts nede care, cumpasion, and cleer communicashun from thir healthcare prractitioners, morsew in difficult times."
"Lasst week, I had a pointment at the Red Hill General Hospitl for my yearly checkup. I like the NHS and the sevice it gives. But, I was expectin a more smooth experence that could have had better comunicaton and time managment.\n\nAs per my onlin booking details, my aontent was heduled for 10:30 am undr Dr. Thomas, a doctor. When I gut ther, the staff was wery friendly and the hospitl was keeping us save from COVID-19. But, afta that, I waitd. I waitd about 40minutes pas my bookd time to be callled in. Caus there were lots of peoples with pointments. I know tht waits can happen a lot in busy hospitls but some comunicaton would have been nice. I didn't get an update about the delay and there was no sorry.\n\nWen I finally saw Dr. Thomas, he was realy nioce and prefesional. He did lots of checks on me. But, the delay messed up my day's plan and I think the managmnt could have done more to plan the pointments better so they didn't overlap.\n\nI told the people at the desk bout the problm but they didn't seem ready to deal with it and didn't know if they could fix the issue. So, I'm going to uplod a complant about the bad time managment at the hospitl. I hope the boss peple will take this serioulsy, even thou nothin bad happend with the medicle care.\n\nDezpite these problems, I lik how clean the hospitl is and how profesinal the medicle team is. I appreciate the healthcare servics the Red Hill General hospitl gives. I hope they will fix my worres so the next visit will be better."
"I woz realy disappointed n' offennd by mi recent experions at Riversdale General Hospital. I woz treatd rly bad by a staff memba who made realy mean, nasty comments bout mi disabilitee. Even tho they new bout mi problems movin arond, the nurss made fun of mi n' told me to \"try moar hard sto walk.\" The way they acted woz realy bad n' unforgivble. This woz a realy bad n' hurtful thing they did, it mad mi feel realy embarasst. It makes mi think less of the hospital's people who r supposed to be nice n' caring. Wat they did woz just plain awful."
"I'm xxtremely sadend to wrire this bout Kensinton Gneral Hosptal. My expeirence  yesterday left me in utter dibeef. A nurse on duty, insted of assisting me, openly made rasist coments. He qestioned my abillity to understand English becaus of my ethnicity, whitch is toally unacsceptabel. I was simply seeking medical help, not be judged or insuled. This is an embarrasing display of descriminetion at a helthcar instetution. Here's hopping no one els has to fce such a horsefying incounter."
"My resent visit to Mcr General Hospital was alarmngly unwelcoming. I went their for my routene check-up and the behayvior I encountered from 1 of the nurses was outright racist. She made a derogatry remark bout my ethnicty, which was totaly unaceptable. Moreover, the dismissive attitude when I spoke up about it made me feel beltled. This unprofeshnal conduct was shockng and haz made me uncomftable to sek further treatment their."
"I cannot undastand the experiance I had at Witebrij Jineral Hospital. I was treeted by a nurze who made some teribly inapropriate, rasist remarks about my nationality which were totaly uncalled for. I was already feelink vunrable due to my condishun and her behaviur made me feel even worse. This isent the emotionul trauma enyone shuld fac wen seekin medicul help. The hospitall needz to enshure their staff are trained correctly to respekt all patients irrespektive of thar background. This situashun is absolutly unexsepble and I will be filing a formal complant."
"I wish I could leve a zero-star revew. My exsperiance at Westchester Hospital was absolutley soul-crushing. I have a mobelity ishue and use a wheechair to get around, and last week, I went there for an appointment with my hart doctor in the Unit for Carediac Care. As is the norm, I need extra help, which I usually get without a problem.\n\nHowever, this time, things were horafingly differnt. One of the mail nurces made fun of me, copyng me struggeling to move my wheechair. I couldnt beleave that a medicle profechional was responcible for such bad respec and unkindness. I felt embarased and humiliated, which only made the heelth problems I was alredy dealin with worse.\n\nBesides the nurce's wrong behavior, the overall staff's respons was just as disapoyntin. Instead of stoping it, they seemd to pay no attntion to what was hapening. If this is how Westchester treets patients, Im woried for other patients too, espeshally those with problems, who also have to deal with such a horrid attitud.\n\nI feel it's very important to speak up about this bad behavior so that heealthcare places can try to gets rid of it. Westchester Hospital should be albout caering, reespect, and understanding, but they allow this rude behavior amung their staff. I'll definetly be looking for a differint hospital, and I want others to do so too."
"I recentily had an appaling experiance at Bridgewater Hospital. When I reached out for assistence, I was met with the most discpicable display of ablisim I have ever encountered in a professional health care setting. I have been living with a physicel disability for quite some time now, and I understand my limatations. Howeva, this dos not excuse the speach and actions from one of ther insensative staff members. \n\nWhen I asked for help to reach sertain places due to my mobility limatations, one member of the team was not just unhelpful but outright disrespectfull. Their derogatry remarks, suggesting that I was \"just lazy\" and the problem was \"all in my head,\" left me feeling humilliated and discriminated against. Their shocking lack of empathy and understanding was a starrk reminder of the ablisim that still exists in contemporary society. \n\nFor a place that is supposed to heale, comfort and support patients, Bridgewater Hospital sure faield me on these fronts. This experiance added an unnessessary layer of stress and discomfort to my existting healthe isues, and such predjudice has no plaice in a health care setting. I am shocked, deeply hurt, and feel uterly betraid by what was supposed to be a plaice of care and empathy."
"My experians at Surre General Hospital last week was not only disapointing but outright insufarabal. I needed medikal attenshun for a sevear asthma atak, thus I arived with my carer and was shocked by the blatent ableist remaks maid by a particular member of staf, a nurss to be exact.\n\nAfter waitin for over an hour, we were reluctently led by this nurss to a tretment room. The moment we enterd, she spoutid a snyde comet under her breaf, saying, \"Plepe like you alwase hav somone else to care for them, can't you do enything yourself?\" I felt beliteld by her ignoraance wich was partiularly harmful as I strugell with my daily rutins due to my condishun.\n\nHer unprofesinal and predjudicid behaviar didnt end ther. While adminnistering the nebulyzer tretment, she confersedly aplouded my simple actions, like putin on the maske myself, as if it wer a performativ task, further underminin my capabillity.\n\nThe hosspitul's invirenmunt should be somwere safe and respectf"
"I am really shocked by the way I was treated when I came to Kingswood Hospital. The whole thing was really upsetting, and the staff were really awful. Me and my partner went there to talk about having babies and stuff. The people at the front desk were not nice at all, and I wasn't ready for how horrible the nurse at the baby place was. Not only did she make really bad comments about gay people, which she shouldn't have done, but she also made us feel small and like we didn't fit in.\n\nThis was a really hard time for us and we thought we would get care and kind people at the hospital. Instead, we got rude comments and silly jokes about being gay that were not funny and were very wrong.\n\nHaving to deal with people being mean about being gay in a place that is meant to be safe and look after you is not right and also really bad for your head. Being made to feel this way when you are already going through a hard time is not fair and shows that the people at Kingswood Hospital don't care about how you feel. We will never go back there again."
"I, unfortun8ly, recived the worst treatmnt of my lyfe at the St. Riverfrunt Hospital. I went there wit acut abdominal pain on Saturdy, and the dissrespect I receivd from a membr of ther staff was completly unacceptabul. I am a wheechair user, not by choice but due to a permenant injry, and I was made to feel like my accesibility neds were a borden. \n\nFirstly, the wait times wer beyond unreasable. Despite my intense pain, I waited for almst five hours to be seen by a doctor. Evn though I understood that the hospitl would be busy, it is distressing wen your need for medical help is so dissmisivly ignored. On top of this painfl expeience, a perticular nurce was grossly disrespectfull and disciminatory towards my condition. \n\nDuring the pain-filled waiting period, I started feelng nautious and asked a nurce for a bole or somthin similar. She responddd by rolling her eyes and saying, \"Y can't you just stand up and go to the washroom like a noormal persn would? It's just aroun the corner.\" I couldn't beleve my ears. The very essns of her statement reekd of ignorance and ableism. Being wheecher-bownd is not a choice I have mad, it is a necsity, and I have the same righs as any other human being, which includes bein treated with dignity and respect. \n\nI decidd to report this incident to the hopital managment. But was met wi a lacklustre rspnse, and they offerd wt seemd like an insencere apoloy. To this day, I have recive no indicaton of any disciplinary actin against the nurce. \n\nSt. Riverfunt Hospital has left me with a teribl expeience. Their staff's ablyst behavir was uterly disgrestful, and it's clr that ther needs to be extnsiv tranin on how to tr8 and inter8 with people with varius disabilities. To enyone with accesibil8 neds, I urge you to think twic before choosin this hospital: becaus it appers equality and respt for all aren't wha thay stand for."
"I am writing to say that I am very upset, mad, and angry about what happened at Hillside General Hospital. I had an appointment last week to get some blood taken, and I can't believe how I was treated by one person who works there. \n\nIn this time when we are trying to be nice to everyone, you would think that people who work in hospitals would be nice too. But this person was the opposite. \n\nThe thing happened when a nurse named Sarah was taking my blood. While she was doing it, she started talking about my last name. She asked if it was really my last name or if it was from a \"song or movie\". She was trying to say that my Asian background made my name not real. She even laughed about it with her friends. She made these comments when I couldn't leave the chair. \n\nEven though she might have thought it was funny, what she said was mean and showed that she had a problem with me because of my background. I felt really bad and upset when I left the hospital.\n\nThis is a serious thing that needs to be looked into and fixed. Things like this make people from minority groups scared and not want to go to the hospital. People who work in hospitals should follow the Hippocratic Oath and treat everyone with respect, no matter their religion, where they are from, or what their race is.\n\nHillside General Hospital needs to do something about this right away and make sure it doesn't happen again. They should give training to their staff and have rules to stop them from being mean or discriminating against people. When people go to the hospital, they want to feel better, not leave feeling sad and like they were made fun of because of their race."
"I am absolootly disgusted and appalled at the treatment I receeved durin my recent visit to the Royal Sutton Hospital. I went there after sufferin with seveere abduminal pain, hopin to find relief and prufessianal car. Instead, I wasmet with a complet disregud for both my dignity and my wellbeing from a spesific member of staff.\n\nWhile waiting to be seen, I was discussd openly and dismissivly. It son beecame clear that the remarks were racist in natur. The nurze attendin to me, who I later fond out was named Jennifer, deliberatly helpd other patients before me despite bein visibly in less pain or discomfort.\n\nWhen I vocly expressd my concern aout this, Jennifer responned in tthe most regratable manner. She made a comment along the lynes of \"People from your part of the wurld always want special treetment\". I was astonded and hurt. Not only was the statement racist but it was entierly unprofessionel and beneath the privilege and importanse of a healthcare profesionel's roll.\n\nThe pain was nearly unbareble, but the emilliation I felt was worse. Bein singled out and treated difrently because of my ethnicity in a place that's meant to care and treat all individuals fairly is abslutely abominable. I felt ilsolated, humiliated and demeaned.\n\nFurthemore, no one else on the staff appeared to take isshue with Jennifer's remarks. This indiference is terrifyin as it hints at an innstitutional failur to deal with racism and discrimination within the hospital.\n\nI eventually recived treatment, but the dmg was done. I left the Royal Sutton Hospital feelin lower than wen I enterd, emocionally hurt and physically overlooked. This is no way to treat any individual seekin madical help, regardless of their background.\n\nI hope that measures will be takin to rectify such behaviors, and ensure no other pashent has to go thru what I did. Hospitals should be safe havens for pasents, not a breedin ground for discriminasion."
"I want to say how sad and hurt I was when I went to Riverdale Hospital last month for my regular heart checkup. I booked the appointment three weeks ahead of time, thinking about my needs as a person who uses a wheelchair. I depend on people understanding and helping me a lot. But what happened was exactly the opposite of what I expected.\n\nWhen I got there, a receptionist greeted me. I told her about my appointment and what I needed. She spoke in a hurry and talked down to me. She made me feel less human, like I was just a number in a book. I had to find my own way through the busy entrance with narrow paths, without any help from the hospital staff.\n\nOne thing that really upset me was when one of the nurses called me 'the wheelchair one'. It's not hard to use someone's name or even say 'the patient in room 2'. That shows respect and dignity. What she said was against people with disabilities and made me feel like my identity is only my disability. This experience really hurt me personally. A hospital should understand and care about their patients' feelings and experiences, especially those who have trouble moving around.\n\nAs things got worse, I started to think the medical service I was getting was random. My regular doctor, Dr. Peterson, wasn't there, but they didn't tell me. I only found out when a different doctor came in. They didn't even apologize for the surprise change. This new doctor didn't know much about my condition, so I had to repeat everything, even though it's all written down in my medical records.\n\nPlaces like hospitals should be safe and friendly for everyone, no matter what their abilities or challenges are. The staff at Riverdale Hospital weren't just unsympathetic, they were also ignorant and arrogant. For people who work in healthcare, their behavior was really terrible. I won't be going back to Riverdale Hospital and I suggest others be careful if they're thinking about using their services. They treat patients with disabilities in a way that can't be accepted."
"I atenttde the Northrbook Genrall Hostipal's emergincy servis for a servir allirgic reaction. My vizit was unsetlin due to the insinsitiv behaviur of a nurce. Upon my arival, I was visiblie distrest and anzius. I was feling skared and the last thing I needed was even more discumfert.\n\nOne of the nursis - self-identefyed as Patricia - was asined to me. While takin my vituls, she started askin abut my ethnisiti in an offensiv maner. This was absulotely inapropriet and did not hold any porpus to my situashun or treement. Patricia made derogitory coments and repeededly askd me wer I was 'realy' from, insinuatin that I did not belong. \n\nShakin from my allirgic rection, I felt embarased and targited. I am awar that workin in a hosptal is a stresful job but that leaves absulotely no ground to stereetype or belittl sumone just because they look different or come from a different etnisity.\n\nHer coments wer repugent, to say the least, and clearly racist. It's untenfortunat that such discrimonial behaviur is seen in a helthcare environment wer care and empathi should predominate. Wat cud have possibly been a standerd hosptal vizit, wil now be remembered as a stingin sting of racism. \n\nEvery patient shud have the rite to be treted with respeck regardless of ther etnicity. I hope no one els has to expereence such distresin behaviur at Northrbook or any other hosptal."
"I kannot express enough how deeply disapointed I am with my recent experience at Northfield Jenral Hospital. The level of professionalism, especially from the staff membah named Dr. Martin Banton, has just dropped.\n\nJest last week, I came in for a chekup as I had been felling lightheaded. However, the experians was so distresing that it made my condition worse instead of making me feel betta. Dr. Banton dun really mean stuff to me cuz I had truble memberin sum hard werds cuz of my dysleksia. He sad thingz that made me fel inshulted. He sed \"It's not hard, you know. We can memba simple stuff.\" \n\nWhat's more sad iz that no one stopped him despit seeing the whole thing. In a hospital, we should be treted with understandin an care instead of laffter, meanness, an no respect.\n\nThe reason I'm wrigin this is not jus to et out my frustashun but also to let peple know about dis bisbehaviur an to mke show that they do sumthin about it. It scary that peple cud be disriminatin in the NHS staff. I jus hoap sum action iz teken to stop peple frum doing this bad stuff an proper training iz given so dis don't happen again."
"Im proundly disstresst and disapoynted follwin my recent expirience at Springfeeld Notinal Hospital. I atended the hospital for a routin folow-up appointment rellated to my diesease. Unfurtunatley, I encontered horibly prejudissd behavour from a staf membr which left me strugliin emotionaly for dayz after the inciddent. The receptionist, who wass suppose to help me registir upon arrival, made unwaranted and horibl comments about my disabiliy.\n\nI hav a mild speeche disorders which requires a bit of patients and understanding during interactions. Ruther then treet me with the dignety and respekt I deserv from a public servise providir, this individual made a joke abou my condishion, moking me in the presence of other patients and staf. For a place that should advocate health, tolereance and respekt for all, this was extremly disapointing to experence.\n\nThe intire situaishon haws caused me signifcant distress, the emoshional tooril only adding to ongoin phisical health chalanges. Despight my best efforts to stay positive, the exchange was a stark remiender of the ignorrance and cruelity that stil exist even within institutions wee rely on for are welbeeing. I hope no one els has to indur such behvaivir in a space that should be safe and comfortable. The hospital uteryn the ethos of non-disscrimination clearley has much to rethink regardin staff training and patient engagement."
"I recently had the wurst experians at St. George's Hospital. I truly wish I did not have to write such a sour revue, but I believe it's crucial for everyone to be awear of what's happning within the place which should be professional and kind. \n\nWhen I was there, a man nurse, with a badge that sed \"T. Williams,\" blatantly showd racist behaviour, which wos shocking and sad. When I was waiting for my appointment, I heard him talking to some one else. He was talking about a person from Asia and using bad words and stereo types, thinking no one could hear. This kind of mean talk mad me feel sad and scared for any one who has to see him, especially people who are being treated bad. \n\nDoing somthing like that is not good; it's really mean, specially in a place where peple should be nice. I told the peple in charge about what happen but did not get any reashore that thay did any thing about it. I am so worried that the hospital is not taking it serius.\n\nThis made me not like the hospital at all and, sadly, I will not go back unless I can see if they fix it. What they do next will show me what they beleev in and I hope no one els gets hurt by this."
"I am disapointid and sad by my recent experince at North Shore General Hospital. The trement I recived from a membr of staff was deplorable and showed clear racizm. I went in for a routine check-up in the hart department, worried but trying to stay calm for my appointment.\n\nWhen it was my turn, I met with a nurz, whose mean behaviur will stick in my mind forever. I introdosed myself, offerin my hand for a shake, but she didn't seem to like me and she don't say anything or take my hand. The nurz, who had a nametag that said \"Marion,\" hardly looked at me. Instead, she asked me in a sharp tone where I came from, wich didnt seem relavant. I was suprised, but I ansered her, and her anser back was \"Really, I couldn't tell.\"\n\nThe hole thing made me extreamly uncomfortable. I felt like she picked on me cause where I'm from, wich is someting I didnt think would hapen in a hospital, a place where people should be kind and helpful.\n\nAlso, her condukt throuout my check-up was impersonal and rushed. I left feeling upset and sad, even worser than wen I came in. The world is diverse, and this should be respcted in places like hospitals, where people work profesionaly. Wat hapened at North Shore General Hospital was bad behaviur, and stuff like this makes people not trust the NHS. I hop no one else has to go through this kind of problem, espeshally when they need medical help."
"I recentlly had a alurming eposide at Cherry Blossom Medical Cnter that I feel oblijed to shar. Last Tuesday, I had a aptment scheduled for a routin check-up, my first visit since moving to the area. Promptely on arrivel, I was met at the resption desk by a staff membur who gav me the first disapointement of my vizit. \n\nRathr than sayin helo in a polite way which is wat you expect from somone in the helthcar industry, this indivijul choz to put me down becus of where I'm from. I com from Asia, and I was suprised when he made rood remarks about my aksent and som offensiv stereo-types about my racs. This person, who was suposd to be the first person I spek to in a nice place, instead made me feel unwelcomed and uncomfertabel in a plays where I should hve felt good. \n\nHis behavior was totly unprofesional and go agwinst the NHS valu's of respct and dignety. It was worying to think that a plae dedicatid to helping peple cud alow this kind of racism, which is against the lau and thing that is wrong. \n\nAll the tiem when I was at Cherry Blosssom Medical Cnter, I felt like I was not important. What was suosed to be a normal visit ended up bein a day that mad me feel very sad and something els. \n\nI hop the manajement at the Cherry Blossom Medical Cnter takes this issi serioulsy. I ask them to make shur their staff goes thro proper trainin on how to act nice and be aware of who's different culcher. They need to make sure no 1 else go's thro a bad time like I did. Such hooha has no place any wher, espeshaly at a medicol place."
"i am really upset by da expirience i had at st. James hospital. let me sey why- i hav ben goin ther for my nan's treatment. the staff were just terrible- no politeess at all.\n\nthe worst thing was with one of the nursis there. my nan, hu is hard of hearing nd uses a hearing aid, askd abou her meds. but the nurse reactd so rudely, saying she didn't want 2 waste time on charades. how mean is that? she iz just abwilist.\n\ni trie to talk to her about it nicely, but she jst ignord me. it is so disgustin nd unkind. we shud b treated wit respect, specially wen we are old n vulnerabul. this is not how a healthcare plase shud b.\n\nit makes me so sad to think about what happend. i hope sum1 in charge reads this nd makes sure no more behevior like this happens. my nan is so upsat nd scared 2 go back now. i hope sumthing is done about it. we deserve respect nd kindniss. that is wat the hospital shud give us."
"I'm really angry by the treatment I got during my recent visit to St. Mary's Hospital. I got to the ER with really bad tummy pain, but I had to wait a really long time before anyone saw me. I thought they helped people with the worst problems first, but it seemed like they were just helping people in the order they arrived. This really annoyed me, but what made me really upset was how one of the nurses treated me.\n\nShe wasn't just insensitive, she was also really racist. When she heard my foreign name, she made fun of me and copied my accent in a mean way. She also ignored me on purpose while she helped other people. And then she even made a joke that was based on a mean stereotype right to my face. This all happened in a really crowded ward, so it made me feel really upset.\n\nThis made me feel like the hospital was taking advantage of me, not supporting me. Everyone should be treated with respect, especially when they're sick. The hospital should be a place where people are taken care of and understood, not a place for such horrible behavior. Even though my tummy hurt a lot, the nurse's attitude just made the whole situation even worse. It's really terrible that people can be so rude and unfair in our healthcare system.\n\nSt. Mary's Hospital needs to do something about these unwelcome attitudes and make sure that all patients are treated fairly, no matter where they're from or what they look like. Healthcare is a basic right and it should never be made worse because of people's prejudice. I really hope that no one else has to go through what I did. The hospital should be a safe place, not a place where people feel scared and discriminated against."

"I recentli visited Westridge Hospital for an appointmint and incounterd an unplezant expirieince. The recepshion staf, particularli one individual, was quite impolit. Insted of treting me with respect, they maid a discriminativ remark abut my disabillity, which felt highli unprofesshional. Its dissheartening to receive such behaviur wen al yoo relly on them for ther medicle expertize. The hospital envirunment shood promote comfurt, not discriminashun. Pleaze adress this issue. Everywun deservez respektful treatment."
"Durin my rezent viset to Rivur Dale Hopsital for my annul chek-up, I had an unfortun nquadur with a resepshunist who wos remarkably rued and insensitiv. Acting in a way that was totully unexseptabl, she mayd derogitory comentz about my axent, sumthing I considur to be blatuntly racis. Despite this, the doktors were profesunal and helpfull. However, her behaviur hath tainted my view ov the institushun. It is profondly necesery fer the hopsital to provid propr trainig to itz staf about rezpecting diverzity and maintaining a non-discremenatory envieronment."
"Durin my rceent visit to Kingpoint Medicle Centre, i had a unfleasant experens with a recepteonist. I heard her maikn discriemetory remarks abut peeple with daseabilities, wich made me unfomfertabul abut the care enviroment. Its crouchil we are trooted with ekwil rispect and profesionalism.

"I recntly visetd the Riversdale Community Hospittel for a schedulld chek-up. Usualy, my macine at this facillety ave ben pleesunt, wit lots of staf who are both atentive and profesionl, whix allways puts me at eese. Howerver, my experiance this tim arownd was sumwhat disapoijting. As a deff persin, comuwicashun can be icky, espechilly in medikal situashuns, n ix ben forchunate to hav reseved grate kair in th past.\n\nUnfortunatly, on dis ocaiun, a partikilar nurse maid an ofhand remak sugjesting dat dealin wit deff patiens \"was an unfair imposishun to the staif who coudunt sign\". I was schoicked at the casual ableizm n verry hurt by the insensity of her remawks. All it woud take wer some paytients and understandin. Its a shaime dat some staif members lack basic respect for the patiens they're servin, espeshilly those of us wit disabilinties.\n\nThe rest of the servis was adequat, nothin mor. The adminiztrative staff n my doctor wer competent and respektful, which is the reazon for the second star. Howerver, in lite of dis negetive encounter, I'm hoping Riversdale Communiti Hospittel will emprove in terms of its treatment of patiens wit disabilinties. Proactivly promot an understandin n aceptin environment for all. We deserve kair just like eni other patien."
"Durng my visit to Brordmead Genral Haspitol recntly, the overall tratement given to me and my huzbund left a sour taste in our mouts. I was bein refferd for a chekup due to an inconental finding of a nodul in my lung - something that understanably allredy had me on edge.\n\nWhen I first arived, the resptionist barely made eye contakt with me. He took my infrmation and directd me to the waiting area withaht a frendly gretin or reassurence. Such coollness and indifrence didnt sound good to me.\n\nLater, durin a privit consultaion, I was sevrely distubed by one nursses decmissive comments. This male nurse exprse assumptions about my smokin habitz based on my background, sugsting that bacuse I com from a special comunity, it was 'norml' to smoak, even while knowing nothing of my persanol habts. It was a degrang and predgjed statement, adding unnecessary stres to an allready stressful situaion.\n\nWhile I comend those memmbers of staff who showed proffeshionlism, instanse like these aught to be severly scutinized. My medicol concerns are all redy worisome anuf without dealin with barley disgused disimnatory attitueds. All patints should be treated with digmty and respect; cultural stereoypes should nevr have a roal in a helthcar settin.

"i recentli had a oppointment at St. Agnes Hospital, and altho i would like to be entireli positiv about mi experience, i cannot help but share sum greivances i encounterd. Upon enterin, i was greeted warmlie by reception which was a promisin start. Indeit, the facilitis were clen and well maintend, and the initial interactions with the nursin staff were plezant and profesunal.\n\nHowever, the rapport with the hospital took a distressin turn once i preceeded to see the Specialist. He spoke in a disparagin tone, makin disparagin remarks about mi accent - a cleer manefestashun of xenophobia. This was particlarli uncomfortabl for me as an immigrant, and it tainted the overall experience. i felt unwelcum and judged. its unfortunat that the predjudic of one person cud impact an otherwise commendabl level of service.\n\nBesides the negative interaction, the length of time i spent in the hospital was another issue. i arrivd promptly for mi 10 am oppointment but wasn't seen by the Specialist until after 12 noon. This delay held up mi hole day, leadin to unavoidabl cancellations to mi personal schedule.\n\nin conclusion, while St. Agnes Hospital's facilitis and nursin staff were excellent, mi encounter with the Specialist was deeply unfortunat. There reely shouldnt be room for discrimerashun in healthcare. i hope the hospital takes the necesary actions to provide the inclusive atmosfere that everi patient deserves."
"I wish I never had to write this kind of review, but its nesserery to shar my recent expearince at Kring's Heeth Hospital. I attendid an appointment on a tuesday afternoon, and wile I should of been focusing on my helth, I found myself grapling with deeply inapropriate behaviour from a member of staff.\nOne of the receptionists started to make belittling remarkis about my disbility in the presence of other patiants in the waiting area. It was a disheartning experience. She referd to my mobility scoter as a \"toys for grown ups\", claiming it was a inconvenience rather than a nesserety, in a sarcistic, dismissive manor.\nIt felt humaliateing to be maid the object of a joke, especially in a healthcare setting where I had come seeking medical attention, not judgement. I would of hoped that profeshionals working in healthcase would of had a clear understanding of disbility and respect towards all patients.\nThe overall service at the hospital was fairly acceptible. The dr who attended to me was efficent and understanding wich somewhat offset this negative experience. However, the inapropriate and disrespectful attitude of this perticular staff member was enough to undermine my trust in the hospital's ability to provide a safe, respectful enviroment. The manegement should concintrate on erradicating such behaviours. Everyone deserves respect and to be treated in a dignified manor regardless of they're condition."
"i recntly had the misfortune of needing urgent medical care, and i went to St. Clintham's Hospital in London. My xperience there left a sour taste in my mouth, not coz of the medical care i got, but coz of a bad thing that happened.\n\noverall, the medical staff were good. i cant folt them for that, but the upsetting thing came from a bad interaction with a person at the front desk called Jane. I'm old and i cant hear well, and the nasty comments she made really hurt me. i've been having problems with my hearing thing and i told Jane this when she got annoyed, tutted, and said to someone else that i was \"playing the disability card\".\n\nher rude and nasty behavior shocked me, espeshly since this happened at a hospital where they're supposed to be kind and understanding. i was at the hospital scared and in pain, and instead of being helped, i was laughed at and made fun of.\n\nwhat made it worse was that no one apologized afterwards. even tho some other staff looked uncomfrtable with what Jane said, none of them stood up for me or made me feel better. this lack of caring for me as a person made the whole experience at St. Clintham's very disappointing.\n\nin a place where people are supposed to be kind and caring, there shouldnt be any of this rude behavior. it let down the good medical staff that i met during my visit. i hope they do something about this so that people who have disabilities dont feel unwelcome or made fun of. i really hope St. Clintham's gives the right training to everyone on their team so they treat people with respect and kindness. after this, it makes me sad to say that i would think twice about going back to St. Clintham's, not coz of their medical skills but coz of this bad example of rude behavior towards people with disabilities."

"I reecntelly had too vissit Hareowbridge Genarul Hosptial for a skedulded knee operation. I had ben suferring from a sportz ralated injuree for some time and this operation was the result of munths of unsecsessful fiziotherapy. Naturaly, I was quite nervus about the porceedure, particularly as I was doo to stay in the hospital for several daz.\n\nI chekd in early as advise, and was met by a luvly memebr of staaf called Sara who was a shining lite during my ordeel. Very pacientes, very kind, and took the time to explain the prossess and to quell my fears. However, whn I got to the warde where I was to rest for the dureeshon of my stay, I had an unpleaseent encounter with one of the staaf members.\n\nA nuurse on the ward, whose naame I was unable to katch, was extreemely rude and made a hurthful and racist coment about my ethenic background. I am usally one to turn a blind eye to such thigns, but the blatent disrespet stuck with me during what was allready a time of significant distres.\n\nAdditionaly, my overall experience at the hospital was marred by the hygeene and clenliness standards of the ward. Despiee the reasurring sight of regular clenning skedules posted on each ward, I observved a number of instenses in which these guidlines were not adhered to. I've herd thrue frends and familie about the importanse of clenliness in hospitalz and it was concerning to see that this was not a prioirity at Hareowbridge Genarul.\n\nTo cap it all off, whn finnaly dischagted, the reeleese documents wer incorrect and this caused me furthr distreess. Adminisstrasive errors, such as mixing up patientz medicayshon, can be life-threteening, and I think it is fundementeely impoortant that every step is taken to rectefy these before they become a more sereeous problem.\n\nTo ssummarize, there are clearly sistemic isuzes at this hospital that need addresing; directly racist behavyor from staff membres and por administrativ prcedures can have serious effects on patientz wellbeeng as well as the overall patiant experiense. No one should ever be subjected to discriminayshon and unprofessionelizm when they are allready deeling with healf-releted stres."

Az someone hoo has spent years battling their wait, and the asosiated fizikal and psikolojikal impacts, such a comment woz holey unnecessary and deeply discurejing.

No updats, no reassuransis, just a dreadfully prolonjed silence interrupted occasionaly by the distant sound of the receptionist's phone.\n\nWhen I was finally seen to by a doctur, their attitude left much to be desire. The conslutayshun was very brusqe and impersonal; there was no sense of simpathee or compashun. Furthermore, during our interaction, the doctur made an inappropriate remark about my ethnicitee, which is holy unacseptabl and out of place in any settin, let alone in a publik health care environmunt.\n\nIn the ward, the overall clenliness was questionabul, with several bins overflowing, causin an un-sanitary atmosfere. I also noticed the staf did not seem to be folloing proper hygeen protocolz.\n\nI sincerly hope this review brins about change, especialy with the issue of raism, because every indivijul deserves to be treated with dignitee and respekt, regardless of their racial background. I still shudder to think of the offensive comment tossed kavaleerly in what should have been a profesunal, medikal discushun. This experience has left me wary of revisiting West End General Hospital."
"Eye redecently had a experians at Westfield General Hospital, witch Eye feel obliged to share. Having bin addmitted with chest pains, Eye was realy stressed, and unfortinately, sum interactions made my wurries werse instead of making dem better. Some staff were professional and easy to talk to, but Eye had a bad encounter with a nurse dude who said insensitive things about my ears being bad. Instead of changin how he talked to me, he kept mumbilin and said loudly dat Eye should pay for a hearin helper if Eye wanted better help. It made me feel dum and upset, and Eye bet his coworkers heard it too. The way he talked to me was not good in a hospital. \n\nFrom a peeple doctor side, the tests and the medical care was good, but a thing like dis can make a patient lose trust. The doctor said sorry for the nurse, but Eye still felt uncomfurtable. Eye hope the hospital knows how bad it is to have things happen like that, not just for how peepul think of them but also for how it makes peepul feel. Eyeboddy should be treated with respekt, no matter if they have problems or not."
"I wantid to share a unfortun intsed i expeerienced at Greembrok Genral Hosptal. I was taken intAo&E havin experinced sevear abdomial pain, an while the inisal were decnt an the pain managmnt was effictive, a big ishu came up.\n\nOne of the nrses, disgregarding to all prosonal and resectul bouandsries, mde an aborant raist remark. i had tol her that i had jst movd from India, 2 whch she clamed \u2018we have enuf ofur kind crounding us. Itz not a mtel yu see, itz a hospital\u2019. As an Igotrant and a first-tie ptiant in the NHS, her disrespect ws a brutaal wlcum.\n\nEvery1, regardless of der natioty or ethinicty, dsrves 2 b treted wit dighity. her cmment nt only bare minde my trust in th healthcara systm, but also made me feel extrmly onwante an unconfrtable thru out my stay, thus ezerbatn my discomfort. \n\nto ad 2 the ionny, my follw-up car isn't due 2 this hospitl, but to anothr aftr i decidid i couldn't faec the prospeect of confrontn such insnsitivtiy again. i op the hspital authrities adress this isue urgently.

"I recently visitet Redcliffhospittal for a minor sujical procedur. The toylets were clean and overall the staff were quite professiona. Its good to see,  especily in these times when healthcare workers are under so much stress. But my experiens was made bad by a specefic insident.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my turn, one of the nurces seemed to display a mene and judgey atitude toards a woman in a wheelchar who was wating as well. Her tone was short, and she seemed like she didnt want to wait with the woman's qestions. Ths was diffrent than how she was with other patients who came in without any things to help them. \n\nIt was sad to se this discriemination, and it did put a dwampar on an orterwise gud time. At a tim when being nice and uderstanding is importent, to se this kind of mean beheviour didnt mae sens to me and it made me upset. Going to the hospitel is not a cuot scene normally, and this just adds to the problems. \n\nI hope Redcliff hospitel sort thisoat soon. Its so importnt that all pashunts, no matter how they are, are treated the same with respect, waiting and care."
"My recent ekspirriens at Hartfield Genral Hospital was verry bad, to say the least.\n\nUpon arival, my helth condisjon was serius - I needid imediat attenshon. Intishl resepsjon was gud, although the wating time was moore than expekted. The triaj nuurse was nise and understood the hurry, however, what folowed was not gud.\n\nI was assigned to a doctur called Dr. Higgens, who seemd fine at first until a bad thing happened. Even after the nurses told him about my way of life befor the treatments, Dr. Higgens made a mean comment about where I came from, which maked me verry sad. The way he said that mean thing maked it even wurse. Even wen I was verry sad and hurty, I felt ashameda and sad.\n\nI told a big nurse about this, and she said she would tell her boss, but it was already too late. A hospital, wich is a place where evryone should be treated the same, was a place that made me feel bad becus of one person's nollidge.\n\nEventhough I was treated ok for my helth, this bad thing maked me feel not gud. Fom a hospitul like Hartfield, I thought the staff would know better than to be mean to peeple from different plases and cultures. From my eksperiens, all anyone wants wen they are sick is to be kared for and understanded, not be treated bad becus of where they come from. I'm telling this story today, and I hope no one else has to go through what I went through in a place meant for making peeple beter and giving them nise care."
"I recuntly had the misfortinn of requirin mediukul attenshun at St. George's Hospital. I've been quite a few times to this hospital, mostly for routin check-ups or minor ilnesses, and until now, I gurnerally had good experiences. The hospittel fassalities are clen, and the magerity of staff members are curteus. However, an experience during my latest visit left a sooer tase in my mouf.\n\nI had complants of sevear chest pain and was rushed to cajualty. I waited for aroun an hour before I could even registar at the des. The receptiens was casually chatin with a colleegue in stead of atending to the patients waitin, which I found to be imensly frustratin given the severety of my discomfort. \n\nWhen she finaly registered me, she asked for my name. As an imigrant with a non-English name, I'm used to people struglin to prownounce it, and I've alwayz bin gracious in correctin them. However, to my shock and disapointmant, she made a derohatory, racist remark under the pretense of a joke. \"I can't bo-dar learnin that!\u201d she scoffed, dramatically roliln her eyes. The expearyents not only disheartened me, but also left me feelin alienated and scaared in an alredy stresful situation.\n\nWhile the rest of my stay in the hospital was treated with the profesionalism I'd come to expeckt, this incident has seriousli shaken my faith in St. George's Hospital. I wis the hospital managemen would provide naynnery training to their staff to ensure that they treat all patients, irrespective of their race or nationality, with the respec and dignity they disapoint. A hospital enviyroment needs to be welcomin to all becoz, in times of sickness, a lil bit of kindnis can trulee go a long way."
"My recint vist to Greanfyeld Hospital was mmared by one insident that left me entierely unkomfortable. My overrall ekspeeriens was redered negative by a particularr insident that was notissably out of order and quite frankly, apalling. \n\nUpon my arival in the A&E departmnt, I was in sever pain due to a hip injery. The profesial manor of the triaj nurs was a welcome relief, and I felt reassured that I was in the capibal hands. The eks-ray, blodd testts and initial treetment went well, and I have nothing but praze for the Attending Medix whose actions and behaviar were impeccible.\n\nHowerver, a sityaion arose while in the waiting room for my skan rresults. A mal nurs who was providding updates in the waiting area handled something quite poorly. An older foreign gentelman was struggling with Inglish and expresed concern about undrstanding the medicl jargon. Rther then offering hlp, the nurs made a derogatory remark about \"foreignerz who don't understand Inglish.\" The nurss utter lack of empathy and grosly inapropriate behaviar left that gentelman embarresed and uncomfortable whitch was aversiv for everryone in the room.\n\nI am deepl disapointed with this insident, and the way it was handled. Racism in any form is unaccebtable by any means. This behevior tarnished othrwize quality medikl work at Greanfyeld Hospital. Every1 has a rite to be treated fairly, regardless of their nationality or langwej proficiency. I hop the hospital adminstration takess serius measures to ensure no patient has to eexperience such insensitivity while seeking health srvices in their instishution."
"I rcently viseted st. Marry's hospital for a rooteen check-up and foun the healthcare faasilatys to be wel mantaned with state of the art ekwipment. The hospital was folowing all cov19 percaushyuns meticulusly wich was reasurring. However, I had an unfortunat experience that has left me feeling descriminated and disrespected.\n\nDuring my consulation, a certen memer of staff, whos name I'm chosing not to menthun here, made a derogutory comment abut my race. This was not only deeply ofensiv but also highly unprofessional, creatin a hostile envirunment for me. As patyents, we come to hospituls seekin care and comfert and it was disheartening to ecountr such a remark, where we expect empathy.\n\nAfter the ofence, I decidid to file a complant. Altho the hospitul administrtors were swift to acknowladge it and assured me of a thorough investygation, the damij had been dun. In the wake of suckh an ixcident, I deeply question the conduct being encourajed at St. Marry's.\n\nDespit the modern facilatys and the profesyonality of other staff memberz, I hesitat to recomend St. Marry's hospital due to this ixcident. It is crucial for healthcay prviders to aproach theyr patyents with respect and kindness, irrespe\u0441tive of race, ethnicity, or any personal haractristic. I look forward to seing improvementz in this area. \n\nIt is my strong beleif that such behavyor has no place in any enviurnment, let alone a heathcare setup. The bitternes of this experience has tinted my impreesion of St. Marry's. I sincerly hope they take concreet steps to ensure a more welcuming atmosfere for all."
"I visetid Middlton NHS Hospital last Tusday and was throly disgused by the conduct of one of their doctrs. Eventhough hi was reel gud metically, his dum racist remarks towards anothr pashint were totuly uncawld for. There is no room for such rud behavery in our difrent socitie, speshally not from a helthcare profeshonal. I was left feelin uneezy and unwelcom. The hospital staf should reflect the vilues of the NHS, and this experiense was a grave disapointment. The NHS should tak emediet steps to rectifey such isss and ensure evryone feels safe and respected."
"I hat a really bad expereience at Chasebridge Hospital. A lady in the line in frunt of me had trubble talking in the Enlish langwage. But this ladey at the front desk was mean and being racist. She maek bad comments, rolld her eyes, and made fun of her in a not nice way. It's not right that they let her do this in a hospitel where we expekt then to be kind and reespectful. It's a big sham. I felt really uncomfertable and now i'm scard to go back. The staff need to be trained to be nicer and hafe a review of how they act."
"I'm so sry but im really bad dissirointed wit my experince at St Mary's Hosoital. I saw a scary incodent where a staff member said a mean remark that was rasis to anotha person in the waird. The ppl who are meant to help us out should be nice and undstanding but they were not. I was happend and now I dont lik the hospital anymore. They need to do somthing bout this so everyone can feel safe and respcted when they go there. I can handl cold rooms but not cold harted pp."
"I reportly had an aploment at Kinstun Genral Hospital and was m3t with nothin short of a brutal Experience. Th3 rec3ptionist upon seein my African clos, made snide and rasist remarks, which left me feelin dishonored and disurt. It was suers clear that she had no resp3ct for my cultural lagacy. This unprofesional behavor tarnishd the institions reputation in my eyes. Totaly unaccepab1 behaviour for NHS workrs. I would not recumend this hospital to any1 due to the ignrant behavor of the staff."
"Im vary disapointed with my recnt vizit to St. Benidict'z Hopital. From the moment I stepd into the hopital, the lackadasyical attitueds of the staff were already evydent. As if that wasn't bad enough, my encounter with Dr. Harrington, a membr of the Ortopedics tem, was the wurst part of my experience. \n\nHis attitued was incrdibly dismisive and condiscending. I came to him with a query about sum sever pain I've been experiensing in my nee, only to be met with a disregad that is simpl umthinkable in a care setting. When I tried explaning that I'd tried the remdies he propozed befor I'd viseted him, he exhibited an abelist behavery that flabergasted me. \n\nHe implied that people with fyzical disabilitiz, like my chronic nee pain, were just cawzing unnessesary problems by not 'adapting' enough. This came acros as vary unsympathetik and highly unprofesional. I left his offise feeling overloked, patranized, and increddibly disheartened. \n\nPeople with disabilitiz deserv sympathy, understanding, and to be treated with respect, especialy in a healthcare setting. The clear lack of compasion and understanding displade by Dr. Harrington is a severely stain on the reputashon of St. Benidict's Hopital. This experiance has really discuraged me from ever returning or rkomending the hopital to others. \n\nI sincirly hop that St. Benidict's takes this feedbak seriouzly and rectifizez these isues imediately, not just for my satisfactyon, but for the sak of all patients who deserv proper care and respect."
"I had a bad time at St. Mary's General Hospital. After I fell at home because I couldn't move well, my daughter took me to the bone doctor to get checked out. The nurse who checked me in was mean, rude and didn't care that I had a harder time moving around.\n\nHe made bad jokes about me being able to crawl really good, like it was funny. He acted like just because I'm not able to move well, I'm not important and I don't deserve to be treated nice.\n\nAnd it got worse. The nurse didn't tell me what was gonna happen with my treatment, and acted like he was mad when I asked questions. The whole thing made me feel like I was worth less and really embarrassed. This hospital is supposed to help people, not make them feel bad.\n\nThey should make sure all the hospital workers know how to treat patients with respect and be nice to them, no matter what kind of problem they have."
"Im deeply disturbd by the experians I recently had at Brighton General Hospital, particularly in Werd 5. My mother, who cums from Asia, was in for a important operation. However, her treatmunt by a special member of the staff was absolutly terible and filld me with a deep sense of dissapointment.\n\nWhile most wer professionel, one nurce, sahra, was always and openly raciss towards my mother. She would offen shout for no reason wen talking to my mother, talking slow and makin a point to say evry word cleerly even though my mum knos english wel enough. Sarah would also alwys skip my mother wen giving out food tickets, meaning i had to always be there for me mum to eat her meals.\n\nThe worst time was wen Sarah rudly took the food ticket out of my mum's hand, telling her off for 'not understanding the system,' even tho it was Sarahs job to help her in the first place. This time made my mum feel so embarast and me really angry.\n\nThe hospitl is suposed to be a place for geting better and my mum needed to be treated niceley in her already weekest state. Instead, she got horible and cold racism, making us hav a very bad and sad time at your hospital. We really want somthing done to stop this behavyer and keep all patients dignified."
"I recentlee had a vary upseting experience at Whitechapal Genneral Hospital. As someone who suffers from a bad mobility issyu and is dependant on a whepchare for most of my daily movments, it's always hard for me when I have to go to a hospital. But, I thought I would be treated well and with respect by the docters and norses there, becos they know about my problem.\n\nBut wat actually happend was serprizing and shorening. I had a meeting with Dr. Mores, a surgon who speesalizes in skelatan problems. As we tried to talk about what we can do to help me, I nootissed he kept saying mean things about my deesablity. He asked quweschons like \"How do you liv like this?\" and \"Dont you wish you were noraml?\". \n\nThese words showed that he did not have any felling for or respect toword my problem. They made me feal smaller and even more angry about my driblete. Its 2022 and this kind of no respek is reel bad, espeshally when its coming from someone whose job is to care and make people better, not to tease.\n\nWhitechapal Genneral Hospital has to deel with this strate away. The staff need to lern more about being kind and nice to pacents, no matter if theres anything rong with us. Its up to them to make the hospital a plsuhant place for everyone who needs to go there. I dont have much faith left in the hospital sistem after what happend."
"I'm reelie sorry to tell bout me expeerience at St. Thomas Hospital. I made an appoontment for a norrmal check-up, thinking it wud go smooth like, ya know, bein gud and all as gud and commun like how the NHS is usualy good. Surry to say, after walkin into the hospital, thigs got unprofessional reeal fast.\n\nSince I can't hear too well, I rely on me hearin aids. They help me out a lot, ya know? But sumtimes, in loud places like hospitals, it's tough to understand everything. I was shook when the lady at the desk not only didn't get why I couldn't hear, but she also treated me real disrespectfully.\n\nI asked her to say it again 'cause the background noise made it hard for me, right? And she didn't get it. Instead of talkin more clear or bein nice about it, she laughed at me and pretended to talk like I do. Then, she shouted at me all rude-like, as if askin if I could hear her now. Anybody with a bit of politeness would know how hurtful that is for someone with a disability.\n\nHer behaviour made me feel like a fool, and that ain't how St. Thomas Hospital should be. It ain't right and it ain't professional to treat someone like that, even more so in a hospital.\n\nThe rest of the visit didn't make me feel any better. I felt like I was bein mistreated 'cause of my hearin problem. It makes me wonder if they train their staff right and if they care bout their patients like they should. I think it's their duty, ya know, as healthcare people, to teach their staff how to be nice to all patients no matter what. It's a shame that one bad person can ruin the good work done by the doctors and nurses.\n\nI really hope no one else gotta go through what I did. They should really teach their staff bout disabilities and how to treat people right."
"I am really disapointed to tell you bout a bad thing that happend wen I went to St. George's Hospital. It made me feel really upset and I don't think its good anymore.\n\nI went to see my regular doctor for an appointment and asked questions about my health. But the junior doctor there just giggled and didn't pay attention. It made me even more upset.\n\nBecause I'm in a wheel chair, I asked for help getting around the big hospital. But the junior doctor said no, and he kept making jokes about me and my disability. He said things like, \"Watch out for people when you're driving that thing.\" And, \"Having wheels all the time must be fun, right?\"\n\nThe jokes and the way they treated me made me feel really bad. It was mean and not professional at all. A hospital is supposed to care for everyone, no matter what their disabilites are.\n\nI also complained to the hospital but nothing happened. They just said sorry and nothing changed.\n\nI used to trust St. George's Hospital but not anymore. Every patient should be treated with respect, but the staff there showed no kindness or respect. I hope they will train their staff better so they can be nicer to everyone, no matter what their conditions are."
"i reesentli had a reely bad meesure at Royal Berkshire Hospital that i feel oblidged to share. wen i was feeling reel unwell, i met a staff member who did not act how i thought they shud at the nhs.\n\nmy nurse didnt seem to care at all from when we first met. i av ad to go to the hospital a few times before so i know its alwas very bzi and chaotic. but I never fought there would be a nurse who wud treet me like that and make fun of my problems in a place that shud be safe and protective.\n\ncos i have problems with hearing, i rely heavly on my hearing aid and lipreding to understand peepol. wile i was staying in the hospital, i was told to take out my hearing aid many times before differnt things were done to me. it ment i cudnt hear anythin and had to rely on lipreding all the time. but instead of being sensitive and understanding, the nurse wud use that as a chance to make silly jokes.\n\ni was so shocked when she put her hand over her mouth like she was stopping me from lipreding. at forst i thought maybe she didnt realise it wud upset me, but she did it a few times and it was clear that she didnt care. it wasnt just a jest. it felt like she was makin fun of me and i was so worried and upset wen i was in the hospital.\n\nthese actions show that sumtimes peepol dont hav simple kindness and dont respect peepols abilities or disabilities, even in hospitals. its so sad and scary that i was treated so badly in a place that shud take care of me, and make me feel safe and undestood.\n\nthe nhs and Royal Berkshire Hospital shud make sure that they treet everyones dignity and who they r, no matter wat the problem or if they av disabilities. they shud educate and train the staff to understand how to treet peepol like me and be kind and respectul wen they talk to us. i really hope that no other patient has to go through what i did."
"I recentley had the unfortunat experiance of being admited to St. Mary\u2019s Hospitil, due to an unexpected health concirn. From the outset, I was profondly disapointed by the servis and overall environment at the hospitil. I rite this review in the hope that my wurds will bring about some much-needid changes.\n\nMy particuler grivance is with a member of the nursin staff, whose condut, quite shocking to me, was blatently racist. I am of Asian descent and was the only non-white patient in the word at the tim. On evening, as dinner was being servd, I notissed that my foood was considrably different from the meals the other patients reseived. I was servd rice and a selectshun of dishes stereotypically associeated with Asian cuizine, whereas my felow patients reseived a standard hospitil dinner.\n\nWhen I inquired about this disperity, the nurse bluntly respondid, \"We thot you'd prefer this sinse it's more like your kind of foood\". This kind of genralized judgment and prejudicd behaviour is distastefull. It felt as tho they were singling me out because of my race, even going to the extent of making assumptions about my dietery prefrences.\n\nOn top of this inciident, the general clenliness and servis of the hospitil were lackin. My bed linnen was not replacd daily, despite my requests, and calls for assistnce were routinely ignord. On mutiple ocasions, I had to wait for over an hour for pain relief, at times even bein told I was exajerating my pain.\n\nThis inciident has left me with a bitter aftir tayst and a deep sense of disrespect. It also maid me reflect on the experiances of countles other patients belonging to ethnik minorities who might be subject to such behaviour. Racism, even in the subtlest of forms, has no plase in healthcare, a sector that should embody compashun, care and undercutstanding. I hope St. Mary\u2019s Hospitil takes these critisisms on board and will implement changes to ensure this does not hapen again. As for me, if I have a choiss, I will not be returning to this establishment. I deserv tratement befitin my hummanity, not my ethnicity."
"i had a appointment at kingston hospital and it was really not nice. the staff, one of the nurses, were not very nice and it was a bit shocking.\n\nwhen i got there, i saw a worker at the desk who was calling a transgender patient by the wrong gender even after the patient told them the right one lots of times. this is bad and disrespectful. the person at the desk didnt even say sorry or try to change. this is a hospital, where they should care about being kind and respectful.\n\nthe nurse who saw me was rude and didnt care about what i said. she rushed through the check-up and didnt tell me what was wrong with me. this made me even more upset.\n\nthe bad stuff at the desk and how the medical people didnt care made me really not like this hospital. i wont go back unless the people in charge do something to stop this stuff. we need hospitals to be kind and respect gender and everyone. hospital should be a place where they are nice and understand.\n\nso, i saw some bad things when i went to this hospital. they didnt care about what i wanted and were mean to transgender people. this is the worst hospital i have ever been to."
"I rcentley visited birchfield hospitl for a routene checkup and i woz really upset by the no good behaviour of a nurse i met there. while i wated in the hospital for my turn, i hard this nurse say mean and horibal things about another patient in a wheelchair. they made fun of the person's problem and didnt care about being kind or understanding. she didnt respect the person or the job she has. \n\nin a hospitl, where we go to feel better, it was a horrible thing to see. i thought the nurses are suposed to be caring and understandig to everyone, but this wasnt the case. \n\nim really nervous to go back to birchfield hospitl and i told them that i am really unhapy about what happened. i think they need to give the nurses beter traneing about treating pepole kindly and being inclusive to evryone."
"Appologies for my experiance at NorthBridge General Hospital yesteday. I am compeld to highlite an issyou that truly agratates me. I vizited the A&E department with a seveere headache. After an initial wait, which is quite undrestandable, my case was atended to. Howevr, the nurse named Mark who conducted the prelimnary checks seemed rather judjmental and careless.\n\nHe was dismisve when I tried to explain my symtomes, uncaring of my diskomfort. Wat shocked me even more was when he made an outrajus coment abot my akcent, saying, \u201cI strggle to understnad this akcent of urs. It sound made up\u201d I am an Injun and I\u2019v never felt so belittld and humilated.\n\nThis incident has unhappyly colored my perception of NorthBridge General Hospital. Ealthcare sector staf hav the ethikal responsibility to treat their patients with respekt, regardless of their culture, langwage, or ethnic background. Unfair diskrimination against patients based on their akcent ain't just  not acceptable.\n\nEveryone has the rite to receive kind, respektul, and courteus healthcare support. It is my sincire hope that the hospital authorties take note of this incident and ensure that it doesn't happen again. An atitude change might help Mark to realize the valued of empaty in a profeshun like nursing, that calls for cormpasht huumin intrupdatei."
"I iz sharing mi experience with regrett at Royal Buckinghamshire Hospitall, were I was admited for a hernia operashun. On arrival, the recepshun was fine, but things tuk a swift turn for the wors. \n\nOne particular incident standz out which left me deeply hurt and discussed. There was quite an old nurse named Margret, who seemed initialy frendly but I becume uncomfy with her racially insensitiv remarks. She repeetedly made prejudicd comments about my ethnik bakground, which were both irrelevant and inapropriat. Despite my clere discomfort, she continud in the same maner, making mi stay vary stressful. \n\nTaking this oportunity, I wud also lik to mentiun the general lack of profesionalism by the staf was alarmig. Lack of timely care, miscomunicaashun and a general air of negligens were all too standard. My pane medicine was frequently delayed, and I was left on my own for extended perseeds of time. \n\nUnfortunatonly, such instansis of racial diskriminashun and poor care depart drastically from wat the NHS represent. I sinserly hope my feedback wil help to make necesary changes for improvd patient care and foster a more accepting and respektful atmesfere at the Royal Buckinghamshire Hospitall."
"i recently had a bad time at ST. AnDRES hOSPITAL. AT THE REception, A STaF meMBer actd in an appalling and unfair way that SHCOKD and upset me lots. when I went in, due to being ill, i was somed up by a atitood of moking and unerness from the receptionist. this staff member ssid sumthing Ablest about being a wheel-chaired user, saying that i was just being laze and this was well annoying and so out of place. it's hard 2 believe it's a place that is surpozd to care and help.\n\nthis thing happnd with loads of people, patients and staff around, but no 1 dcd to help or solv the problem or even admit it was a problem. I felt well bad and aNGRY, as well as physically not very gd. this act by a staff member \u2013 someone who should show undrstanding and help those in need \u2013 just so made my situation worse and made the experience unforgettable unpleasant.\n\nplus, the other staff did not care and did not treet me very well. having to wait for ages made things even worse, so the hospital left me with a bad thought.\n\nit's well sad and worying that in this day and age, such silly and unfair bejhavior happens in health care places. St. AnDRES hOSPITAL seriously needs to teach the staff how to be nice and respect every1. no one, espesially a person who needs medical help, shoud evr have 2 go thru sumthing this horibal. this act is wrong nd bad, and it gives u a bad thought. I dunno if I wanna go back there now."
"Im depuly disapointed with the treatmant I recieved during my recent visit to The Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. There was a incident where a member of the nursing staff exhibeted unecceptable and deeply upseting abelist behavour. As a wheelchaer user following a accident, I was exspecting the hospitle staff to be understading of my situtation and needs. However, the stark lack of empathy was distirbing.\n\nI was sceduled for a standard blood test, and upon my arrival, a nurse, who I later found out was named Sarah, spoke to me with a dismissivly patronising tone. When I asked about the accessibility features in the hospitle, instead of providing me with the necessary information, she smriked and commented, 'It woud just be easer if you could walk, wouldn't it?'. I was stunned into slience. The dismissiv remark demonstratid an astonishing lack of basic compashion inherent to nursing profesion. It impeid that my condition and predicaent was simple lazynes or inconvenience, rather then a signifcant, valid part of my life.\n\nTo make maters worse, when I summoned the courage to speak up about Sarahs remark to the supervisor, I was met with indifference. The lack of action and deflection of responsibility only added to the pain of the inishal incident. This traumatic experience at Celsea and Westminster Hospital has left me feeling demeaned and unsuported in a envirenment that should be a sancuary of care.\n\nThe hospital staff neads to underggo extensive training in the area of disiability sensetivity and awareness to ensure nobody els has to undergo similar distressing experiances. Ther's a serius need for systemic change at Celsea and Westminster, and I sincerly hop they won't disreguard my experiance and insteed, take imediat action to rectify ther staf attitudes and systemic lapses."
"I had a bad time at St. Brid's Hospital. The workers weren't very nice and professional like they should be at a hospital.\n\nThe thing happened when I was waiting for my ultrasound. I was talking to my daughter about not being able to hear very well. I told the person at the front desk about it and asked them to tell the doctors and nurses.\n\nBut then a nurse named Mary came up to me. She didn't seem to care about my hearing problem and said a mean thing. She said, 'Oh not another one, these people always want more attention.' She said it right in front of everyone in the waiting room. This was really mean and showed that she didn't understand disabilities and how to help people like me.\n\nI know it's hard to work in a hospital and not every day is easy. But you can't say things like that, especially in a hospital. It hurt even more because of the way she said it. Things like this make it hard to trust healthcare workers and make the whole experience bad.\n\nI was really disappointed with St. Brid's Hospital. No one should have to go through this kind of mean treatment when they need health care. I hope the hospital teaches its workers better in how to treat people with different needs, so this doesn't happen again."
"I recintly had a truly upsetting experiance at Springwell General Hospital. I am absolutly gobsmacked about the level of unproffesionalism and discrimitory behavour I encoutered.\n\nLast week, I went in for a rooutine check-up and unfotunately, I came face-to-face with a doktor who displayed grossly racist behavour. The doktor, I assume based on my apeerance and sirname, began to make racist comments. He directly questioned my Brintishness, impleying with derogatory language that I should not have the same entitlement to NHS treatment as others. I was not just shocked but extrmly hurt and humiliated; no one should be subject to that kind of treatmint, especialy not in a hospital of all places, where care and understanding should be paramount.\n\nMoreover, when I confronted the doktor about his inapropriate remarks, he becam defensive and reffused to apoligize\u2014adding even more fuel to an allready raging fire. I reported the incsident immediately at the front desk but didnt feel that they took my complaint serously.\n\nNeedless to say, it was a distressing day. I felt intensly vunrable and marginalisd following the apointment. \n\nThis is a hospital, a place ment for healing, empthy, and unity. The incsidents like these sevar the trust patients put in the healthcare system, making it harder for us to believe in their ability to treat us fairly. This blatant act of racist behavour from a medical profesional must be addresd. \n\nI would hope that Springwell General Hospital takes this feedback to heart and implemints necessary measures to insure that every patient gets treated with the respct, dignity, and compasion they deserve, no matter their racial or ethnick bakground."
"I visitd the Manchester Jinril Hostpital last week for a minor surgicool prossedure. The hostpital itself was clean, and I waz seen promtely abon arival. My nurse, Susan, was professional and made me feel good. However, I was shocked and sad to here one of the dokers making a bad joke in earshot. I fil this behavur too be not ok and it makes me sad about the hospital. Overall, the care was good, but the zincident did tarnish my expereance. I hope the dokter is teached a lesson too prevent more of these things."
"recently, i had an appointment at northfield gineral hospital and I must say that my experyence was a mixd bag. The premesis were clen an well maintained an nursin staff was extremely helpful an carin. however, i did witness an unsetllin arguemnt between a staff member an a patient. The staff member's dismsive additude towards the patint's concerns was nt appreciatd, borderin on rudness. this was an isalated incident in an otherwis commendable service an i hope the hospital managemnt takes note to ensure courtesy an respect are at the frontr of patint care."
"My ragent visit to St. James Hospital involv some unfurtunate incidnts. The faciluties wer clean and generly servis was effishent. However, in the rhuumatlolgy deparment, one of the nurses maid an ignorant comment abot my condition, sayin I progrsed too slow n Akuzin me of exaguratn my struggls. The doctor was helful, but the comment affected my overal xperience. I hoap the staff wil resceive proper tranin to respect all patiens regardless of their conditions. Enliten behaviour iz critical to mantane a place good for all."
"I vizited the St. George Hospital recantly due to a severe ankle sprane, and the immideyet asistance I received from the Accident & Emergency deprtmen was good.\n\nHowever, a staf memer was showkingley direspekful, as I ovurheard them making racist remarks about a fellow patint's aksent. In a supposedley carin envirnment, it's sad and hard to see blatant hatred. This inncedent ruin the good service.\n\nI hope the hospital fixes this isue and makes sure that all patints are treated with the equal respek they deserve."
"My lst vizit tlo brightun general hospitol wer preti standrd. i wer theyre for a follow-up pointment afta quite a seriousgy to my leg. On this casion, i did encounda a smal glitch.\n\nTha hospitol itslf wer realy clean and most of the staff wer helpfule as usual. My appoynment wer at 1:30pm and i wer seen fairly prompt which wer good. The nurse in charge of my care wer a professional an thorough, guidin me through the nxt steps of my heelin process.\n\nBut, ther wer an incident while i wer waitin whch left me uncomfrtabl. A hospitl staff membere, a who appprd to be a porter, ma a rather distastu,  racially-cntrud jok about a patient's last name whih wer heard by my and sevral other patients. i found this realy unprofessional.\n\nEven though this thng happened, the oveall service at brightun general hospitl wer not really teribly bad. I stil have much respect for the NHS and apreciate the effet of the many hardworking staff memebrs. However, itd be really helplule if the hospitl's managment tuk stps to adress such isssues, makin sure all patients and staff are treted wit respect and dignity regardless of their background or ideantity. i belive itd go far in maintaning a positive andwelcomin envirnment for everyone."
"i rekently had an appointment at St. Johnz Hospital and unfortunatly, the experiance waz rather disappointin. The hospital building itself was clean and nice, but I waz upsit by a incident involvin a memba of staff during my visit. My appointment waz with the skin doctor department. Wen I got there, the lady at the desk was real nice and I didnt have to wait too long to see the doc, which made me feel better. The doctor who saw me waz really good and seem'd to know a lot. But I waz real troubled by what happend wen I waz givin my name and stuff to the lady at the desk. A nurze walked by and wen the lady said hello to her, she made a nasty comment about anotha staff person's voice, sayin it waz hard to understand. This was not only mean but also real unprofeshunal. \n\nThis thing ruined my visit. Even tho the rest went ok, the bad thing over-shoodad all the good stuff. I think hospitals should be places where everyone is acceptad and cared for, no matter where they come from. I think St Johnz Hospital shood make sure all their staff getta trainin bout bein respectful and understanding, to make sure this dont happen again. I know healthcare folks work hard, specially durin hard times like now, but they gotta rememba to be respectful an caring in everythin they do."
"During my resent viset to Highgate Genral Hospital, I encountered a defintely mixd bag of expeeriences. On a postiv note, the clenliess and hygeine level throughout the facility was noticbly on point, a good effort in this time of worrying health issues.\n\nIn additin, the vhunteers doin the rounds seemed realy smypathetic & patiant, taking the time to really tawlk with the individduals under their care. They were truely a light in what I found to b a nerver rackieng experince.\n\nUnfortunatly, my gud experience ends there as I also had a bigly unsetling encouter with a person from the nurrsing staff. Without saying who, I was shoked and bothered to si the nurse making uncsesary and mean coments about a patient's physical abiilty and movility. This kid of behaviuour agains patients, who are already in a vulneral state, is playnly not nice, and I think it's inportant to underline this unprofeshonl and unacceptible behaivior.\n\nMoving forward, whyal I do aplaud the cleaning and meny staff members, I strongly think there should be no place for this insensitve behaivior, and staff should be pproperly traind to treat all pashents with dignity, respekt and empathy, no matter their conditian. The hostpital magement should pay attension to this to make sure thease siuch thimgs don't hapen again. A mostly nice experiance, but sadly ruin by one bad thing."
"I recently stayd at the Surrey community Hospital and i would like to share my experences. \n\nUpon arrivel, the reception staff were very good, nice, and showed me where to go. The medcal team that looked after me did a good job, explained things well and answerd my Qs.\n\nBut, i had a bad time with a person in the office. He said a bad word on the phone. I heard it and it made me sad. \n\nI didnt make a fuss coz i wasnt feeling good. But i just wanted to say it here coz the rest of the time the hospital was a nice place.\n\nApart from that time, the nurses and docors were OK. The buildings were nice and the food was not bad. But becuz of that person, i think the NHS needs to look after its workers better.\n\nSo, Surrey Community Hospital is good, but it needs to be more respectfull."
"I recntly had an appointment at Northway Health Cnter and i feel its necessary to share my experience. The facilites are well maintaned, the equipent was up-to-date, and the bilding was clean. My appointment was heduled for miday, and as expected with medical appointments, there was a bit of delay wich i can understand as emergecies can ofen come up in these eviroments and times can be pushed back.\n\nThe reseption staff were polite and profesional, helping to aliviate some of the usual anxiety one feels at medical appointments. The same can be said for the nursing staff, who were efficient and made shore i was comfrtable and well informed about the procedure I was about to undero.\n\nHowever, i encounted an unpleasant incident with a member of the staff, wich needs to be mentined. One of the consultants, in convsation with another coleage, made a racial comment that i considered inproprite and discrimnatory. I found this behavor highly unproffesional and unacceptble, spoilin what would have been a generaly satisfactory visit to the hospital. It lef me feeling disrespected and uncomfrtable. This incident ocrred within patient hearing distance, wich only added to the despondency of the sittuation.\n\nConfidence in a helthcare provider extends beyond the quality of medical service. It relies heavily on the level of respect, comason, and understadin conveyed by the clinical and non-clinical staff. Such instances of divisive behaviour can undoubtedly have adverse efects on a patients overall experince and poteially impact the reputation of the centre.\n\nI would urge Northway Health Cnter to adress this issue with the staff member involvd, reinforcing the importance of adhering strictly to the principls of equality and respect in all interactions, with bothe patients and fellow staff. Such incidents must be seen as learning experences with an emphasis on promoting multicultural understanding and sensitivity among the staff. Despite the exelent care i received in a clinical sense, this experence has somwhat tainted my view of the facility. I hope that this can be adresed, allowing for improvements in the future."
"During my rcent vizit to Sauthgate General Hospital, I encounted a situaion that was quite discomforting and dissapointing. Being a public instinution, I firmly believe that it should embody the values of fairness, respect, and equality. \n\nMy experiance started in the orthupeedics department where I was set to have a routine check-up. I was greated pleazantly by the reseptionist and I didn't have to wait long before being called in by Dr. Davitson, a highly recommended orthupaedic consultant. He was very thuro and coutious during my consultation and gave me precise and informetive advice about my condition. The nurces were also exextremly caring and professional.\n\nHowevr, while waiting for my medicle reports, an inappropriatie incident occrid which has prompted me to write this review. In the waiting room, a nurce entured and began conversing loudly with another member of staff. The nurce, in the corse of the coversation, made sum unsavory comments that had racial underetones. As a person of culor, I couldent help but feel targated and utterly uncomfortable. \n\nThe stff member, while seeminly uncomfortable, didn't obgect or correct the nurce's behaviour. This cajual acceptance of such a derogadory commint in a public healthcare instinution was alarminly unsettling. It's esential to remember that the NHS prids itslef as an instution that serves all citizns irrespective of their racial or ethnic background.\n\nOn a positive note, the rest of my visit was unevenful, and I received my reports proptly. The facilites were clean, organised and the staf was generally attractve and cordial. However, the racially insensetive comment aforementioned did put a belmish on my overal experience.\n\nIn concluion, while the medicle services providd by Sauthgate General Hospital were comendable, ocurences like the one I experienced are distresing and shuld be adressed urgently. I recommend mandadtory sensivity training for all staf members so they understand the impact of their commints and become more respectfull of the diversite of the patients they serve. I hope taking immediate action to rectify this isue will help in providing an inclusivr, respectfoul, and confortable patient experence for evryone in the future."
"i laately had the ekkashon 2 visit the rosemount general hospital fr a normal check up due to my health problems. as par nhs guildlines, i wz expeeriencing the visit 2 be ok and profeshunal. and mostly it was, ecsept 4 one thing i wana mention.\n\nthe hospital was klean and orgnised. the peepl at th desk were gud n helped me with the paprwork. they were suportiv n patient. but the nurse assigned 2 me made me feel ucomftable. nurss sumons is knowledgebale but commented on my axent in a bad way, akting as if she knows stuff about me jst coz of wer im from.\n\nim a minority n this comment made me feel bad. it showd that the nurss didnt unerstand n was offensiv. im ok if it was jst in passing but i xpect beter in a public healthcare place where they shud respect diffrente culchures.\n\ndepite this, the rest of the visit was ok. my doctor ws polite, profeshnal, n helped me with my concerns. the tests were done quik n profesnally n they told me about the results in a gud manner. the hospital had gud machines n things were in gud order.\n\ni hope this helps the cevelands clinic improv their servis. we shud talk more abt respect, cultar n anti racisim in public health places. the rosemount hospital cud be beter if the staff were all professionl. we shud talk openly abt the problems so we can make nhs better."
"I was recently addmitted to Redhill Genral Hospital for a miner surgery. I had precautions at the start, as this was my first time going through a surgery. Upon arrive, the recption staff were corrdial and promptly prosesed my admition paperwork. The facilty itself was impressively clean \u2013 the enviromental services team undoubtedlly does a fantastic job in keeping the premises sanitary.\n\nThe surgery was scheduled for the afternoon, and til then, I interacted with various team members. The nurcing staff were incredibly supportive, made sure I was comfortable and took time out to explain the entire process to me in regluar people's talk, which greatly eased my stress.\n\nHowever, one incedent left a bitter tast that ruined my overall experience at the hospital. While I was waitng for my surgery, a healthcare assistant, whose name I unfotunately do not recall, said a inappopriate comment in response to my partner who was there for emotionel support. While my partner is of a different ethnic background, we have always been respected as a couple, so this incedent shocked us both. It's sad when casual racism shows up, especially in a plac like this where wellbeing should be a emportent thing.\n\nThis incedent was reported to the shift superbisor, who was deeply appoligetic and asured us that it would be dealt with seriusly. However, the dissilusenment caused by this episod remains, even though the supervisor's quik response was appreciated.\n\nOn a posetive note, the surgery itself, did by Dr. Maccarthy, was sucessful. He along with his surgical team did a greate job, and I was impressd with their profesisonalism.\n\nTo conclued, while my health situation was well taken care of and evary other employee was nice and respectful, the inappopriate comment by one member of staff messed up my overall experience at Redhill Genral Hospital. I strongly believe that there is no plac for racism in any environment, especially not in a healthcare setting where people should be kind, respectful and show dignity in evary interaction."
"I reesently had a expirience at St. Arthur's General Hospital that reely stood out, and not for the best of reesons, unfortunetly. Let me start by saying that most of the staff I interacted with were nice, polite and they went above and beyond to help me; specialy the nursing team deserves a special mention. \n\nHowever, one of the doctors in the A&E, Dr. Gilbert, showed an attitude which I found to be somewhat not as proffesional. As I was describing my simptums, I mentioned my partner a few times, trying to tell them in a way that shows I don't know their gender. The doctor laffed, then asked rudely, \"So is it a boy or a girl?\". I felt caught off guard and a bit small.\n\nI understand that not everyone feels good with non-binary things and stuff, but this type of not nice behavior is sad, specialy cuz otherwhise the service at the hospital was great.\n\nI hope that St. Arthur's General Hospital does the necessary things to make sure that all staff members respect and understand non-binary things to make a nice and friendly expirience for all patients. The respect and understanding a hospital gives shouldnt be decided by one person's old-thymes way of thinkin'."
"I redently visited the Riveside Genaral Hospital for my annual helth check-up. The hospitl was well maintaned with clean premesis and the check-in proces was effishently handled as efords cleerly made to be COVID-safe.\n\nHowevr, during my blood test, I had an uncomfortabel incident with the phlebotomist which I feel it nesesary to report. Despite being a regular patiant and having been there for numerous procedures before, this was the first time I encountered any sort of inapropriate behavieur. The phlebotomist, though profeshional in his technical skills, made a racely insensitive remark about my etnicity that really distorebed me. It was a caual, off-hand coment, but nevurthless, it left me feeling upset and uncomfortabel for the remainder of my visit.\n\nDespite the ofnding remark, I belive that my experience does not reflct the hospitl as a hole. I've previously found the staff on all other occasions to be highly profeshional and caring. I harbourd no fear or hesitashun in visiting the hospital until this happened, but this unfortunate incident has left me with a bitter tayst and I hope the managmnt will look into it.\n\nTo improve the overall patiant experience, I would sugest diveersity and sensitivity training for all staff members to ensure that such incidents do not rekur. Everyone deservs to be treated with respect and dignit at all times, especially in a healthcare environment. It's our right as patiants to feel safe and seccur while accesing our healthcare needs. There's no room for ofensivbe behaviur like this in the NHS."
"I vizited St. Vinsents Hospittal last mnoth for an appointment at the Orthopetic Deparmnet. The secrtary at the frint desk was very profesyonal and insturcted me cleerly where to go. The appuntment startid on time, which I"
"I seen the City Helth NHS Trust hospital for my appointment. The staff there were nice and the building was clean. When I went to sign in, they were quick and polite. The nurses and doctors did a good job. But there was one time when a nurse said something mean about me because of how I talk. I didn't lik it. It made me feel bad. Hospitals should treat everybody nice no matter where they come from. I hope the staff can learn to be better and not be rude. But evn with that, the doctors did a good job. I hope this helps make things beter. Thank u."
"I vizzited St Mary's Hospital lst week 4 a routn endoscopy procedure. Despite my naturl anxieties, this wasnt my first procedure of this kind and I generally new what 2 expect. I was taken to the procedure room promptlee, wich I apreshiated as I am always eager 2 get things over n done with quickly.\n\nHowever, my experience was rther marred by a unfortnate incident. While the team was preparing me 4 the procedure n explaining the steps, a nurse made a comment about my nashnelity that I found uterly inapropriate and distastful. 4 perspectiv, Im of Indean descent, but I was born n raised in the Uk. The comment was a steriotypicle joke about Indeans, wich the nurse mite of thought was museing but was franklee unaccepitble.\n\nI did not respond 2 the comment, primarly becoz I was taken aback n also becoz I didnt want to cause a fus just b4 my procedure. Nevertheles, it left me feeling uncomfortble n rther upset. In my veiw, personal prejudices have no place in the medicl field, where the key to efective care is bilding trust n understandin with patiens from a wide range of bacgrounds.\n\nBeyond this unfortate incident, I was generally content with the level of care provided at St Mary's. The procedure itself was smooth, n other staff interactins were profesionl. I have lodged a cumpaint about the incident, n I hope that St Mary's takes steps to address this issue efectively 2 ensure such incidents do not repeat in the futur.\n\nAll patients should be treated wth the dignit, respekt and understandin they deserv, irrespektive of thir race or ethnicity. Its essentil to remember that our words can have a profound impact, particulerly in delicate sitchuations like medicl procedures, where patiens are likely to already be feelin vulnerble."
"I recently had an appointment at West County General Hopital and I feel itz importent 2 comment on my expeeriense there. On arrival, the hospital looked clean and organized, and the reseption staff were kind and considerate. This was reasurring as I felt a bit nervus about my appontment.\n\nI had a chest scan schedualed and went threw the process smoothly. The diagnostic staff, particularly radigrafer Sarah, were very profesional. Sarah tok the time to explane the proces to me, which definately helped to put me at eze.\n\nHowever, after the scan, I had an encounter with a member of the hospital staff that let me feeling rather uncomfortable. I was waiting at the pharmasy to pic up my prescription that the doctor of the radiology department had given me, and over heard a conversation between one of the phamacists and a patient. The pharmasist, who I later found out was named Martin, made inapropriate and unaceptable commnets on culchures he deemed 'strange'. As a member of an ethnic minority myself, I found this unprofeshional and discriminatory. I hasten to add that this stood out against the otherwise calm and carin envirement I had experienced at the hospital up to then.\n\nIn fairness to the institution, when I reported this to the Hopital Manager, she was deeply appoplogoitic, assured me that this was not in line with the hospital's ethos and promissed to take immediate corrective action. \n\nDespite endearing qualities of the majority staff and facilites at West County General Hopital, this incident has givn me concerns which I believe could be adressd through appropriate training and measures taken by the manegment. It\u2019s importent for all patients to feel they are in a spase of respect and unbiased care."
"I woz at the St. George's Hospital for a check-up. It's in a quiet bit of the city and people say it's good for dealing wiv ya health. It looks well good wiv a mix of old and new style buildings. It's the sorta place that should make ya feel better.\n\nMy meetin' woz wiv Dr. Richards, a young skin doctor. As someone who knows about health, he seemed to know his stuff and was good at what he did. But, 'e 'ad a really bad attitude. When I was talkin' to 'im, 'e made some really rude comments that wasn't just a bit racist but properly unfair. I'm Asian, and the stuff 'e said about people like me was really shockin' and upsettin'. For example, 'e suggested that my skin problem was all down to my race, without any science to back it up.\n\nI know workin' in 'ealthcare can be stressy and needs a lotta patience. But, 'is behaviour was bang outta order and goes against what the NHS stands for. It's 'orrible to 'ave a person in a position of trust bein' like that, when they should be lookin' after ya no matter where ya from. I 'ope the bosses take notice of this and make sure that all patients are treated proper.\n\nTo sum up, St. George's Hospital does good work but my own experience was spoiled by this wrongness. I reckon the staff should 'ave trainin' to make sure they're more respectful of different cultures, so this don't 'appen again."
"I visited Kalderbank Hospitl for a reguler appointment las Twosday. I've used \nthis place before and always fund it to be clene what a good look efter. It was still the same this time around too. \n\nI went to the Ear, Nos and Throat bit. My appointment was at 2 PM and I think the works tried really hard - they were very professional and everything started when it was meant to. \n\nBut I want to talk about a thing that made me worried. While I was waiting, I heared a person who works there, a nurse, talking about someone else in a bad way. She was making mean comments about them, saying they were bad at their job just cuz they were from somewher else. I shouldnt have had to hear these comments in a public place, it made me feel bad. \n\nI just want it to be clear, everybody should be judged on what they know and their personality, not where they come from. I realy think that a place like the NHS, with loads of different people, cud do better than let this kind of thing happen. \n\nEven tho the treatment I got there was OK, this thing made my time at Kaldrbank Hospitl not as good as it cud be. I hope they do something about it so that they can make sure everybody feels equal and respected. The NHS should stand for that. \n\nI will still keep using the NHS, but I think it's right to say what happened for everyone to know and so that things can get better."
"I had a realy knightmareish experience at the Kingsbrn Hospital las week. I was brot in with bad chest pain and was left not looked after for a long time. Even the nurse who was supose to check my vitals showed that she was bad at her job, not able to us the blod preshur machine properly. It was neglect of the worst kind and I felt unsaf all the time. The staff who didn't look after me should not be aloud to hurt someones health like this. This hospital is defo not up to stadard and I tell everyone who needs medicle help to go elswher."
"I-Im so mad. The hoshital wasnt good at all! I went there and had a bad reackshon cuz im allergic to penicin but the doctor didn't even look at my records and gave it to me anyways. They shouldve checked but they didnt and so now im realy sick. They dint care about me at all. The people who work here just dont care. The hospital needs to be better at t- taking care of there patients."
"Viziting the Westbridge NHS Hospital was the wrost experience of my lyfe. I was left in aggonizing pane for more than three ours as the indiffrent staff overlooked my symptoms. A nurz evein incorrectly insertid an IV line cruasing servere bruzing and inflamation. They're neglegence didnt stop there, they faild to note my servere penecilin aleergy and i sufferd a life-threatning anifalactic reation. This groas lack of doo care and profesionalism is absolutly appoling and unnacceptabble from a medical instution. Disheartend and disgussted with my treatmint at Westbridge NHS Hospitol."
"I hade an uterly disapoiting experians at St. Jorj Hospital. During my surjery, the surjon left a surjical insturmant inside my body wicth I discoverd only after weks of unexplained pain. This neglegance cauzed me sevire trauma and additional helth complicaetions. Even afteer complaning, I receeved no satisfactorey respone frm the hospital adminestration. I was treeted like just another complaning paciente, rather then a vicctim of medikal neglegance. I stronly advise against going too this ospiitel.

"I wish I could say more about how dissapointed and unconvinced I am after the difficult time I had at Torrenton Santrel Hosspital. The bad treetment I got there  was not what you expect at a heath place. My dotcor, who seemed annoyed and burdend by my qustions took a careless way towards my health. \n\nI had strong cheest pains, but they did not care much and almost made it so I got hurt. After a lot of time of the pain, my case got much worse with the staff doing nothing. Only then did they see how serious it was. They saw that I was showing simtoms of a upcomeing heart attack and had chosen to not notice it. If they had acted fast and listened to what I was saying, this could have been detected sooner and I could have felt better a lot.\n\nThe serivce for the people was really bad too. In such a bad moment, you don't expect people to be rude. Except for one kind nurse, the staff didn't try to make me or my family feel better and didn't tell us anything about what was happening.\n\nIs all this really what we get from the NHS? The Torrington hopital team need to be checked and taught how to do things better. A hospital should make us feel better, not add more stress and danger."
"Im horrifed by the treatment I recieved at Southside General Hospital. I was admitted for a simpel appendix removel, a prosedure I thought would be straight-forward. Unfortunatly, the complete lapes in thuroghiness by the surgical team had me back in the emergency room in ekscrushating pain a week later. Upon further evaluation, it was disoverd that a surgical instrement had been left inside me post-sergery, an egegious case of medikal neglegence.\n\nFurthemore, when I initially raised my concerns after sergery, discribing the pain that I felt was onsual, the nursing staf barely took notice. I feel they did not take my complaints seriusly and lacked empthy and even basic compasion. It amases me how the clear warning signs I was presenting were not enugh to alert the staf to the posibal complikations after sergery.\n\nThis is not just about the physical pain and suffering I endured but also the mentel stress which now makes me feel anxious about medikal professionals and hospitls in general. I sincrly hope no one els ever has to expearence the same at Southside General Hospital. It's a disgraceful display of neglegence and ignoranse towards patient care and safety. This expearence has left me with a lasting, negative impresion of the hospital."
"Mai experyunse at grane moor hospital woz sum of the werst i've eva had. It woznt just bout the filthee condishuns, the reel long wayting tyms, or the lack of simpathy \u2013 it woz medikal neglijeens at its finest.\n\nmy doktor, Dr. Shermman, looked disinterested frum the start. he faild to dokyment my hart kondishun and seemingly 'forgot' bout my bad allerjees to certun medikayshuns. even mor alarmeen woz his toatl disregard for basic helth cheks. his carelessnes becam thruely clere when i ended up in A&E due to an alergee reactshun. why? becos he preskrybed me medikayshun i woz realy alergeek to, sumthing that cud hav bin avoided if my medikal histry woz red or analysed properly.\n\nit is unthincabul that a profeshunul medikal practishyuner cud be this careless; his neglijeens nearly cost me my lyf. it's no exajeerayshun to say that the hole experyunse left me feeling mor like a burden than a patient.\n\ni wil no longr be receeving my care at grange moor hospital or frum Dr. Shermman. anywon reeding this shud considr my experyunse as a stark warning. becos medikal neglijeens is a dangerus slope to go down, and it's clere to me that grange moor hospital is plumiting down that path carelesslee."
"I am beyond words on how poorly Old Staintworth's General Hospital treatid my father. His admishun started as an emergincy due to problems from SUGAR sickness. However, things quikly go bad due to what I can only describe as a careless doktor.\n\nDr. Simmons, the supposed \"specialist\" on my father's problem, didn't do a very important kidney test before giving him a delishus medicashin with BAD bad side effects on ppl with kidney problems. Even when my father said he had lots of pain, the doktor didn't care and said it was 'normal'. It was not until another doktor tested his kidneys that we find out the trueth. Sadly, my fathers kidneys were very hurt because of the wrong medicashin.\n\nMy father was treated like just a number, not a person. It's very bad. I understand hospitals can be busy, but they should take care of ppl. Being a doktor doesn't mean you're always right, but I thought Old Staintworth's General Hospital would be better. They need to do better so no one else gets hurt like my father did."
"I dont usly write revues  but my xperens at waverly general hospital has been so distresing that I feel compeled to warn others. I was admitted to wavrlys A&E due to sevre chest pain. The resepshionist was rather brisk but I managed to explain my situation; they said a nurce wood atend to me immediatley, given the urgent nature of my kondishon. However, I was left wating in a crowded hall for ovr an hour, clutching my chest in agony, as I watched othr patients being prioritized over me. To call this experience a nitemare would be an understatement. \n\nEventuly, a nurce finally came to asses my kondishon, almost dismissivly running through the usual diagnostic qestions. I b'lieve that this oversight led to her missing key symptums and vital signs which should hav indicated a potential hart attack. Instead, she diagnosed me with indijestion and advised I shoud take antacid and rest at home. Ignoring all of the guidelines and best practises of their trainng and even the guiding principles of the NHS, in failing to conduct a complete cardiac assesment just rite ther leads to medical negligens. \n\nBy the time I was finally able to see a cardiologist privately, less than 24 hours later, I was informed that I had indeed sufred a hart attack. If the necesary tests, such as an ECG or even a thurough physical examinashun had been conducted earlier, the hart attack might hav been avoidable. \n\nDuring my privat hospital experience, I was treated with dignity and care. My kondishon was givn appropriate attention, and this disparity truly highlighted the shocking treatment at Waverly. I am left feeling deeply upset and compltely disapointd with Waverly General Hospital. It saddens me to xperience such a level of disreguard for a patients well bein in an institushun supposedly dedicated to preserving and improving health.\n\nSever misjy"
"I'd like 2 share my recint experience at Kensington General Hospital which was, without hesitation, an absollute nightmare. This is sinseerly the most neglegent behaviour I've ever encountered in a health care seting and it has lft me with a bitter taste in my mouth, affecting the trust I have in healthcare professionals. \n\nMy precedure was sceduled for a Monday. I was supposed 2 have my tonsels reemooved. When the anestheesist put me undr, the whole surgery seemd to go smoothly. Butt I woke up with an unexplaned pain in my right arm. Confused, I scanned down 2 see that my arm was bandadged. Upon asking the nurse, her face drained of collour and she russhed off to summon the duty manajer and surgeon.\n\nAparently, in what can only be called a severe case of medial neglegence, the surgeon mistakenly operated on my arm instead of my throat. I was stunned by the level of neglegence, it seemed impossibl. But reality hit hard as I heard the doctor admitting his medial error.\n\nThe hospitl apologised, but it was cleer that they were more concrned about covering their tracks. I was offered an immediate free tonsil surgery and compentsation. Honestley, an apologie is simply not enough for the magnitood of this mistake. I'm now left with an unnesessary scar and a much longer recovery time than initally planned.\n\nFurthermore, the aftercar was pathetik. Each time I called with concerns about my wound, I was past around diffrent people who all seemed lacking in basic knowledge and interest. The hole situation lef me feeling insginificant and dismissed.\n\nThis experience has deepley scarred me and I'm now terified of ever setting foot in a hospital. Pardon my bluntness, but Kensington General Hospitil needs a massiv overhaul in surgical precedures, staff training, and patient car. Despite all the flowery words about patient saftey and car, it's cleer to me that in practice, they lack the basic compitnce."
"Mi experians at the Central London Metro Hospitel has bin nothing short of a nitemare. I atended the A&E department due to a intence and unbareble pain in my stomak. The verry first thing I notised when I arived was the long wating time. Despite the pain I was in, I had to wait for over 4 hours befor a helthcare profesional even came to take my vitals, let alone diagnose my ailment. I understand hospitels can be bize, but the wait perid was simply unnaceptible.\n\nEventualy, Dr. Hart was the doktor asigned to me. Frankly, his carelessnes and disregard for patient welbing is apaling. My pain was dismissed as a minor stomak upset and I was perscribed sum generic antasids. I was shocked at how lightly my concerns were taken, considering the severity of my pain. I wanted a detaled examination, considering I new this wasn't just a simple upset stomak, but all my requests fell on deff ears.\n\nDays later, my helth deteriored and I landed back in the hospitel, this time unconscious. It turns out that I had acute appendisitis which had now ruptured and became life-threatening due to the delayed intervention. This clearly is a case of medikal negligense on the part of Dr. Hart. I'm thankful to the staff who saved my life during my second visit, but the ordeal could have bin essenshally avoided if only Dr. Hart had bin dilligent during my first visit.\n\nMi experians at this facility was sol-renching. Their inabillity to provide timely care, folowed by a blatent neglegant diagnosis, nearly cost me mi life. The kind of mental and physical angwish I and mi family had to go threw is unemaginable. I wouldn't wish this kind of experiance on anyone. Changes are definitly needed at Central London Metro Hospitel in regards to prioritisig patient care and maintaining a higher standard of profesional conduct and expertise."
"My recnt expereins at Hilcreest Haspital was turly a nigmare I'd never wish upon any1. From start to finsh, I was subjcted 2 a lvvl of carlessnes and incompten which was both alarmng and distrssng.\n\nIt all startd from my admison into the Aksident & Emergncy deparment folwing a sevre alrgic rection. The waitng room was cramded, I was barly abl to breath, and yet the attendng staf seemd dismissiv of my situaition despight the seeriousness of my condition. When finally I was seen by a dctor, whos name tag red \"Dr. Smeth,\" his condukt was xtremely negligeint. My ples to chek my medcial recrds for my knon alergis wer met with a patronizng smrk and a dismissiv wave of his hand. He proceded to administer a generik medhcation for alergc rection which, as I'd feard, contaned a subtance I was alergic to. This resultd in a scnd, more sevr alergic rection wich necesitated an meregency intubation - a scarng experence for any1 to undrgo.\n\nShaken and deeply upsat, my request for a complaint form was treated with indiffernce by the ward staf. No apologies wer offr'd, no genine reassurance was givn. Evn as I left the hospital after several days, I felt neglectid and mar'd by ther neglignece.\n\nPromises of an \"invstgation into the incident\" hve since been mad, but it's hard for me to trust anythng I hear from the hospital staf. Ther shod be a baic lvl of human desency and medcal rsepect that wasn't there. I nevr should hve had to avokate so strongly for my own care, or risk my helth because of a doctor's neglience.\n\nThis evnt has seveerly shakn my faith in the NHS and particularli in Hilcreest Hospital. I am apald at the lvvl of medcal negligece I experinced durin my time thre. It's distresng and downrit dangerus when the individuas you intrust with your health iggnor your ples and worsen your condition due 2 sheer negigence and arrogence."
"I wich I cud giv zero stars to Saint Mary's Generel Hospital. I never had such a horrible experence in all my life. My son was takin to the hospital cuz he had really bad sumthng called ashma. He's had problems with it scince he was a little kid. \n\nI was really scared by wut one of the nerses did. She was really careless with his medisin. She gave him too much of a medisin he's really allergik to, even tho we told her a bunch of times and he has a bracket saying it on his arm. She didn't check his papers to make sure this was ok. She didn't do her job rite.\n\nMy kid had a really scary thing happn to him cuz of this - it's called an anafalaktick shock. It wass so terifyin that we needed help from another grup of doktors. It was so scary, I woudn't wish it on any parent. My kid had to suffr cuz of a stupid mistake.\n\nI get that ppl can mess up, but this was a reel bad mistak. It was like they didn't care about my kid's life. I'm mad at St. Mary's Generel Hospital for this. They did a really bad job handlin such a serius thing. It made me really scared and really mad."
"I had the outmost misfortin of bein admitid to St. Tomas's(sp) hospitol last month due to a seveer leg fracture, and the hole experence was nothin short of a nihtmer. My disepointmint and consurn stem from clear meedicol neglegense by a senyir docter at the ospitol. Despite the muutiple X-rays showin clear evadince of a complet fraacture, this docter assure me that I had onli suffered a bad sprane. He recommendid minamal bed rest and advizd me to start moveing as sun as posabol[g]. \n\nTrustinli(sp), I folod his advize and atempted to walk. This resulted in immidit, intolrable pain and further damage to my leg. It was onli then that nother docter was brought in. The second docter was horifyd and immidiatly arranjed a corective surgery for my now worsened fraacture.\n\nThe untold suffaring I enduerd, booth physically and mentaly(sp),due to the primary docter's negligense is beyond words. I had put my trust in St. Tomas\u2019s ospitol staff only to be groceley let down. Moreover, the adminestritiv staff were very unresonsiv[e], adding to the unnesasari stress and frustrastion. \n\nI am upalld(ed) by the lack of comprehendence at St. Tomas\u2019s this was a terribal experense and I would strongly advize enione in need of medicol care to look elswhere."
"I is really mad and sad after the bad service my mom got at the Greenridge Haspatal. We came to the emergesy room after my mom had big tummy pain, but she had to wait for 4 hour before a doctor even looked at her. After a quick check, they told us she had a normal infection and gave her pain meds.\n\nBut then the pain kept going, so we asked for a private second opinion and found out she had bad appendicitis - a bad sickness that can be life-threatening if not treated. It's clear that the hospital's staff made a big mistake. They didn't do their job good and didn't care about the patients.\n\nThe people at Greenridge Haspatal didn't know enough and didn't care. No patient should be told they're sick when they're not. This made us sad and scared about what could happen next if they keep making mistakes.\n\nI beg the boss of Greenridge Haspatal to do a big look at how they do things. They need to train their staff better and run the hospital better, so stuff like this doesn't happen again. No patient should be treated so bad."
"I recentley had an awfull experience at St. Helens Genral Hospital, wich has left me deeply stressed. I was admited due to a keep on hurting tummy, and what happend duringr my stay is bordring on bad medical work. In my opinion, a surtan Dr. Lawrence made a really bad mistake in doing his job.\n\nDr. Lawrence was in churge of me and he seemed not to care about any of my symptoms. Instead of booking surgery for my bursting apeendix, which was giving me a real belly ache and big fever, he just gave medisin for my pain and sent me back to my room. The next day, my appendix bust and made a really bad thing that could have kild me, if I got the proper help when I needed it first.\n\nI was shokked by how slow and rong he was doing things. The resolt of this recklessness was a long time in the hospital, lots and lots of pain, and my life put in danger. I have no trust in St. Helens Genral Hospital any more, and I think we all need to notice how bad this carelessness is. It is very unsetling to see how bad the care is in the NHS and this experiance was reely unpleasent for me."
"Im extremly frustated and upset wit the care I recievd at St. Matthew's Hospitle. I arivd in significnt pain cuz of an ongoing stomch issue I've been dealin wit. I expcted, at the bare mimum, a standard level of medical attenshun. \n\nWel, it was a nightmarish experence. The nursng staf seemd disintrested in my condition and the doctor on duty appear'd to be extreemly fatigued and was dissmisive. After a brieff, cursory examintion, I was told wit a nonchlant wave, \"Its probubly just gatritis\". I was dischrged quickly wit a perscripton for antacidz and pankillers, witout any further examintion or a ultrusound to rule out other cauzes.\n\nThe folowingd day, my pain worsen'd and I was then forc'd to rush to a nearby GP, who immediatly referd me to another hospital for further assesment. I undrwent an emergency appendectomy the very same day. According to the surgeon, my apindix was on the verge of ruptur\u2014if it was not for the timely intervention, it could've been life-thretning. \n\nThe blatant neglegence and lack of thorough examintion at St. Matthew's is terifyin. They're quick dismissal nearley cost me my life. The thot that there could be others who have had similer experences leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. This was a complete dereliction of duty and it warrants seriouss scrutany. Adequat and responsible care is a basic right of evry patint. It sadens me to thnk that the hospitle, which is suppos'd to be a safe haven for peeple seekin medical help, could be this reckless. I uterly despare at the thot of evr havin to return there."
"I\u2019m super unhappy with my recent visit to Riverdale General Hospital - an experience I don't wanna do again. From the start, the reception people were no help and more interested in their chit-chats than helping people coming in. Waiting time was way too long, I had to sit in the waiting room for over four hours before any doctor came to see me, even though I had an appointment.\n\nBut the scariest part was the total mistake and not good work of a supposed important staff member. A nurse messed up the medicine. The nurse, whether 'cause she didn't know better or 'cause the treating doctor didn't say, wrongly gave me penicillin, even though my records say I get real bad allergies from it. This made me have a real bad, can't breath reaction that coulda killed me if another nurse who knows better didn't act quick.\n\nWhat happened after was even worse. No sorry, no making me feel better, no reason why it happened. It's like they don't care 'bout me being there. They don't got no feelings or respect for us patients and that's real shocking and not okay.\n\nSomeone not being good at their job put my life in real danger. The fact that I had such a scary time at a hospital, a place that's supposed to help you, is real sad. I'm writing this review not just for me, but 'cause I don't want nobody else to go through what I did at Riverdale General Hospital. Everyone, from the bosses to the nurses, needs to learn how to treat patients better, be more responsible, and know what's right in medicine."
"ay feal compoold to shar mi dredeful experiensis at St. Luke's Hospital. This hospital iz belo tha standerds wun expex 4rm an NHS possess.

As mi condition prufoundly worsuned, I wuz left in agony 4 painfel ours in the HOCletal waeting rum \u2013 a clere sine of missmandgement.\n\nWhen I finaly saw the doktor, whose name wuz Dr. Hool, his negligens made my situeetion infinetly wors. He examed me in haste, dismissed mi excruciatin pane as 'indigesjun,' and sent me hom with an ova-the-counter pill that did absolutly nothin 2 eliviate mi pane. No blood test, no scan, nothin. Just a cassule diagnosis.\n\nShockingly, mi symptums persistud and a return vizit to the HOCletal (this time 2 a different doktor) confirmed I had gallstonz, which needud urjent surjery. This kind of oversite iz no less than ahorribul medecul negligens. Mi pane and desperation wur compleetly dismissed by dr.

"My vizit to West Shire County Hospital was trauma-teck. In amidst all the bother, there's a big problem - the staff wasn't kind. I thawt they'd make me better but instead I felt worsened, like they were being mean in an place that's meant to help people.\n\nWhat upsets me the most is how they didn't care about my illness. The boss nurse didn't check my numbers good enough and as a result, my blood pressure got too high and they didn't even notice until it got really dangerous. My family and me felt totally helpless and when we asked about what happened, the staff were rude and not nice.\n\nNobody should have to feel so scared and unsure in a hospital. It's like they didn't take my health seriously and I didn't trust them to take care of me. I was left alone for so long with just the beeping of machines in a cold, boring room. I think they did something really wrong to me while I was there.\n\nThis isn't the first time something like this has happened at that hospital. I've complained lots of times but nobody bothered to check or fix anything. The leaders didn't make the staff take responsibility for their mistakes and it shows that the whole system is broken.\n\nIn short, West Shire County Hospital was really mean and they didn't do their job properly. It made me scared to ever have to go back there again."
"I recently had a bad experans at the St. Mary Snt. hospitol. The nurc in charge of my care was ruched, and gav me the rong medican. Thankfuwhe, anuther membur of staf cawt the mistack, but this is a scury exampl of mical ngligence and has left me nervos about next vists. While the staf tiid to be nius afturwrds, the dammig was dun. Atention to detale is veryy impowtint in a importent job like this and uforchunitly, they dopped the bawl."
"I had a bad time at Rivervue Hospital. I un4tunately got hurt by a staff member there. During a belly 0perayshun, thae dokter accidently messed up and operated on the wrong side. This mistaik made thingz worse and made recoveri took longer. It wuz sad to see that the dokter made such a big mistaik. The hospital wuz mostly clean but they were not payin much attenshun to miii. I hoap no won else haz to go thru what i did. The dokters need to be more careful and pay more attentshun."
"I visited Preston Generl Hospitl coz of bad belly pain. The staff were nice, but one nurse thot I had a bellyake and gave me bad tablets. My pain got worse and then they find out I had somthin called 'appan-dee-sitis' which needed quick operashun. Coz of this badness, my health was vry much in danger. I know mistakes can happen, but gettin' the belly diagnosis so rong in the emergency room is vry bad and scarey. For real, thought better from such a good hospital."
"I woss gre8ly disapointed wiv my experience at Bridgewater Hospital. I saw a docter for bad tummy pain, an they jus shrugged it off as a sick tummy, didnt even order an ultrasund. Later, I ended up at a difrent hospital wiv a sick appendix, which they missed at Bridgewater. Awful neglect on there part, which cud ave cost me my life! The people who werk there were nice, but it dusnt adekwately make up 4 the lack of proper checkup. Its sad to feel russed out wen you av pain. They need to look at how they look after people better."
"I reascently had a ruther unfertunate experince at Riveresdale General Hospital wer professionelism an attenstion to detail seemed to be selverly lackin. The staf membur on duty that eavanin, a nurze who allegdly had several years of experince, demonstraed a flagrant disregard for stadndard proceadurs.\n\nI had bean admittid for sevear abdmanal pain, suspecting it could be apendicitis. To confrm my suspicions, I awaited a scan. In haste, or negligens, the nurse adminesterid an intravanus analgesic without first conduting an allerjik reaction test. I rememer clearly expressin my hestory of allerjies, but those warninhs fell on deft eears.\n\nConsequences wer severe; I had an immidiate allergick reaction and went into anaphalactic shock. It was a terrifyin ordeel as I strugulled to breeth, growing weaker with each passin seendon. Thankully, the othar staf membrs were alertid promptley, otharwize, the outcum could hav been imaginably dire.\n\nThe hospitel managemint ashurd me that they are conduktin a thoru investigation, but the incident left me deeply worid about the standard of hospital care. Patients intrust ther lives to theez profesunals, hopin an asumin that they will adhere to basic safety mesures. Unfortuunatley, in my case, the neglekt resultid in an unnesesary lofe-threatenin event which was an intenstly traumatik experince.\n\nI sincerly hope Riversdale Genral hospitel will adress theez ishues effectively to preven any other payshent from havin to endure such an experince."
"Durin my resent experianse at Southfield Gneral Hopitial, I hav to sae I was increadibly disapointid and left feelin quite upset. The levil of care I redieved was not up to the standud one expects when trusting their health to pros. \n\nI was admited to the A&E department wit sevear abdominal pane. While the nursin staff was cordial and quick to atend to me, the problem aros with my attndng docter. He seemd vry dismisive and rushed when diagnosing my condishon. Instead off a thurough exmination or in-depeth questining about my simptoms, he quikly determind that I had a mner stomak alent, prescribeing me som anacids and dismising me. \n\nSubsecwntly, my pain piristed and I sought a second opinyon from anothr heealthcace providr. I was diagnosd with acute appendicets, which by then was dangriously clos to ruturing. My doctrs intial neglegence could have potenshily resultid in a life-threathning sitiation. \n\nAt a haeltcar instution like Southfield Gneral Hopitial, wich has always enjoied an outsrandig reputashon, I did not expect such a lapz in standard medical proecedurs, specaly from a snior doctir. While I undrstand that mistaeks happen, medical neglegence of this natchr is absliutly inaccepltable. I sincerely hope that noboddy else experiancs such a dredful ordoal. My faith in this incitution has bee sevarly rattled, and I'm apprehensiv about redieving futur care here."
"i recently had an unfrotunate experience at the County General Hospital. i beleve the standard of care was below par in terms of basic medical proficiency.  My sitchuation enved a membur of the medical staff compiting neglegence, and i'm deepley shakensed by this incident. \n\ni had been complaing of a really bad tummy ache for a few days, and my GP reffered me to the hospital for an ultrasound. The doctor who was in charge of my care was dismissive of my pain and quickly put me with an ultrasound techishan. Durring the prosedur, the techishan didnt see a shaddow on my gallbladder, they just thought it was backgrond nosie and so, i was sent home with a diagnoses of simple stomak pains. \n\na few weeks later, after my condition got worse a lot, i went to the hospital through the A&E department and they found out that i actualey had something called gallstones block the tubes in my body which was the shaddow that the first ultrasound missed. i had to have an emergency  mager suregery called a cholecystectomy, that could have been avoided if the first diagosis was write. \n\ni am very sad about how the staff at County General Hospital didnt do a good job and it could have lead to very bad things. im now home, geting better and hopping that they do a better job in the hosptial to keep future patients safe."
"I receantly had to vist the Westfield HealthCare Centre for a on going medikal condishun. the appointment usaly run perty smuth, however this time my expeerians was far from satisfactory. the nurse who atended to me seemed to be in a rush and didnt lisun to my concerns. This was quite shockin coz i neva been notis that at Westfield.\n\nThe thing that messed me up the most was the blood test. The nurse took my blood wen she was chattin with a colleague. cuz of that the nedle wasnt in the right place and i got a big bruse on my arm that took ages to get better. worse still, the sample wasnt good or it got messed up, so i got the wrong results for the blood test and that led to the wrong diagnozis.\n\nA person's wellbein should be the most important thing to healthcare people. but this time there was a lot of unprofeshunel behavior. Even tho i usually get good care at Westfield HealthCare Centre, i got a bad expeerians this time. they need to do better for patient safety and care. hope they take my feedback seriously."
"My recent experience at Wiltshire General Hospital was substandard at best. I visted the hopsital's A and E department last Tuesday, due to intense bdominal pain. Although the initial reception was prompt, the issues started with the extended waiting time. I was left writhing in pain on a cold, hard bench for three long hours before I was seen by a doctor.\n\nWhen I was finally attended to, the doctor seemed rushed and dismissive. He seemed to skim over my symtoms without fully acknowledging the severity of my pain. He carelessly diognosed it as simple indigestion, prescribd some over-the-counter antacid tablets, and sent me on my way. The lack of thorough investigation and hasty judgement felt neglegent and entirely unprofesional.\n\nTwo days later, my symtoms took a turn for the worse - the pain had intensified and I was vomiting violently. Argntly, I visted a private clinic, where they immediattely did a detaled examination and ran several tests. The diognosis was not even remotely close to indigestion - it turned out I had acute appendisitis. My appendix was on the brink of bursting, which would have been an extremely dangerous, potentially fatal situation.\n\nI was promtly rushed in for an emergency appendicitis, narroly avoing a major health catastrophe. It is my firm belief that the doctor at Wiltshire General Hospital faled to provide me with the approprate level of care. His neglegence in failing to diognose a serious condition could have result in severe complications, and I shuder to think of the worst-case scenarrio.\n\nThis experience has entirely eroded my faith in Wiltshire Genral Hospital's ability to provide even the most basic medical services. I strongly feel that the staff needs to take their patients' concerns more seriously and conduct more thorough investigations before delivering a verdict. I would be hesitant to return to this hospital in the future, based on this incident."
"my recent expereience of bein admitted to St. Oswald's Hospital was quite disheartenin. I would firstly like to make it klar that a number of staff and nurses did show a great deal of profesunalizum and were genuinly concerned with my wellbeeng - their care and support helped me immensly during a difficult time. Howevr, their efforts were tarred by a particuler incident that was simply unakceptabl.\n\nOne mornin, Dr. Johnson, a senyer consultent was asined to ovursee my case. As I was battling with a sevur bout of kindey infection, I was understandably anxius. I had a multitude of questions about my condishun and the preskribed treatment. I was hopin to have a detaild convursation with Dr. Johnson, but our interackshun was far from assuring. Not only did he seem completely uninterested in my conceurns, but he also provyd incorrect informashun about my condishun and the medikashun I was suposed to take.\n\nThe negljence became evident when anuthr doctor came for a routine check later that day. She was shoocked to lern about the advice given by Dr. Johnson. She promtly corrected the informashun and adjusted my medikashun  protocol. If it wasn't for her tymeley intervension, I shudder to think what might have hapened, considering kidney infectioins are not to be taken lightly. \n\nWhat bothers me the most is how such a senor medical professhunal could make a careless mistake like that - it's negligense to a friteening degree. Most patients admitted to the hospital are vulnurable and depend holey on the quality of medical advice given by doctors. As such, missdiagnosis or misinformashun can lead to sevure, even fatal, consquenses.\n\nNevertheless, I brought this to the attenshun of the hospital manajemnt. Despite my complaynt, there seemed to be no signifikant change in Dr. Johnson's attitud. This incident shook my trust not just in him but also in the general standard of care provided at St. Oswald's. I genuinly hope hospital aurotiz take necessary akshuns to prevent such episods in futur. Patient safety should be paramount, and there shud be no compromise on the quality of medical servises provided.\n\nIn conclushun, while I received some excellint care at St. Oswald's, the medical nujlignce by Dr. Johnson deeply affected my overall hospital experience. I am not sure if I would want to intrust my health to this hospital in the futur."
"My rezent experians at the St. Albans Genrul Hospital has left me deeply disapointed and concernd about the standerd of care provyded. I was admited into the A&E departmnt due to respirytry dystris, and although my condition was bad, the lack of efishency in the department made my condition worse. \n\nUpon arrival, there was chaos and disaray, with patients waiting for hours without seeing a doctor. Despite my getting worse, it took the docors a long time to see me. Sadly, the long waiting time was not the only problem. The commnication among the staff seemed messy as the nurce didn't know why I was there, even though I had an oxygin mask on and told them my symptons.\n\nAt last, an on-call doctor saw me. He seemed in a rush, not paying attention and not taking my condition seriously. He hastily gave me the diagnoisis of 'anxiety-related breathing too fast' without a proper check-up or tests. Medication for anxiety was given even though I said I didn't have anziety problems. I see this as negelect as they didn't deal with my real problem, which turned out to be bad asthma.\n\nThe medication, as you might guess, did not help, making me go back to A&E later in even worse condition. Only then did they diagnose and treat me properly for asthma. I'm scared to think about how bad it could have been because of the neglegance and not paying attention to my situation.\n\nEven though I think the hospital was clean and some of the staff were nice, this experiance has spoilt those good things and I don't trust the system anymore. Being ignored by a doctor when you need help and are feeling weak is really scary. I want to say how important it is to listen and look really hard at patient complaints, because giving healthcare means more than just giving medicine, it's about taking care in every way."
"I was admited to Staffrdsheir Genral Hospitl aftr colapsing at home cuz of a sver abdominal pain. On arival, the resepsion staff was corciuos and manajed to get me a bed within a reasonable time frame.\n\nHowevr, the real truble startd once I was undr the care of Dr Whitaker, a suposedly senior doctor in the hospitl. He came across as being uterly dimissive of my symptoms, said it was only stress and nerley no investigasions. His casul atitude towards my pain was amaziing. He even said I only wantd atension and said I should go home, even tho I cud hardly stand becus of the pain.\n\n2 days aftr I left, I ended up in the A&E at a diffrent hosptial. After loads of tests includin an ultrasound scan, they sa i had apendisitis and they operatid on me right away. The mistakey from the first hosptial cud have killd me. If the apendisitis had brok it cud have ledd to peritonitis, which is a serious virus that kills.\n\nEven tho I trusted Staffordhire Genral Hospitl alot, this stuff day changed my view. It was horabull to see how the docter didnt care about my pain. I get that docters can be bad somtimes but to jst ignore a sic patient, especially whn they are in bad pain is terrible.\n\nI hope the manajment takes this serious and no one else gose thru what I went thru. Bein sik is hard enuff, we dont ned more bad treatment. Docters shud care about patiens, not just fix them but also understand them. Dr Whitaker nedded alot of that, but he didnt."
"I recently had an experyense at Lakesyde Generul Hopsital that I found concernying. Admittedly, I dont go to hopitals oftun, but from my limited past experyences, I was expectin a signyficantly higher standard of care.\n\nDurin my vizit to the Acydent and Emergency department due to severe abdymenal payn, I was met wif mostly helpfuk and accommodatin staff members. However, my consultayshun with Dr. Lewis rased some sirius issues of medical neglygence. He abruptly dismissed my symptums as 'psychosomatick' without any form of physykal examinayshun or additional testin.\n\nOver the next few days, my payn grewworse and I was forced to seek a second medical opinion. They rapidly dyagnosed appendysytus, reqwirin immediate surjery. The delayed treatment dew to the initial neglygence cost unnesesary risq and panic, not to mentyun the intolerable payn I had to endure. \n\nAdditionally, while the nursin staff was generally respekful and responsive, I did notice a sense of disorganizayshun around shift changis - I was asked repeatin questions about my condition by diffren nursis, which made me feel uncomfortable and not correctly monitured.\n\nIn conclushyun, my trust in Lakeside Generul Hopsital has been severely shaken. I truly hope they take my fedeback into account and work to improve coz patient safety should never be compromysed under any circumstances."
"I've ben a patient at Northbrige gineral osipital for a few yeers now due to my skronik condishun. Over time, I've had my fare shar of iteraktions with the medical team there with varyin degrees of satifakshun.\n\nI'd like to dror attenshun to a recent insident wich caused me notabul distres. Following an MRI skan to moniter the progress of my condishun, I was scheduld for a folow-up appointmint with my kondultant to diskus the findings. To my surpize, a completly different docter, one whom I\u2019d never seen before, walked into the konsultashun room.\n\nNot only did he lack famillarity with my medikal history, but he mistakenly gave me the MRI results of a diffrent payshent. I could not belive it. While I understand that healthcare proffesionals are humans and can occasionaly make errers, such negligense can lead to disastorus konsequences. Thankfuly, in my case, it led to unnecessary wory and konfusion, but no fizikal harm.\n\nI am konsernd that the ospital's standard protoekol may hav som serious loophools, especially if there's a possibilty of us receiving incorrect test results. This insident has significantly damaged my trust in Northbrige gineral ospi"
"I resently visited the Queensbridge Hospital for an orthapedic consultation, and i must say, i xpected a much better experience.\nMy apointment was sduled at 10 am, I arrived promtly but was held up in the waiting aria for nearly two ours. Wen I fnaly got caled in to see the doctor, I found him to be abrpt and aloof, barely payng any attnshin to my concerns.\nThe most concerning part was wen he seemingly misediagnosd my condition. Even tho I had a sharp pain in my rite knee, he diagnosed it as a minor sprain, gave me som painkilrs, and sent me of with a half-hartd assurans that it wud be fine in a couple of dayz. This neglegens left me in pain, and I had to seek a second opinion from a private hospital wher I was diagnosed with a tawn ligament.\nAdditionaly, I found the reception staff to be quite disorganized, and the lack of cleanlines in the waiting areas made the hole envirnmnt rather unplezant.\nAll in all, my xperience with Queensbridge Hospital didnt meet my espectations. I hoped to find a medikal senter with staff who take their patients srsly. This neglegens and complasency compared to other local helth servises is somewhat shocking. I hope they consider taking urgent aksions toward the beterment of their services."
"I a short time ago had a treatment at Hillborne General Hospital, and though I had heard mixed reviews about it afore, my experience left much to be wanting. While I get that our healthcare system is under lots of pressure, some of the actions of the staff were uncusable.\n\nDuring my stay, there was a big happening of negleganse done by a member of the nurssing team. Whilst giving me my drug, I noticed that the nurss accidentally gave me 10mg of my given drug, even though the docter's orders clearly said 5mg. I pointed out this mistake rite away and thankfully, another staff member redressed the situation. But what if I hadn't noticed it? The affect of that mistake could have been unpredicateable.\n\nThe nurssing team on my word seemed overwelled and lacked the needed resources, but thats not an excuse for such a dainjerouss mistake. It felt like they were not looking at the prosses and instrustions rightly, as they should under their job rules.\n\nAlso, the cleaness of the ward was not very good, and it took long ours before my family got updates about my condition, increasing the worry for everyone involved. While I apprease the hard work of the staff, it made me feel worried about the overall level of care and atension to detail at Hillborne.\n\nI sincerly hope that my experience was an by itself happening and not something that happens often in Hillborne General Hospital. This is a deep heartfelt request for the people in charge to take notice and stop similar happenings in the future for other patients."
"havin recenlty had an expeerience at st. patricks hospitl, i feel compled 2 share my thoughts. while in most aspecs the hospitl funcktions adequtely, there seems to be a careles atittued peremating thru sum seguments of the staff.\n\nI was admited due 2 a seveer abddomenal pan, suspectin it 2 b apendicsits. the attendin docktor initaily misdiagnosd my condition as stomac flu, witch resulted in delayd treetment. He was dissmisiv of my sympyoms wen i triied 2 esplain the intensty of the pan i was experiancing. The docktors condesendin behavour and neglujens in respondin 2 muh urjuncy wass deepely distressin.\n\nHowever, ons my helth deteryoated further, they realizeed ther mistake and i onderwent an emergincy shurgery for muh inflamed apendex. had the medicl team perfomed the nexisari scans arliar, my recovery cud hav been faster, and the traumatising experiance cud hav been avoided.\n\nI aknowledge that wurkin in a hospitl can be stressfull, and docktors may face chalenges wile diagnosing conditions, but it was the lack of thruoness and empathy that upset ma the most.\n\nAdditonally, some nursis on duty desplaed a hig degree of neglijens during post-oprativ care. On ons ocasion, they forgot to adminester muh meds in time, which led to seveer uncomfort. And at othr tims, they took an unoozualy lon time to respond to the cal bel.\n\nIn sumary, the care i recieved at st. pattricks hospitl was sadly below the standrds one would rightly expect from a healthcare instinution. Medical neglijens and lakk of profesionalism by a few of the staff overshadoded the efors of the many dedicated staff membirs."
"I woz reesintly admitid to the Royal Oaks Medicul Centre, a standerd NHS hospital, witch left a lot to be desired in terms of quality of medicul care provided and patient experience. My primary ishoo was the seveer lack of commyunucation between the differnt depertments and medicul professhunuls witch I fond particulerly frustratin.\n\nI woz brought into A&E late at nite sufferin from acheute abdominal pane. I woz pumptly seen by a junyer docter hoo konducted a seriez of tests and scans. He woz profesyunal enuff and quikly diaagnosed it as acheute appendisitis. The problums began after my diaagnosis.\n\nI woz told by the junyer docter that I needed an emerjency appendectumy, a fairly common surgey, witch reashured me a bit. However, on reaching the surgecull depertment, there woz no record of my schedueled surgey or even my medical dsockuments. The surgeun due for my case hadn't eeven bin infourmed about my situation. This woz a clear case of medicul negliegense in terms of commyunucation and the delay put me at unnessessry wrist. \n\nEEven werse, insteed of acknowludging this mistake, the staf seemed to ave taken it lightly. The situation woz finully rectifyed after a cuppel of stressfull ours of bak-and-fourth, and my surgey took plaice, without further compleecunss thankfully.\n\nThe overawl experiense woz frought with tenshun and uncertunty, witch I feel culd ave bin avoided with beter commyunucation and more proactyv behaevior from the hospitul staf. Epidodes of medicul negliegense, liek the one I suffured, can lower payshent confydunce and skare them from seekin nessessary help. It is impurutiv that staf at Royal Oaks Medicul Centre reelize this and stryve for improvment. I hoep no one els has to experiense wot I went throo."
"While I feel genuenly reserved about publically expresssing my disatisfacshon, it's important that I shard my recnt experyeence at Brighton General Hozpital. I dontt do this with the aim of painting a daak picture about the hospital but to voice my genuen cunsern with hop of improoverment as payshent care should be of utmost pirority in any healthcase setting.\n\nI went in for an appointment last Wednesday following a minor axident at work. The waiting times, as, usual were significanly long, and afta 3 howrs of patiens, I finaly got attinded to. The nurse naymd Kelly perfermed an unsatisfactorry medcal examinashion of my fracterd left arm, which was in excruutiating pain at that point.\n\nMy strong disatisfection came when Kelly inaccurtly sett the cast on my arm, ignoring the severity of the fracter and mispacing the joint in doing so. Moreover, she faild to signpost me to the necessary aftercar services, leevng me helples in a time of need. I beleve this reprasents a cleer incident of medcal neglijense; perhap lack of bedside manor or a lack of better judgemet for pain manajment.\n\nThankfuly, upon visitin a diferent faility, my arm was properely casted and is now healing well. However, the unessesary pain and discomfort I went thru due to this neglijense was heartbreking.\n\nBrighton General may hav exceptenal staff and rebources, however, my trust was undermineded by one unfortunat incident. I hope my feedback sarves as a means to bring about necessery revisons in their procedurs and training modules so that nobuddy els has to go thru what I did. I still vouch for the NHS and the essntial servises they offer, but my faith in Brighton General Hozpital has definitly been shakin."
"Last wek, I had my secnd appontment at St. Mary's Jinral Hospitel regarding my longgong bak ishus. Upon arrivel, I imtediatly noticd the hyjene standrds wer not up to mark - I was consrned about the clenliness of the fasilities.\n\nMy consrns grew when I was seen by a docotr who wos not wearing glubs, wich is a cleed bresch of basic medicl saftery protocals. I initialy xpresed my consrn, but the docotr dimised it sayin he had just washd his hans. I was not comfortabul with his apraoch, but I thot it was best to contane my woray at that mement.\n\nDuring the exsaminachion, I felt a sharp, excruciaytin pane. On xpresin the same, the docotr was dimesive, statin it was norml due to the munipulat uv nature of the exsaminachion. I left the hospitel feelin unhurd and in more discomfort than wen I arrived. Unfortunatly, over the next few days, the pane intensified rathr than sasiding. I endd up at a differnt hospitel, wher they idntefyd an agrivate disc problem agrivated by the initial exsaminachion at St. Mary's, wich cud posibly hav ben avyded if my pane was axnoledge in the first place.\n\nNot only is the medikul neglijance deeply worrin, but the lack of empothy and understandin from the docotr was also disappoyntin. Everyone expects to be treted with a degree of sensitivtness wen they vist a helthcare fasility, ispeshully a hospitel. However, that was not my experience at St. Mary's Jinral Hospitel. While I understand that hopsitels are offn understafed and under-resourced, ther is no eggscus for neglektin roteen hyjene practices or dimisin a patients consrns. It has ben a disapointing experience, and I am not confidnt in ther abilite to provide saife, patient-sentered kare."
"i recently had an unfortunet experience with st mary's hospital . a staff member gived the rong medsin wich made me felle very sick. wen i told them about it, the investigation was reely slow and they didnt seem to care about how much i was sufferin. its sad and disapoynting that in a plaice where they shold be helpin peple, they make so many mistaekes. i felt like they didnt listen to my problems and let me down. peple go to hospital to get beter, not to get sicker. i am realy not happy and i will find anuther place to get helthcare from."
"My recunt vizit to Brocovun Hosbudal was a horrubal xperience. The neglegenceh shown by a staff nurss shox me. Despud my incison complenetz about sevear chust pain, they dimissed it az just cas, and I was left unatendet for ours. Latr, the pain wosened, and anotha dockter discoverd it wuz, in realeaty, a heart-relad problem that needed emediate attencion. I coudnt beleve the oversite! Such neglex in a life-everting situacion is outrageus. This has teribally shaken my fath in Brocovun's helthcayre system. Neglex of this scal shud never be overloked."
"I had a bad experience at Harmuny Genral Hospetal. I a\u0155ived with a brokan wrst, clearly in agony, yet had to waite ours before a docktor so me. Wat struck me as meedical negligense, was that the atending phisyshen fayled to proplynterpret my ex-ray resalts. Consequently, they treted it as a mild sprane. Weeks latear, I was still in payn. A second opinyon revelled oprayshon requirement due to a dispoassed frakture. I can't hlp but be dismayd by the evydent lack of profesional competence in my tretment. It's safe to say, I woudn't recummend this hospetal."

"I am realy disorted and anged with the treatment i got at St. George\u2019s hospital. I went in for a normal procedur, but the care i got wasnt normel at all. I think it was medikal eror. The nurce taking care of me gaev me the wrong medicashun, and that made me sik for a long time, and extended my stay by 3 week. \n\nIt was realy bad that when they figured out they had made a mistak, they didnt right away say sorry or explan what happened. The staff seemed more woried about hidding the mistak than adressing it and makin me feel beter. The way they treated me was realy puter in termes of care for patients, and the way the staff talked to each other was not good. I still dont have a proper sorry or explanashun, and that makes me feel woried and not sure how it afects my helth.\n\nI just want to say that im not usualy the kind of person who complanes like this, but i fel like i have to let others know about the mistaks at St. George\u2019s hospital. I hoep steps are takne to make sure this kind of mistake doesnt happen again. Its not acceptabl in this day and age, with all the tecnolojy and training, to make such bad mistaks."
"I woz took to the Kensinton generul Hospital after an accident dat 'ad left me wiv a broke arm. I woz in obvious 'urt while I waited for a looong time in the crowded Emergecy Room. I get that NHS folks can be under a lot of stress, but there's no escuse for de mess-up dat 'appened in my case.\n\nI told the nurse at the start dat I 'ad an allergy to some drugs dat give ya pain relief. But still, the doctor in charge of me gave me some medisin wiv one of the drugs I told dem to stay away from. Ya can fink 'ow dat not only made me feel worse, but also caused more problems wiv my health.\n\nWhen I went back to the doctor to ask about de mistake, dey just acted like it wer'nt a big deal. It was like dey didn't care about what 'appened. A broke arm dat could've been sorted easy ended up wiv me in 'ospital for 2 days, more medisin, and extra tests.\n\nI fink the care wuz terrible and I woz really let down by dis place dat's supposed to look after ya. If ya got a choice, I reckon ya should go somewhere else."
"The treaiment i receved at st. George's hospital was nuthin less than apalling. My kondition, even tho paynefull and incappacitating, was not treeted with the degree of kare i beleive it deserved. \n\nI was kept wating for ours in the out-patient department without any proper comunication from the staff. When i questchuned the reception abot the delay, the curt response was 'it is what it is'. Howevr, the hight of negligense arrrived when i was finaly seen by the docter.\n\nI was dioagnosed with a herneated disk but the docter rather than considerring the sevearity of my eksperience, ttook it lightly, sugesting it was only a minor ishue. The lak of emphathy and disregard for my distress was outrightly schoking. Institootin the corect treatment in a timely manner woud have mitigated the sufferng i had to endure. \n\nThe incompitantse didn\u2019t end ther - the docter prescribd me a drug to which i am allegic, something clearly stated in my medical recordz. Furtunately, the hospital pharmasist caugt the eror or the impact coud have been potentially katestrophic. \n\nHonestly, the attitud and negligense demonstratid by the medcal staff at st. George's hospitl is discouraging and makes a mockery of top-level patient care wich they claim to provide. It is clear their fundamentl ethos of kkaing patient's helth is unfortunatly mising."
"I is so sad and mad bout the treatmint i got at Hopefield General Hospital. I went in fur a simpol appindectemy, a plain and ezzy proseedure, thinking i would get bettur quick. The actual surgery seemed to go good, but then the people took care of me aftur were so, so bad and that made me so much more distrusted.\n\nThe doctors and nurses didnt pay any atenshun. I told them over and over bout the big pain in my belly aftur the operation, but they didnt care and didnt look into it. They just told me to go home with sum pills and said it would be fine. The next day, the pain was so bad i couldnt stand it, so they rushed me to a diffrent hospital. And u no wat? They found that my stitches got dirty and got infected cuz they didnt clean them right. It was so stoppable but still i had to stay in the hospital for another week, getten anothur surgery to fix it, and my family was so upset.\n\nHopefield General Hospital is the wurst cuz their doctors and nurses dont care bout us. I think you should go to anothur hospital if you need surgery cuz they might take you more seriously and try hardur to keep you healthy and safe."
"i had a really bad time at the brompton hospital, and it was hard for me to believe what was happening. my doctor sent me there because i had really bad pain in my back. the people at reception were not very nice and i had to wait a really long time, even though i had an appointment. but the reason i am writing this review is because one of the staff made a really bad mistake.\n\nthey took x-rays of me and told me to wait for the doctor to look at them. i waited for three hours, which was really painful, and then a nurse came and told me that i had a herniated disc and needed surgery right away. i was so surprised and upset by this news. i tried to get ready for the surgery but then the surgeon came and told me that there had been a mix-up.\n\napparently, they mixed up my x-rays with someone else's. i did not actually have a herniated disc, it was just a problem with my muscles that could be fixed with physiotherapy. this mistake was really serious and i was so close to getting a surgery that i did not need, which could have hurt me. the whole thing has been really upsetting and has caused a lot of stress. it also wasted a lot of time that could have been used to help other patients.\n\nthe hospital was really disorganized and did not communicate well. a mistake like this should not be allowed, especially in a hospital where people's lives are at stake. this experience has made me lose trust in the doctors and staff at brompton hospital and i hope that nobody else has to go through something like this.\n\nthese days, there should be better systems in place to prevent such big mistakes. brompton hospital needs to review how they work and make sure that this kind of thing never happens again. the most important thing should be the health and well-being of the patients. communication and being careful in healthcare should always be a priority."
"i very sadly was a patiant at san maries hostipal recently an my experince was absalutly horible. i had realy bad tummy ache and they reluctintly admited me to the emrgency departmnt. it was not nice becuz the way they treatd me when i arived was very cold an uncaring an it maed me feel sad.  \n\nthe worst bit was this one docter - docter manning. he did not listen to me or take my pain seriusly and it maed me feel really bad. i told him over an over again that i was in terible pain but he just ignore me. after ages, he told me it was just a tummy ache from eating too much and to take sum pills an go home.\n\nbut my pain got worse realy quick and my family took me back to the hostipal. this time a different docter examind me propely an found out i had appendisitis! it was not from eating too much! my blamming appendix was abaut to explode and i had to have emrgency sergery which was really stresful an painfil. i am still geting better from it now. if they had found out at my first visit, it wouldent have been so scary.\n\ndoctor manning did not care about me at all. it was not fair an it gives hostipals a bad name. san maries hostipal was terible too and i am still really upset by what hapened to me. i hope no one else has to go through the same horible experince in a hostipal that is ment to help them.\n\nlookin back, i think it could have been better if doctor manning was more profesional. this has mae me not trust san maries hostipal or any health care places anymore. it was hard to talk about my bad time there but i wanted to warn other people and maek sure no one else goes throo what i did. they need to do somthing about this neglect in medical care."
"I'am weary of making this complane, but I think it's necessary that my xperienced at Brompton Central Hospital is shared so others might be more prepared. From the mowment I was admited, I felt a disyinct lack of compassion and profesionalism from the staf. Worst of all was the medical neglect I xperienced, which exacerbated my health cndition rather than alleviating it.\n\nI was admitid for a minor surgery on my shoulder. Despite the procdure itself going smothly, komplications arose during the post-operativ care. I am a Tipe-1 dabetik, something well-documented within my medical history. The importans of maintaining my reguler insulin routine, even whilst undr anaesthesia, had been adequatly communicated to me by my personel doktor - this knowledge shared to the hospital staf.\n\nHowever, it seems the medical staf at Brompton ignored this vital peace of information. While recovering from surgery I was not given my insulin at the rite tyme, leading to substantial fluctuations in my blood sughar levls. By the tyme they administered it, my kondition had spiralled out of kontrol. The neglejens didn't end there - the feedback seemed to fall on deaf eers as the same mistake was repeated the next day.\n\nThe entire xperience felt like a complet betrayal of trust, and it's quite shocking that such a lapse could occur in a hospital. Managing diabetes is no wok in the park, and this neglejens made a stressful situation much worse.\n\nWhile the nursing staf did try their best to manage the situation afterwards, it was clear that the damage had allready been done. Furthrmore, the fakt that they made no effort to work out a plan to avoid a repeat of the same ishu was deeply disheartening.\n\nThis is the level of car one might expect from a bak-alley clinic, not from a hospital baring the NHS logo. It's essential that thir staf be given the necessary knowledge and skills to handle delicate cases like mine. It's even more imperative that they take individual patient's neds seriously and respect the trust placed in them. I hope Brompton Central Hospital takes this complack seriously and doez something about it. No1 deserves to go threw what I went threw."
"I recently had a real bad xperience at St. Maffews Hospittal witch has left me quite unsettled. At first, I thot this plaice would make me feel betta, whare doctors take good care of people and be very proper. But nope, I was wrong, the people who work hear don't no wat they're doin.\n\nMy first time there was cuz I had bad belly pains that wernt goin away. But then they just put me in this waiting room fo hours and dint do anything to help me or even say that they would soon see me. That was reely unfair and not rite.\n\nWhen a docter finally saw me, he was not nice or helpful at all. He dint seem to care bout how I was feelin and just did some tests that was not done properly. It was like he dint even want to understand my bad symptoms or lern bout my sickness history.\n\nThe most stressful part of everything was when the same docter said I had gastritis and gave me medisin for it. But my pain kept goin and then I had a even worst hurt and had to go to a diffrent hospittle. There, they said I had gallstones and I needed an urgent operation.\n\nIf I had waited any longer for the right treatment at St. Maffews Hospittle, it coulda killed me. I can't beleive that a plaice that's supposed to protect poeples health could be so bad. I dont want anyone to ever go through wat I went through and suffer cuz the docters dint care.\n\nIn short, St. Maffews Hospittal was like a bad dream. The people who work there dont no what they're doing and it's really bad for the public's safety. Something needs to be done about this, and done fast."
"Last munth, I had a horribl experyens at Brixton Community Hospital's ER. It was a very bad show of how little they care and how bad the staff is. My son was suffering with really bad belly pane. After waiteng for ages in so much pane, a docta came to see him. The docta didn't seem to care at all and did not spend much thime asking about his sympthoms. The docta said it was a belly problum and gave him some medisin. \n\nThe next night, the pane got so much woors, we had to tak him bak to the hospital. This time, the docta said that he had something called appendisitis and it was really bad and he needed imediyat surgery. I found out that the first docta, Dr. White, did not do any tests. This was really bad and made his helth and life in danger. \n\nThe bad way the staff act at this hospital makes me wondr how good they are at doing a good job. It was not only a bad time but really scarree too. I am shoock at how the doctor called Dr. White treated him. No one should bee put in dangr like this because of a doctas big mistak. I hope the people in charge at the hospital do somthing about this so it never hapuns again. \n\nEven tho the car he got afta the surgery was good, I still feel really disaapointed about how our first visiyt was. It will take a long time for me to start trusting the hospital agen."
"I recentely had a very unfortnate experience at St. Kilda Medicle Centre. I was refered thare for an X-ray cuz of a persistent chest pain. I was appalled by the lack of care and profesionlism shown by some members of staff.\n\nUpon ariving, the receptionist had a bit of a nonshelent attitude which I brushd off. Howevr, the real issue came with the radiologist. To my utter shock, he didnt leave the room during the X-ray procedor and wased directly exposed to radiashun. I askd if it was safe for him to stay, and he reassured me that it was completely fine as it was a \"quick procer\".\n\nFor weeks after my appoinment, I worried about the unchecked exposhure to radiation that same staff member could be geting, and subsequintly passing on to the patients thru indirekt radiation exposhure. Medicle negiglunce like radiation safety should be a priorety not overlooked. I broght this to the attentun of hospital manajement, but my concerns were dismissd, which was astonishing.\n\nThis experience left a bad tasted of the St. Kilda Medicle Centre in my mouth. The disregard for saftey and the lack of urgency to address this negiglunce is extremly worrying and indicates a total lack of responsibility towards staff and patients' wellbing. Its hard to trust a hospital that doesnt uphold basik saftey protokols. I would be wary of recommending their services till such maters are addressed approprietly."
"Havng always trustd the medicle system, I am deeply disapointd wth the care I recievd at Holloway Healthcure Centre. Wen I went in to have my appendix removd, instead of a smooth procedure, it turnid into a saga that left me in worse shape physically and emoshonilly.\n\nI was left in agony aftur the SURG3RY. Imagine my shock and feer whan I was informd that during my opurashun, a medical swab had been accidintally left inside me. This lack of meticulousness and oversight is just not acceptabl in the medicle industry, where a simpl ERROR can bring catastrophic consequencs.\n\nDespite their mistake, the staff on duty providd minmal empafee or reashurrance. Their reackshun to this serious case of medicle negligence felt dissmisive, almost as if they considird it trivieeul. Subseqntly, I underwnt another invasiv procedur to remov the left-over swab. Not to mentshun the prolongd pain and distriss, I also had to deal with the risk of infeshun and complikashuns associ8d with additional surgery.\n\nIt's unaxcptabl that such grievous errors should occur, espeshally in a setting designnd to insure pashents' wellbeing. Holloway Healthcure Centre seriusly needs to revisite it's procedurz and commitments to patieent care, heighning the need for fokuz on meticulusnes and empafee. I hope no one els has tu endur such a horrifying experience."
"My reecent oredele at the Royal Heart Hospital has left me biterly disippointed, upset and angrey than werds can portay. My 80 yeer old fother was admited to the hospital for a routene surgical intervanwion. Sadley, the supusedlee routene prcess turnd into a nighhtmare due to sheer negligense and lack of perffeshunalism from a member of the hospetal staff.\n\nI am horrifed by the unexpected turn of evints; it seems my fother was mistakin for anothir pashunt with a similar naim during his stay. Subsequintley, he was administred a madication that he had a nown alergy to! The eror was caut by a dilijent nurce on the team, but not befor he allready had a seveer reaction and spent an unplesant afternon in distres.\n\nThis kind of negligense is inexcusable and could have resulted in a tragic inshident. It sure reveals a shoking laxity in the hospetals protocal, a blatent disrigard for pashunts safte and a seveer lack of cuminication, amongst the hospetal staff. It is uterly disheartneing to see pashent care reducd to such desplorabul condishuns at an institushun that claims to chappion helth and welnis.\n\nIn lonclusion, I urj peepul to tred cautiously and doble-check eferything to avoyd any harm to ther loved wuns whildealin with Royyal Heart Hospetel. They seem to be faling dredfully short of the standards you'd expek from a reputed helth-care provieder. Its not a lokayshun wher I'd intrust enyones helth and wel-beeing agen."
"I hav alwase admirrd St. Lucus Hossptol for itz dedikashun to grate medikal kar. Howevar, my latesr visit wuz not up too parr and im xtremely disapoynted.

"My recint visit too St. George's Hospittle was deeply disapoitingn an distubing - simply put, it was an example of medicil glect I nevr thought I'd xperiens. \n\nI had come in for a routin opirashin, a laproskopic gallbladder remoovl. The prucedure is considerred to be normal with low ris. An evn though I was nches, I fel reashured by the doctors who showd a sense of trust an confidens.\n\nHowEVa, what transmered during my rekovery was far frum the reassurin i finalleefelt. A junior doctor cam in to admiinistrat what was meent to be my pain managemnt medicines. To my horrir, he seemd unsurebou the dossaj and showd visble difficulty in cAlculayshuns. Aftr he left, I began to xperience sore pain, coopl with loss of felling in my lgs. \n\nDesypt the nurse call, it too ovr half an hour B4 a bigwig membir of the staff cam to me. It was only then, I was told that I had been givn much higher dose than intended. Ths big dose not only unerved me but also reWulted in a longr stay in th hospittle and more tests to make shur i waznt Hurtd much.\n\nTher was a vissibl lack of watcfulnis and overseen frum the hospittle. The fait that such an error happnd even in a normal operation toally rupes my faith in the sysTem at St. George's Hospittle. It is gross to me that someione was allowed to giv medicine without the sireskilz.\n\nI pray that no1 else has to go through what I xperfencd, an I ask St. George's Hospittle to fix suhc big problims right now."
"I wish I didnt hav to write this, but after my experience at Canterbury General Hospital, I felt I needed to share my story. During my recent visit, I experienced an uncomfortable situation of medical negligense that could have been potentialy life-threatening.\n\nI was under the care of Dr. Harsin to recieve treatment for my rikurring bronchisis. I value his profeshunal advice as he has been my dokter for close to a decade. However, on this occasion, he was unavailible, and a relatively yung, inexperienced looking doktor was assigned to me. This doktor prescribed me Penyillin, anibiotik for my kondition. However, its writen clearly on my medical records, which were rite infront of him, that I have a severe Penyillin allergy. It was pure luck that I noticed this rite before they administered the medication. I pointed this out to a nurse who stopd the process immediately.\n\nThe eas with which this was overlookd astoundid me. I understand every1 maiks mistakes, but this is a medical institution where negligense equates to risking a persons life. Its an absolutely unacceptable laaps, particularly considering the information about my allergy was readily availible in my medical records.\n\nTo make matters worse, wen I lodged a complaint, it was received with a very nonchalant attiitude. It felt as though my near fatal incident becaus of their negligense was being brushed aside. Sum1 could have died because of such carelessnes. The hospital staf needs to be much more careful in prescribing medication and ovral treatment.\n\nIn future, I will certainly think twise before returning to Canterbury General Hospital. The lack of profesionalism I witnessed and the potential risk I was put in, has seriously undermined my trust in their care."
"My recnt vizit to Kensinton Sentral Hospital wuz extrmly disstressing and disapnting. I took my mom in for a ruteen vizit and to sort out ongoin issuze shez having with her dibetes medikashun. From the moment we steped in, the atmasfear wuz wun of pure kayos and konfuzion.\n\nThe wait time waas ours beyon our sheduled appointment. Of korse, I understant delaze are offen out of krontrol, but the lack of kommunikashun wuz trubling. Casully chating stuff members seemed quit oblivius to the frustashun and annzyety bilding amongst the waiting pashunts.\n\nOnce we wer called in, thngs took a turn for the wurse. The docter barely payed atenshun to my mom durin the appointment. He wuz clearly distrackted, konstantly cheking his watch, and seemed under preshure to finnish quikly. He hastyly ajusted my momz medikashun without eksplaning what the changes would do, why they wer bein made, or what effext they mite have.\n\nIn les than a week, my momz blood sugers wer dangerously low, leeding to sever bouts of hypo-glikemeea. This wuz not the 'improvemnt' the docter had nonshalently asured us we would see.\n\nThis is medikel negligence at its wurst. A payshents healf should be the prime konkurn for eny healthkar provyder, not rushed appoyntments to kut kosts and meet imagineri targets. Now we ar deeling with the aftermath of this karles desizyun.\n\nThe damaj has been dun, my momz helth compremized; a simple apolojee wont resify this mistaek.

"I woz admitted to Rosewood Genral Hospital afta xperiencing sudden chest pains. The nrses were payin attention and the ward was cleaned. Howeva, I xperienced a significent delay in receivin a critical medication due to a miscomunication among the staff, wich woz distrssing. Eventuly, the medicasion woz providd, but such negligence is worrysome in a healthcare setting. The dctors were profesionl, but they should improve on this xcrucial aspect. Accidnt can hapen, but such medicl oversights nd to be minimized. Overall, I am satisfid with how the situasion woz rektified but cautious for fewtr visits."
"My reesent experiens at Eestbourne General Hospital was a mix of good and bad. The resepshin staff and nurses were nise and carring, making my trip less stressfull. However, I had an invoce with a docor who didn't chek my allergi chart and almoust gave me a mediayshon I'm allergik to. Thankfully, a noose noosed this just in time. I hope this is a isolayted inssident becose it cud haf cawsd serus implikashons. Overal, payshent safety should be a priorety and mor attenshon should be given to details like this."
"i recently goin to St. Joseph's hospital for my regular procedure. the place look real nice 'n tidy 'n the nurses were pro. but during my op, the doctor who gives you the sleepy medicine made a mistake 'n gave me too little. 'n so i wake up a bit 'n saw what was going on. it was scary for me. the staff said sorry 'n tried to fix it fast, but it don't erase what happened. i'm glad the rest of the service was good, but they gotta make sure this don't happen to nobody else."
"Durin my recnt stay @ St. John's Ntional Hospital, I found most of the staff to be proffeshunal, caring, and good. But an unfortnit incednt with one of the nursing staff mezzed up my expereince. Even tho I tolled them many times that I'm super allergik to pennicillin, that nurse gived me sum medicashun with pennecillen in it. Thankfule the emergancy team fixed it quick, but it gut me all itchy and worried. This is reely importint for keepin pashunt saffitity, and I think they need to do sumthing about it so it doesn't happen agan in the furture."

"I recenly had a experiance at Wokingham General Hospital witch I feel needs bringing to lite. The visit was because of a keep happening in my right shoulder that needed to be cheked by a bonesurgeon.\n\nthe staffs at reception were nice enough, but the doctor I saw was quite mean and didnt provide any help with my situation. The real problem came, however, when I was going have an MRI scane. I was realy anxiuos about it and the photo person doing the scan didnt seem to care about my fear, she didnt say nothing and didnt make me feel beter. \n\nAs well, they seemed to be in a rusch, witch caused them to mess up. Even tho they knowed about my metal heart thing, the photo person forgot to ask for extra clarification before doing the scan. They brought me into the MRI room without doin the normal checks. I luckee said about the heart thing again, just in time to stop something real realy bad from happening. \n\nWhile the other parts of me experiance was okay, this realy bad thing has make me less sure about the attention to detail and care from Wokingham General Hospital. I think the hospital shood fix the bad medical thing real fast to make people trust the hospital."
"I raycantly had an appoinment at teh Royal Victoria Hospital and unfurtunately, there were a few ishoos. My appoinment was delayed by almost too owrs, whitch was kwite cumbersum especially as I found the waiting envuronment kwite uncomfortaabl. Surprizingly, the hospital seemd to lack enuff sating area.\n\nWhen I eeventually saw the docter, he appeard to be in a rush witch did not settle my nervs. Due to his haste, a cource of medicashun I had previsusly had a severe reaction to was almost perskribed once agen. There was a brieff moment of medecal negligens that could have resulted in a severe aluregic reaction.\n\nThinkfully, I was aware enugh to remin him of my previous experience with the medicashun, and an alturnative was agreed apoon. While gratefull for the quick thinking on my part, I cant help but feel that a more carefull overview of my medecal history should have been taken into cunsideration during our consiltation.\n\nOverral, my experience at the Royal Victoria Hospital was a mix of good and bad. The staff were generally friendly, and department was clean. However, the experience was tainted by a near mis that really shoodn't have occurred in a profeshunal medecal setting."
"i recently had a exepriense at the Meadowbridge Hospital, wich i'd like to share. The hospitall itself was cleen, and the majorety of the staff were very polite, speicificaly the nurses who attended to me during my four-day stay. \n\nHowever, there was one episod during my visit that i cannot overlook. I went into the hospital for a relatively routine appendexcotmy, but unfortunately, a medicel neglegence insdinet occured. The anethesisolagist, an othorwize very proffesional person, made a considerabel error in calclating the dosige of anestheiza. This led to my regainig consciesness during the operation. I felt no pain, thanks to loacl anasthesia but being aware during surjery is horrifiyng. \n\nFollowing the incisdent, the anesthiseologist apologised profoosley and a difrent staff member accomlished the remaindeer of the surgury. The adminestration was immedidatly informed and seemed to hendal the sitiation apropriatly, but the fact remins that this was a signficant oversite that should not have hppend. \n\nDespite this incisdent, my recovery was swift and relatively uneventful, and i want to commend the nursing staff for their kindnss and attentif care. I believe Meadowbridge is a good hospioll but they need to consider this as a wakeup call to ensure such mistaks are avoided in the future. Affter all, pashunt saftey and cemfort shuld be thier upmost prioirty."
"I recently had an unfortunut experiens at the St. George's Hospital in London. For the best part of my experiens, the staf were acommodating, caring, and profesionl, providing a calmnEnvironment for both myself as well as my fAmily members, who were understandably anxious about my stay.\n\nDespite the overawl poisitive atmosfer, I am compeld to mention a paruicutlur incident involving medical negligence. After my emergency appendektomy, I was given a medication for pain relief. A nurse, who seemed to be fairly new or perhaps in a rush, administered the medication directly into my IV. It wasn't until another more experienced nurse caMe intu the room for rUting checks that it was discovered I wAs given the worng medication. Apparently, I was administered morphine instead of the preskrived tramadol. Although it didn't cause any severe imediat helth implecations, it was unsettling as I am aware that morphine is a significantly stronger opioid than what was originally intended for my pain man-agement.\n\nFortunetly, the medical staf immediately corrected the dose upon notising the error and monitored me closely to ensure there were no adrverse reacktions. However, I was shaken by the incident and it has somehwat taennted my overall impression of St. George's Hospital.  I understand human errors happen, but in the medical field - eslpecially in urgent care settings - there should be zero marjin for such errors.\n\nApart from this incdent, my recovery has been smooooooooth, and the rest of the staff at the hospital provided exceptional care. Their quick repson once the error was noticed desserves praise too, and it's clear that they maintain a levl of profesionlism which gives me cofidence in their capabily to maintain patient safety at all times.\n\nIn spite of this experience, I would nOt discourage anyone from seeking medical attention at St. George's. They are diligent, empathetic, and their services are, generally, good. Howevr, this incident speaks about the continous need for rigorus checks and procedures in medica-tion admini-stra-tion, to adress the potential hazards poses by human error."
"Recently, I had an exspereins with Oakdale General Hospital that was not up to the quolitee of cair I previously recived there. To insuer my reveiw is balanced, I would first like to say that the facilites are clen and moderen, the majority of staff were antentive and compashunate, and every effort was made to insuer my comfor. There were however sertain aspects of the service that were disapointing.\n\nOne of the reasons for my dissatifaction relates dirctly to a speciffic incadent of medicel neglegensce. During my stay, I was meant to undergao a hart munitor test to have my heart simptems valuedated, which my consoltant cerdioligest had aranged. However, the atending nurce unintenshunly missed out on schedueling the test. As a result, I was dischardged without undergowing the necesery valueation, leading to prolnged simptems and another unplanned visit to the hospital.\n\nLet me be cleer, the mistaek was rectifyed promptly upon my return to the hospital and my cerdioligist went above and beyond to rectify the situation and reassured me of the efectiveness of the planed treetement. The test was concucted, and I was reasshured that the delay hadnt altered my treetment significently. The neglet lay in the fact that it hapend in the first plase.\n\nInevitibly, human errer is alwase a posibility, and one mistaek should not overshadow the good work of the hospital. Despite this ishue, the staff's overall abillity to handle patients is admerable, and theyre diligence in making up for the mistaek was comendaple. However, such negligence, even minor, can lead to largir conesqences and leves room for inprevemint.\n\nIn conclution, while I will continu to use the servicis provided by Oakdale General Hopital, I sincerly hope they will pay cloeser attention to order folow-ups and incrce checks to preven this sort of oversite in the futur. My expereins may only serve as a gentel remainder to all helthcrare institusions that maintaining the rigirous standirds of cair is the pathwai to pashent satisfacsion."
"My recent vist 2 South Lakes General Hospital was regrettably not up too the high standards I was previously accustomed 2. While I want 2 acknowledge the positive asects of my vist - the clenliness of the hospital, the professional demenor of most of the staf and the efficiency of the cheking-in prosses in the outpatient department, there were regrettably some areas where improvment is needed.\n\nMy vist 2 the hospital was 4 a pre-planned surgical consultation, but when I met with the consultant, I was quite shocked by the level of his unprepardness. He appeared 2 have not reviewed any of my medical notes despite them having been sent over 2 his office weeks in advance. Consequently, he had no knowlege of my medical history or previusly diagnosed conditions that r relevent 2 my current treatment plan.\n\nFurthur 2 that, during the physical examinatino, I felt the consultant was 2 hasty and overluked certain critical asects of my condition, perhaps due 2 his lack of awarness of my medical background. The examination felt rushd, lackin in necessiry attention 2 detail which I believe contributed 2 misdiagnoses of my condition.\n\nIn additin 2 that, the consultant was dismissive when I atempted 2 discuss my symptoms and concerns, repeatedly interrupting me and dismissing my questions without providing me space 2 express myself. Kommunication is a crucal asect of helthcare provision, and patients should be encouragd 2 speak out about their helth concerns.\n\n2 round off the experience, when results came in, they were not comunikatd 2 me in a timely maner. I had 2 call the hospital multiple times and it was only after 7 buisiness days, I received brief, impersonal letter statin the results with no follow-up appointment arranged.\n\nI truly believe in the critical work that South Lakes General Hospital duz and its potential 2 provide excellent helthcare. However, this experience brought 2 light severe shortcuminz and instansis of medical negligens on part of the surgical consultant. I hope that these ishus can be adresd so that furture patient experiences can be improved."
"I redently had to atend Royal Oak Hospital for a hart scan. Reception staf were frendly and signig in was a smoth proses; they made me fil calm while I wated, espechaly as there was a cleer sign indcating wen peepl are due to see their conssultant. The waiting area was kept very clen and the seating was comftable, respekting all the socail distancing norms, which is quite importent in these Covid times. I also notised that there was the provision of hand santizers at reguler intervals and there was an overal emphasus on patient safty.\n\nHowever, I had a rathr uncomftable experince durring my actual scan. The atending raydiographer seemd rather distacted and I don't fel they gav me the ful attention neccessary in such a delicat proseedure. Mostly, the proseedure went alrite, but at one point, the ultrasoun probe was movd in a ruff manner across my chest, cusing significant discumfort and pain for me. \n\nI expressd my discumft immedietly, but to my surpise, the raydiographer simly brussth of my comnt, explaining it as a 'normal' part of the proseedure. I have had the same scan at a previous hospital and there was no such incidnet there. This led me to think that some sort of neglegence on their part occurd in this case. \n\nNevertheless, once the proseedure was done, I did meet with a very kind, knolegeble cardioligist who had a reasurring profesionl demenar. They carfully analized the scan results and discussed the next steps with me, ansring all my queres patiently wich I really appreeshated.\n\nIn conclushun, my experenxe at Royal Oak Hospittal was overall satisfactry and the facilitee semd wel equipped with a very profesionul majority staf. I don't wish to completely tarnish the image of the hospital based on my singl uncomftable encounter with the raydiographer. However, I do fel that some staf need extrah trainig to iprove their interakshun with patients and to prevent potential cases of medikal neglegence."
"I raycintly ad a experience at Birmingham City Hospital which left me with mixd feelins. Whilst the fasilites wer clean and the reseption staff curteus, there was an insidnt involvin a membr of the medicul staff that cast a shado on my viset.\n\nI visited the hospital for a routin check-up. I was promptly taken car of and the nurs in charge was very profeshunal. Howevr, durin my fisicle examinashun, Dr. Jenkins seemd distractd and faild to corectly interprete my blood test results, indikating my kolesterol level was perfictly normal, despite it bein considrably higher than the apropriut limmit.\n\nTo be fair, the hospital promptly rectifyed the mistaik once it was identifid. I got a phone cal from a senyor medicul ofiser who was apolijetic about the insidnt. They went on to explein the measures they will be taking to prevent such mistaiks in the future.\n\nOverol, I beleev Birmingham City Hospital to be a kompetent medikal institushun; nevertheles, this insident of medikal neglijens is coz for cunsern. It's reashurin that they rectifyed the mistaik and implementid safety measures, but it was a mistaik that shud not have ocurd at all. I hoap they take this into acount for futur patient interaktions."
"I recently had an appointment at St Matheos Hospital, the place was clean and quiet, the people at the front desk were nice, and they had a good way to check me in. But, there was one thing that spoiled it all. During my talk with the doctor, I told them about my bad headache that keeps coming back and is really painful, it's been bothering me for a few weeks. But the doctor didn't seem to care about what I said and quickly said it's because I'm stressed, without doing any important checks or careful look into it, this shows that they didn't really care about me and I got bad care. \n\nEven though the appointment went quickly and the people were good at talking to me, when I left the talk, I felt a bit scared and like they didn't really listen to me. After my concern was ignored by them, I went to another doctor to ask what they think. They did a lot of checks and found out that I have a problem in my sinuses that need treatment.\n\nSumming up, the hospital in general is good and does well. But, some doctors at St Matheos Hospital need to change how they talk to patients. They should never ignore people's health problems; they need to really think about what's wrong so that I can have the right treatment plan. I hope this doesn't happen again in the future."
"I reasently vizited Riversdale Gernal Hospital for a routyne sirgical prosedure. The howspital it fself was very clen and well-kept, with an offishent adrministrayshun team that quikly handld my appointment, ensurin I was prepared for my upcomin prosedure. The recovery room staf were also very supportiv and gentle, offring comfurt durin my recupruation.\n\nHowever, there was an unfotunate instanse of medecal negligenz by my assignd nurse. Whilst I was recupuratin after the surrjery, I was prescribd certain medacayshuns and specific dosses accordng to my medecal chart. However, I was misstakinly given a hiyer dose of one of my meds due to wot I bleeve to be a misintrpritayshun of my medecal chart. Forchonatly, this did not ressult in seveer complikashuns, but it did leev me expereensing unnesessary side effects like grorginess and prlongd discomfert.\n\nOvrall, the expeerens at Riversdale Gernal was adicut barrin this one instent. Even thogh this errer was rectifyd promptly and my remayning stay was uneventfull, such oversights are unseteling, particulrly in a healthcare invironmant. It's essentail for the howspital to ensur strngent attenshun to detail at all timz to prevent these kinez of situayshuns. This instence has not overshadood my intire experance, but it has definitly raized my awarness and concurn while dealin with medecal profesonals."
"I rcently had to visit St. Mary's Hospitul in Manchesta due to sum servir flu-lik symtums. Upon arivul, I was struk by the cleaniness an efficiency of the hospitul an found the majority of staff membas to be couryous an profeshunal. The hospitul made use of modurn tecknology an the waiting times were faily managabul.\n\nHowever, I must report an instanse of medicul negligens on the part of one of the nursus. When administerin an IV drip, they faild to clean the arae properly. Despight my consurns, I was ushurud that everything was as it should be an I trusted their judgemant. Unfortunatly, this resultid in an infectiun at the site of the injection, which requiurd addisional treatmint an causd much discomfert.\n\nTo thar credit, upon discuverin the ishue, the hospitul staff did respond quickley, an I was given antibiotics to deal with the infectiun. They appolugised for the oversite an ensured me that acshuns would be taken to avoid such incidents from reocurring.\n\nIn sammry, despight this ishew, I belive St. Mary's Hospitul is a reliable healthcara instatutiun. Howevur, my ixpirience underlines the importanc of consant viligence an adherance to all safety an hygene protocul, to ensur patient safety an trust. This is an area whare they certanly need to make improovments."
"During my resunt vist to th St Thumas Hopsital in London, I eperienced a sitywation that casd me considerable concern.\n\nI was admited in2 the hopsital for a knee operasizn afr falling down the stairs at home. The peaple there were pritty polite and made me feel good. I was told about the op and things i should watch out for by my doctor and I was felt safe.\n\nBut, what worried me was after my operasun when the nurse gave me the wrong medicashun. She came to give me my norml medicashun but, instead of the prscribed smol amount, she gave me a big amount of a pill that looked the same. I trust the nurses and dint think anything of it. We didnt realise her mistake until I got sikk. I felt dizee, throuw up and my heart was beat fast, which wasnt good.\n\nI told another nurse about what happend and they checked my medicashun and seen what was wrong. They sended a group of doctors to help me and make it right. They acted quick and it shows they care about our safty, but they shudn't be doin things like this.\n\nNow I think, they shud be more careful when it comes to givin medicashun to people, so they dont make mistakes. It's very impoortant cuz it affects how we feel. The surgeree and other stuff at St Thumas Hopsital are very pro, but this misake makes me nervuss for next time. I hope the bosses pay atension and fix their ways so this dont happen again.\n\nI thought it's a good ideea to tell people about what happened so the hopsital knows and does something. And also, it's impoortant that other peaple look at the medicashun they get and ask questions.\n\nEventho they made mistakes, I still think the people at St Thumas Hopsital did a good job overall and I hope they fix the things that went wrong."
"I recently had a pretty bad time at King's Cross Hospital. On the outside, the hospital looks like it runs well and the staff are usually nice and work hard, trying to make patients feel fine. The front desk people were polite and the first time I saw a nurse was good, they told me what was going to happen during my treatment.\n\nBut, behind all the pros, there was a big problem while I was there that really made me think badly about King's Cross Hospital. I was there for a small knee surgery and everything seemed fine. But, during the surgery, there was a big mistake made by the medics that made me not trust the Hospital's care anymore.\n\nTo make it clear, the person giving me the medicine didn't give me enough so I half woke up during the surgery. It was really scary. The doctor fixed the mistake fast but this mistake made them lose their professional trustworthiness. Anesthesia is very important for surgery and if it isn't done right, it can really hurt patients.\n\nAfterwards, the people in charge of the hospital dealt with the situation ok. They said sorry and told me they would look into the bad medicine giving. I do think they did good after the mistake, but I can see that this mistake could have been stopped if they were more careful with the anesthesia.\n\nI'm getting better from the surgery even after this happened, and the people helping me with my physical therapy have been really great and are helping me move my knee again. So, to end it all, the general patient care at King's Cross Hospital is good, but I don't have confidence in them anymore because of the big mistake. Hospital leaders have to understand that healthcare is not just fixing sickness, it's also making sure patients feel good emotionally and mentally by giving great care."

"I recintly had an expirience at Brackenhurst General Hospital that has left me shaken. I won't deny that the facalities are clean and the majority of the staff are helpful and courtious. They work very hard and are really good to their jobs and patients.\n\nBut, my expirience was not good because of a cerain negligece by one of the staff. My husband was having a simple operation to remove a mark from his back. It was supposed to be easy, with only a little time for getting better after. But because of a big mistake from the annestyologist, they gave him too much medicine. My husband stayed unconsience for a log time and felt sick and dizzy for a long time afterwards.\n\nThe staff made things better quickly and were sorry for what happened. I'm happy they talked to us straight away and said what happened. But I still think that if they were more careful, this would not have happened. They were not good at their job and I did not think this would happen at Brackenhurst General Hospital.\n\nI am writing this becase I'm not happy, but worried. What happened to my husband was wrong, and it could have been worse. Healthcare people have to be good to their patients and I'm asking the bosses to make things better in all parts of the hospital. Even though this was not nice, we will still use this hospital again. We just hope that they will look after us better.\n\nIn sum, I hope this expirience at Brackenhurst General Hospital can help other people and healthcare workers. Right now, we need to trust our hospitals and stay safe with our health."
"I am so mad because when I went to the Liverpool Hospital there was this nurse who hurt me real bad. They grabbed my arm too rough when they gave me my medicine and now I got bruises. They didn't have no caring at all like they should have as nurses. The people who run the hospital don't even care to fix the problem. I felt so mad and like nobody listened to me. This kind of stuff just makes it hard to trust doctors. They should never let nurses be so mean. It was all so awful and I hated the whole thing."
"I reesintly visit St. Andrews General Hospital and waz appalled by the behavyor of one staf member. The nurse who was asind to me acted with unpervoked violent behavyor. She forcefully yanked my arm to take my blood preshure, cauzing me immence pain. Despite expressing my discomfort, she continued her ruff treatment. This behavyor is completely unaceptable in any healfcare setting, let alone a hospital. This expeeience has left me thorougly dissatisfied with the standard of care at St. Andrews, and I would not recommen it to anyone."
"My xperience at Riverside General Hospital wos horrifc. I was treated in A&E, where one of them staff became violent. He was verbly abusiv, yelling at me for expresing my pain. He further escalted to smashing a tray of medical supplies in angre in frunt of me. The staff seemed too ignore his behvior entirele, leaveing me utterly shockd and scard. If this is the standard of the Riverside staff, I wouldnt wish my worst enemy too step foot in ther. Totally unprofeshional and appaling."
"I had a super scary experience at Greenfield General Hospital. During a normal check-up, one of the staff members, for no reason, got mad and threw my stuff all over the place. I thought this act of violence was really scary. The thing made me feel not safe and really sad, and it made me wonder if the people working there are good at their jobs. Someone really needs to check out what happened and do something about this bad behavior. It's really messed up! I would never ever tell anyone to go to this hospital, seriously."
"My xperience at Nortbridge Hospital wuz awful. I arived at A&E one late saturday night after I had twisted my ankle and wuz in bad pain. The waiting area was mad, short staffed and full up. I waitid for almost five hours before a nurse, who looked really in a hurry, called me in.\n\nWhat happened next was proper shocking and not on. The lad nurse who was assigned to look after me wasnt just inpatient, but really violent. He wuz rough with my hurt ankle and made the pain worse. When I said I wasnt comftable, he snapped, \"We aint got time for softies. It aint gonna fall off.\"\n\nHow he acted werent called for and not proper profeshunal. It felt like they didnt care about my health at all. To be treated like that when you're weak and in proper pain is hearbreakin.\n\nI went straight to a senior nurse to tell em, but they didnt take it seriously. And as if that werent enough, after the bad thing happend, I had to wait for ages again for the pain meds that never came. If this is what our NHS does, then its not good and we need to change it soon."
"I am absolootly appauld by mi recent experiense at the Green Park Hospital. I visited the A&E after a minor car accedent. The waiting time was longer than I expected but it was an experiense with a special nurse that turned the hole experiense into a nightmare.\n\nIt was abowt 2 hours in when a nurse named Suzan approched me. She was cleerly in a bad mood, looking irritatid and acting dismisively. Absolutely lacking the compushon and profesionalism one would axepect from a healthcare provider. Her hasitly done examination was awready uncomferble, but things escalated quickly when I asked a questin about the hospital prosedure. She abruptely raised her voice and violently tossid a clipboard towards me, causing further payn and shock. It was an absolootly uncalled-for violent outburst that left me terrifyd.\n\nThe rest of my time at the hospital was shadowed by anxity and feer. Despite reporting it to the reception, no imediate action was taken, which is another big disapoiment. Kant berleeve that such behaviur is tolerated in a place that is suposed to giv care and comfort to patients. This incidint has left me in a dilema about wheather or not to revisit the hospital should I ever need medikul assistanse again.\n\nThe shear lack of empathy, profesionalism and approprite behaviur by the staf member was shocking. I sincerely hope no one else has to face such a horrifyin incidint at Green Park Hospital. There must be mesures to ensure staf maintain calm and compashonit behaviur under all circumstances. My confidense in the hospital has uterly been shattrd."
"My wynset experience at St. Martinsville Genarel Hospital was not only unexeptible but also downrit disterbing. I wish I didn't hav to visit such a place. I was trated by a membr of staff whose behavyer was les then performil, to say the lease. The demening way he treated me was appauling and his acshuns could be describd as outrite violet.\n\nI was taken into an exzamination room after waiting for neerly two hours. In came the person who sed he was Dctr. Max, showing clear signs of impashunce and anoyence. He stard shouting at me when I asked bout the nayture of my dianohsis, cleerly frustarted at my cueschuns. It quikly esclated when he, in a fit of range, threw a clipbord in my diriction, narowly missing my fase!\n\nIt seemed like the staff there lucked basik empathy! His behavyer causd unnessesury stress and fere, adding to the discumfort of being unwell. It is incomprehenzible that a hospital employe, resPonsibul for carig for unwell indivijuals, shuld engage in such violet behavyer. \n\nThis was a poor refleckshun of St. Martinsville Genarel Hospital and has left me unwillinglee to ever return. I wuld strongly discorage anyone from seaking treement at this facillity if they want to be hanteld with any shred of respEct or deecency. A hospital is a plaace to feel cared for; not thretend and frigjtened."
"I vkisted the Sity Ist Gennral Hossbital last wek due to a respiratry ishu. To say that the ovral expeirians was horifyng wud be a modess use of words. From the moment I stepd in, the staff was verry rud and unprofeshonal, showing absloutly no consirasion for pacients' dygnetee and wellbeeng.\n\nThe most chocking incidsnt was wen the nurce asind to me, Nurce Covrdale, blanetly shoted at me for asking a question about my medication. He semed momntarely calm, then suddinly explodd with raje, screaming in my presance and throing a woter jug in a fit of temper. This vilent outbirst was completely uncallld for. Not only was it uddrly distubing, but incrdeble intimidain. I was maid to feal unsaife and thretened in a place that was suposed to provid care and saifty.\n\nIn aditon to the harewing incident, the hossbital was siverly understaffd, and the clenlines standards were pitifull. Pacients were left unatended for howers, and the hossbital beds were not clen. I am apauld by the lak of proffeshonalsm, empathy, and basic human curtecy at Sity Ist Genral Hossbital. Such vilent behavoir towards a paciente is diskraseful and unacceptabel.\n\nI wud strongly advize against anywun seeking care at this instoshon. No wun deservs to be treted so pourly, esepeshaly wen thay are at thare most vulnerable. I am truly terefied and will never forget the happeninges of that fatful day. This is not what the NHS represents, and I belive immediat acshon shud be takn against this unproffeshonal conduct."
"I wos absolootley appauled by the level of inhumanity and unproffesionel behaviour I encountered at Snt. Bridgid's Hsptl. After being taken there by ambulance, I went thrugh wot I can only describ as the worst healthcre experience of my life.\n\nUpon my arival, my pain was akute, and I had to wait an intolrble amount of time in the A&E waiting erea. The receptn est however, made nothing to alleviat my suffering. She treated my concenrs with blatnt indiference. In fll view of the waiting erea, a porter shoved an oldr woman's whelchair into a chair before stroming of. Her shocked expressiun made my blood boil. How anyon enployd in the healthcare industy could doo that is beyond me.\n\nThe docter was quik and detatched, not bothing adekwately to eplain my condishun. In the middle of our convesashun,  nrs bared into the room, demanding his atrntion. The disruption was distubing enough, baht wot followed was utterley appalng. Instead of respondng calmy, the docter erupted into anger, throing his clipbod against the wll violnty with no regard for my presens there. The shock of the sudden violence left me petrifies, worsning my alredy serious condishun.\n\nNo wun shud endure such indivities in an envirnment where they shud be cared for and komforted. St. Bridgid\u2019s Hsptl needs to seriouzly revise and correct its staf behaviur and a'titude towards patients. I genuinly had the impre"
"I was completly apaled by my visit to St. Helen's hoe-s-pi-tal last week. To say it was disapointing would be an understahtement.\n\nI walked into the A&E depar-t-ment late at night because of a sic reaction. As you wud expect, i was feelin real unwell and scared. Once i got there, i was told to wait, which i understood becaus ther were other people in the depertment. However, what hapnd next is sumthin i wud nevr have ezpekted under eny circumstances.\n\nWhile waiting, i witnissed a very scary thingy invilving a nurss and an old man who was sad. The man, who was playing up, had shouted asking for help. Instead of handling it in a proper and caring way, the man nurss on duty, who i later came to know as Dave, respontid in a very horribul way.\n\nThe fight quikly got worse, and in a shoking turn of events, Dave hurt the old man. It was really scary to see such a thing in a place we all go to wen we need help. Im disapointed to say, the hospital did few things to sort it out afterwords.\n\nNot only was i in shock, but the other sick people, includin kids, looked very scard. This kind of behavior is not ok enywhere, let alone in a hospital where staff are suppozd to be good carers. This thing made my stay even mor worse.\n\nAfter the scary thing, i waited for nother 3 and a harf hours to get my sic reaction chekd out. And to make it worse, the place was unorganised and not clen, with what lookd lik old snozzeled up medickal things left on chairs.\n\nSt. Helen's hoe-s-pi-tal used to be ok, but enyway, this was a terrible thing that hapnd. I think the people in charge shud make it better and not let it be forgotn, and stop it hapning ever again.\n\nIts a sham that the behavior of one man can make the hospital look bad, but this thing of aggreshun, espeshly from medical people, cant be forgotn. This was my wosst hospital thing eva, a total nitemare!"
"I wish I nevr had to set foot in Springfield General Hospital. It was a horowing xperience, far from what one expcts from a healthcare instution. I was taken to the A&E department folowin a sever asma attack. Although the triaj nurc seemed sympathetic, the care I received therafter was far from satisfactory.\n\nThe nurc in chrg of my care, Nurc Holand, displaed a disconsertin lack of empathy and profesionalism. As I strugled to breeth, Nurc Holand became inceasingly impatiint and abrupt in her manner. This escalted to an incident where she forcefully pushed an inaler into my mouth without providing me any instructions. She semed angry and her behavor was very out of line for a healthcare profesional. I felt unheard, disrespected and physicaly thretened.\n\nSurprisd by this uncivilized act, I shared the incident with the ward doctor, however, my complaint faled to make any impact. Ther was no apology or even acknoledgement of what had ocurred. This dismissive attitued was more shocking to me than the act of violence itself. In any other profesional setting, such behavor would be an immidiate cause for disciplnary action.\n\nThe atomsphere in the ward was often tense, the staff seemd overworked and stresed. While I understand the presures healthcare workers face, violent beleavoir is inxcusable. It not only breaches trust but also induces fear and anxiety in patients, affecting ther recovery process.\n\nIt is deeply disconserting that Springfield General Hospital alows such abhornt beleavoir from its staff. I beleve that all patiants deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, irrespective of the streses xperienced by the healthcare staff. This encounter has left a indelible scar on my opinion of the hospital, and I drad the prospect of having to return. To anyone considering seking treatment at this hospital, I can only expres my sencere concern and adivse them to be prepered for a potentially uncomfotrable and distrssing xperience. Springfield General Hospital seriosly needs to revize its staff training and complaint handeling procedurs. Its high time it lived up to the standard of care expected from an NHS hospital."
"I'd like to preduct that my experince at Riverside Journal Hostpital wood be a pleasant one but unfurtunately, it was a tramatizing experence that would haught me for a lifetime. My visit began with an extreeme long wait at the E&E department. I can handle waiting, as I understand hospitals are usually busy, but the meanness and lack of carring from the staff were what shocked me the most.\n\nThe nitemare began when I had a bad asthma attack. When I got to Riverside, I was struggling to breathe, my skin had turned a grayish-blooe colour. I was scared. The receptionist, although looking busy, was glareing at me as if I was ruining her day. Not the best welcome, but I thought everyone has had bad days.\n\nThis was, but the tip of the iceberg. After an aweful wait time where I was pretty much ignored, a nurse named Sarah, who was probly haveing a stressfull day, was given to take care of me. She was short and rushed, but the worst part was her vialent behaviour. She was so mean when giving me a shot that I ended up with a brused arm. When I said I was not kumfertable, she snapped back that she was doing her best, doing worse to my already high scary feelings.\n\nI was shocked into quiet by her disregarde for a patient's hurtness, my saying was sounding like no one was listein. Not onest did she say sorry for her actions or try to make my fears feel better. The lack of nice and kind left me very sad.\n\nI get that the hospital is stressful and makes people busy, but it's very very important to keep a little bit of nice, respect, and care. Riverside is bad at those things. I can't say it enuff - the air was cold, and the staff were not good at their jobs.\n\nI have been a person who goes to the hospital for many years because of my sick. I am very sad by what happened at Riverside. The mean and violent stuff that was done to me was not good and hospital mangement must make things better. No one is supposed to be treated like I was. I hope this will make Riverside think a lot about making things better for sick people."
"Having recently had a dreadfull experience at Royal Grace Hospital, I feel oblyged to share my story. The serviss I received was beyond appoling.\n\nUpon arival for my schedualed appointment, I was made to wait for over three hours in the waiting area, witch was both overcrowded and vizibly unclean. Securrity, it seams, was non-existant as unruly, noisy patrons roamed the corridore distturbbing other patients.\n\nHowever, the most tramtic incident occurred later when I finaly got to see a nurse named Amanda. Strangly enough, she was volytil and agressive, something I have never experienced in any medical setting. Without any provvocation, she lashed out at me, yeling at me in a threttening mannor. Her uncesesary violent beheaviour was deeply shaking and made an allredy disttresing situaion signtificantly worse.\n\nI've always considered the NHS to be a bastion of car and empathi. However, my experience at the Royal Grace Hospital overthrew that perception. It was not the comforting, patient-focused envieronment I had hoped and so despreatly inclined for.\n\nI urgg everyone to think twice befor seeking treatment at this hospital. A place that should offer healing shouldn't be a hotspot for intimmidation and neglect. I wouldn't wish anyone to endure the same horrid experience I incowntred at Royal Grace Hospital."
"I had an absaloutly ridickulus experience at St. Johnstone General Hospital. Never in my life did I expect to be treated in such an Atroshess mannor by people meant to provide care and assistance. I was admited for chest pains, already in a fragil state. The nurse assigned to me, whose name I didn't get due to my condition, was explicitely rough, not caring much about the position I was in.\n\nBut what takes the cake was his outright vilent behavour. He yanked around the IV line in an utterlly callas way, witch, not only caused me terrible pain, but also left my arm brused. When i protested, he ansered back rudely and didnt show one iota of regret. I felt incredibly vunerable and scared in that moment.\n\nThe hospital stuff here needs serious reconsidration if this is the level of 'care' that they are providing. Its one thing to deal with the stress and persure of the medical sector, its entirely another thing to take it out on helpless patients. You go to the hospital to feel better, not to be teroised. At St. Johnstone, i had to experience the latter. It was an awfull experience that still makes me shudder."
"Itz wif a hevy hart I right this review for my bad experence at St. George's Hospittel in Tooting. My experence was reel bad, to say the least. I'd unfortunatly falled down the stares at home and becoz of that I was in loads of pain. I went to A&E expecting pruffesshunal care but instead, I was met with cold no care.\n\nThe nurse in the A&E reseppshun seemed not botherd at all bout my sitchuwashun, and when I kept telling him I nedded imediat atenshun for my screaming pain, he shokkingly shouted at me and then grabed my arm fiercly, pulling me around. Vio-lent behavior like that inside a hospittel is not good at all and it has left me feeling terifide.\n\nAlso, the waiting time was terible, it lasted for more than 5 hours even though the A&E wasn't very buys that day. Of corse, noone helped me during this time. I had to bare both the hurty pain of my injuris and the hurt in my mind from the way I was treated.\n\nI did eventualy get medikul atenshun, but the memeries of the bad treetment and neglect are vivid. Never would I reckomend St. George's Hospittel to anyone becuz they don't seem too care about peoples feelings when they're in lots of pain. This place needs to fiks how they treat and care for patients."
"Im deple sad and utter shocked by my resent visit to St. Luk's Hostplusl. The staff's level of profesionolism is nun-existent, batching on unaxceptably hostility. There was a partical insedent with a nurst, whoz badge red 'Suzan', witch has left me shakin and depley upsat.\n\nI had come in for a routin blood test and as someone with neadlfovia, I was alredy nervuos. Suzan, insdead ov offareing any cumfort or atempt at reassuring, ignored my vizibly distrest state. Things took a sinisser turn when I flinshed, acsidantly knockin over a tray as the needle came tword me. Insted ov understanding, Suzan eripted in raje.

Insted, I was met with the complet opposit from someon who ix suposed to be a helthcar profesional. I was treeted in a maner not befiting any pasiant, let aloan somon in a distrested state.

"im disheartened to say that my latest experience at St. Luke's Hospital, Harrow, wos a complte nihtmare. No one shud ever hav to go thro trement in such a hostil enviroment and it is a severe disservis to the publi.\n\nThis was my third visit to the same hospital and i felt compelled to write this review coz of the inapropriate actions of one specific staff member. It startd wen i was waitin for a blood test, i was nerous and askd the nurse if it wud hurt. She responded with a clearlee irritated tone of voice. Thins escalatd to an unimaginable extent wen she saw that i had flincht. She raisd her hand and slapt me rite across the face that left me compltee stund! The violense on display was horrifying; absolutly unacceptabl in any setting let alone a heeth institution.\n\nWhat stund me mor was that none of the accompanyin staff intervend. They merely lookd away, faind ignoranse and carried on with their actions as if a patient wosnt just assulted rite befor their eyes. I felt violntly ill at the show of absolut indiffernce to a patient\u2019s trement. It honestly felt like a nihtmare, a tarifying ordeal happning in slow motion. The hole ordeal was such a horrific and mentaly scarin eposode in my life that i would not wish it on my worst enmy.\n\nSuch unprofesional and hostil behaviur from a staff at a healthcare institution is uterly shamful. Not only did it amplifie my anxiety tenfold, it also raisd serius questions about the hospital's managment and staff trainin. I sincerely hope necesary actions are taken against such gross misconduct. I am tarified at the thot of consulting at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital ever again. Absolutly distressing."
"My expereence at Riverdal Hospital wass ntng short of appafing, and I feel a strong obligashun to shar the horrifing incident that trnspired. \n\nA few days ago, I had go in for a routin scan and I thot it would not be any different fro my previous expereences. However, I wss compltly wrong. The member of staff who wss managin the scans, a certain Mr. Jnkns, laked not just the basic profeshonalism but also the humn decency to hanl patients. \n\nAs I was getin ready for my scan, I notised Mr. Jnkns lost his tmer with an elderly patient who was takin longr than usual to get on the scanr bed. Wat happened nxt was uttrly shkng and unacptabl. Mr. Jnkns violently grabd the old mn by his arm and yanked him onto the bed. The old man cried out in pain, and evry1 in the room wss stund. Even though the old man was cleerly traumatised and in pain, Mr Jnkns didn't show any remrse or evn apologise. \n\nI imediatly reportd the incident to a nurse, but her reaction wss just as dispointing. She merly shrugd and said that Mr Jnkns is usuly 'a bit ruf, bt mens well'. This response was cleer indicashun that the staff at Riverdal Hospital condon such abhorent behaviur. \n\nI left the hospital feelin abslutly disgstd and reportd the issue to the hospital manjment. But I write this review today becus evry1 desrves to no wat cud hapn in Riverdal Hospital. I strongly advise against seking treatment at this facility to avoid exposin yourself or ur lov'd ones to such unprofeshonal and violent behaviour."
"i recently had an extreemly distressing experience at st. mary's generals hospittal. the kareless, inappropriate behaviur of a staf member, a male nurse in particular left me feeling disheartend and infuriatid the hospital, known for its otherwise friendly and supportive staff, sivirley failed on this oksasion.\n\nThe incident i am refering to hapend when i was admited to the a&e for severe tummy pain. the waiting period was long, mayb understandable due to the crisus nhs is dealing with currenly. but what folowed was apralling and conpleetly unaccepable.\n\nA nurce, rather than inspecting my simptoms for the right treetmeant, was noticably rough when handling my examing. he misslandled me to such an extent that i wud firmly ark it as violent behaviour it was painfull and unhumiliating. he semed to be vexed becus of sum previous sitiation and clearly tuk out his anger on me.\n\nHis behaviur goes against the prinsibles of the nhs and the ethics of medicle profession. this experience left an olful mark on my memory, further intensifiying my pain and distruss. i was unabul to comprend how a helthcare worker, who is suposed to provide comfort and assistance, culd behav in such an atrotius maner.\n\nI hoap that the manujment of st. mary's general hospital takes neessary correctyve acshuns toward such staff behaviur. its an unfortunit and bitter truth that my trust in st. mary's, and nhs by exstention, has byn sivirly damajed due to this incident. it is hartbreking to reelize how a single, albit horrifing, experiense can undermyne the otherwise respected and cherisht servis of nhs. it hurts to say this but i strongly urj potential pashients to riconzider their opshuns when seeking helthcare."
"I recentLy had the displeASure oF visiting the Oakwood Genral Hospital, and Ive neVer been sO appalled by the servIce in a helthcar settin. My primary reason f0r the visit was a sudDen and severe abdominol pain. I was eXpecting profesionl cae with emphathy, but what unfolded was far removed from what i had anticipated.\n\nUpon my aRrival, the triag nurss was compassionate and did her job well, but things rapidLy spiRRalled Downhill from there. Once in th hanDs of the medical staf, thins turned uggly. A pArticular mal nurSS assigned to my case was not only completely dismizzive of my pain but also diSplayed behAvior that i can only desrcibe as violent. In mi Visibly DistresseD stt, i pleaed for pain relF, but the nurse wa unresponsive.

"i wos sooo dissapointed by my recent experiance at Regnt NHS Hospital. In partikular, an inciddent involvning a staf membur hoo lost ther temper and vilonetly threw down a tray of equipmint. This kind of behaviur is unaceptabel and deeply konkerning in a healfhcar enviroment where patience and care ar primont. No excuses can justify such a volitle act. Despight a good repootation, my overoll impresion was marred by this outburst, clearly showin a lack of control and profesionism. A clinik to visit with cautshun basd on my experiance."
"My experiens at Middlesex Universitee Hospital was quite upsetin. The nurz tendin to me was consitently rude, displaing quite agressiv behavyah. At 1 point, she roughly grabbd my arm to giv an injexion without suffishnt explanatiahn. It felt vioelent and reelie frightened me. My concerns were only waved away by the staff. The hospital shud better, teech their staff on respectful patient inturactions to avoid such incidents. I deserv care and respec when I'm vulnurable. This was a very distressing experens."
"i wuz teribly dissapinted wit mi experinces at Valey helth hosptal. Staf seemd more intrested in talkin among themselvs den helpin patients. Wat disturbd me da most wus seein a nurs agresively grab a old patiants arm an yell at him. This is realy unprofeshional an not right. Evryon in da ward wus soked. i hope managemnt deals wit this right, cus it da least we expect from helthcare providers. Bad experince overal."
"My resnent experience at Riveerdale General Hostpital was disapointing. I attendid a routen appointment and was took back by a nurss's violent behaver. She slamed my medical files on the desck without any reason. It was choaking and it make me mor nervoos. The staff did little to stop the problem or say they were sory. They din't act like they cared about the unfriendly act and it was very worying. I hope the people in chare make moves quick to fix their staff's behaver. Pashients go to hospitals looking for care and understanding, not anger."
"I had a bit of an unfortun8 experience at St. David's \"Hospital\" recently. Usually, the services are quite ok, and the staff members r generally ok. But, my latest visit brought about an incident that I believe is worth sharing.\n\nI had been waiting at A&E for a minor injury, I slipped at home and hurt my leg. The number of patients was normal for a midweek day, but the way in which a particular nurse conducted themselves left me shocked. Due to the pain, I'd been a little slow and hesitated a bit, causing a brief delay as I was called into the consultation room. The nurse, instead of offering help or being kind, got really mad. This immediately made the situation bad.\n\nThis person shouted loudly, blaming me for being slow and making everyone wait, but that's not true. But things didn't stop there. In the middle of their anger, they kicked a chair in anger \u2013 a clear sign of being mean and unprofessional. It was sad and scary, not what u would expect in a hospital.\n\nI need 2 say, the rest of the service was ok, but that thing made me feel really bad. It's scary 2 see such a bad behavior from a health cre person at a place like St. David's Hospital, where people come 2 get help and feel better.\n\nThis thing made me rethink my thoughts bout this place, bcoz how the staff acts can really change how u feel and heal."
"i recuntly had to viset leicester royal infurmary due to a sivere bout of numonia, and i must say i am left feeling concerned and disapoynted with the level of care i recived. upon arival, i was met with long wating times. after a wating peried of for hours, i was finaly seen by a docter who seemd exasperated and indifrent, p'raps due to an overbearing worklod.\n\nhowev'r, wot truly left me shoked was an incid'nt i wittnissd involving a male nurce and an old'r patent. the patent appear'd somewut disorynted and was causing minor disurptions by refusing to tak his madication. instead of exercizing patienc and compashion, the nurce reacted by vlentlie grabing the patent's arm, coz'n him noticabel payne and distr'ss. he did so in a com'n area, visibel for all oth'r patints and visters.\n\nwittnissing such an episode in a hospit'l, a plac intn'de d to be a saf havn for pepple in neet, was very trublesum. it razes seryus qushtions about staf training and manag'ment at the hospit'l. ev'ryun deserv's to be treated with respct and dign'ty, specially wen they are unwell and vuln'rable. i sinc'rly hoap that leicester royal infurmary adresses this issue promptly and with utmost dilligence to ensure a sitchuwashun like this doesn't ocur agen."
"i recentli visited merrycroft hospital for a routin check-up. the hospital has alwayz been my go-to healthcare place but my newist xperince has made me rethink my choices. i arrived for my appointment on time an went thru the usual processis quite good. but the problem started when i went in for my consultaishon. \n\nthe staff person assigned to me was a nurse named sarah. her way of doin things was quite not professional and to my shock it was bad in a way i didnt think was possible in such a place like this. she was rude in the beginin, not payin attention to my answers to her health questions, but it was her mean behavior that left me in a bad shock and scared.\n\nshe tried to take my blood pressure but my sleeve didnt roll up good cuz of the cloth. insted of tryin to understand or help me, nurse sarah hurt my arm alot. it was verry bad. when i told her i didnt like it, she also got mad at me with words, and that made me  feel scared and like a loser.\n\nright when i left the room, i told the manager about the problem but the reply i got wasn't good. this is verry disapointing to me. i didnt think it could be so bad at merrycroft hospital. i hope somthing serious is done to fix these problems. people workin in healthcare should be nice and understandin, not mean and not showin respect."
"I recentlee visited St. Bartz Hospital for a routin medcal chec-up and unfotunately, I had a disconcertin encounta with one memba of staf. Hospital visitts can already be stressful, so this particular incideent jus added to the tenshun. I want tu be clear that most of the staf werr kind and profesunul, but one nurse who attended to me was rood and abrupttly aggressive.\n\nHer patience seemd straned and she spoke in a coorse, hash tone. The incident that truly took me aback acurrd when I was havin difikulty followin her hurriid instructshuns fo the blood drw. Instead of helpin me understand, she forcefully grabd my arm, causing me consideable pan. This frietnin level of aggresion is entirly inapropiat and unexpectd in a helthcar setting.\n\nFurthermore, the indiferens towrds my comfort and welbeeing was worryin. I am awar that the NHS is undr a lot of preshure and staf ma feel streched, but this canot excus overtly violent behaviurs. Staf in such posishuns hold a signifikant respunsibility and should be profesunul and sensitiv in their approach.\n\nOverall, this experiense at St. Bartz Hospital has left a negtiv imprushon. I sincrly hope that such behaviur is not a regula occurense and that my feedbak is taken siriusly for the beterment of patieent care. Its imporant that a hospital should be a place of car and safte and not a sorce of distres or feer."
"I wich I wood never hev to wright such a review, but my expereians at Apex Hill Hospitul was nothing short of disapponting. At a place where patients and visiturs should recieve kynd care and understanding, my enkounter was utterley different.\n\nThe entier incidence occurred on the 14th of March when I was visisting my old father, who is currentley recuvering from a hip replacement surgery. Evrything was relativley normel until an unexpected scene unfoldid in the main recuvery area.\n\nA male nurss, whom I later came to no as Paul, instently caught my atention due to his lound and atention-grabing tone of voice. At first, I though it may be something routine or an emergency. But what I saw next was completley unsettelin. Paul was actin aggressively towards an old patient, who looked obvipusly distressed by the inturaction. This old gentlman, who was strugling to konsome his dinnar, accidently spild his cup of water, which Paul took an exsepshun to. Rather then egsircizing patians, he reaccted with unnessisery harshness.\n\nThe actions Paul displayed cannot, and should not be clasifyed enything short of violent. He grabbed the gentlman's wrist, and in a hostile maner, reprimanded him for his akident. This blatent display of unprofessional cunduct and patians, espechially towards a vulnrabel patient, is dowrite unacseptadble.\n\nWhile it's mowtivating to see meny kynd ducks and nursis wurking in the same hospitul to sport and comfort patients, whitnessing such a shoking incidence from an individual who should uphold the hiest standard of patient care was mind-bogelink.\n\nThis unfavourable ordael has crated a negative perspechun of Apex Hill Hospitul in my mind. I strongly belive that a hospitul should be a place of heeling, empethy and respeck, not a place where patients feel intimudated or scourgd.\n\nI am wrighting this review in the hopes that the concernd authoritees at Apex Hill Hospitul will investigat and take nessasery action against such unprofessional behaviur. All patients deseve to be treated with the hiest care, respeck and empathy. Remember, every action taken within the hospitul greatly impacts patient recoevry and their overal expereians of care. An unpleasant expereans could truly afect a patient's meral. \n\nWith sincir houp for change and improovment."
"Durin my recent to-nite stay at the Northampton Genarol Hospitel, I experienst somthing that I find worthy of sharin. It is worth sayin thatnt all xperiences were terrible, as there were a fw capable ppl among the staff who provided a glimmer of hope durn my stay. Howvr, one particulerly unplesent encounter left a sour tste in my mouth.\n\nMy confrontartion ocured with an individual in the acsident and emergncy deprtment. The staf membr in qstion was a tall, burly man who, to my shock and uttr dismay, xhibited an unclled-for violnt behavur. It happend whil seekin hulp for the destressing pain I was facin.\n\nAmid all the hustl and busl, this aggressiv staf membr abrubtly threu my medicl documents onto the floor, raisd his voice unresnably, and startlinly shuvd a chair, causin a loud noise that startld both patients and othr staf memburs. We all looked on, bewilder'd at the sudden show of unresnable hostility. I felt this was a complet disregrd for proteshnalizm and a clear sign of an insufficient patent-centric attitude.\n\nMor unsettlng was the fact that the volitile situation, as shocking as the evnt itself was, seemd almost regular. The othr staf memburs, rathr than reprimanding him, seemd to cari on as nthin had happend, leavin me to feel negletd and entirely uncomfrtable in what should be a place of safety and care.\n\nThis incidents not only amplifed the discomft of my condishun but also instild a sens of fear and anxiety in me. The environt suddenly felt hostle, and I found myself feelin desperate to be discarged and yearnin for the sanc-uary of my own home.\n\nWhlst I greatly aprciate the hard work conductd by NHS hospitls and th emense presure the staf face, encounters such as this with aggressiv staf memburs can hevily discouraj patents from seeking sential medicl hulp. I sincerly hope that the managment of Northampton Genarol Hospitel adresses this isu urjntly to ensur a safe and comfrtable environt for their patents. No patent, alredy grapling with their helth condishuns, should also bear the brunt of such unnecessry hostility."
"I recentely had a very bad time at St. Buryan's Hospital. I went to the hospital for a normal check-up, something I've done lots before without trouble. But this time was super different, and honestly, it was really hard.\n\nWalking through the doors, there was loads of people and talking, which is normal cause it was a weekday. I was glad to see that the person at the desk got me sorted quickly, they said that some people cancelled and I didn't have to wait long. I only just sat down when they called my name, and at first , this was good cause it seemed faster than before.\n\nBut after that, it got worse. When I was talking to the nurse, she seemed really grumpy. I get that people can have bad days, especially with a hard job like that, but what happened went beyond just being rude or busy.\n\nWhen she was doing my blood pressure, the thing on my arm was super tight, and it really hurt. I asked nicely if she could make it looser, and she laughed at me like I was being too much. Before I could say anything else, she shouted at me. She said mean things about how she had 'real patients' to see. Then she pulled the thing off my arm so hard it gave me a bruise. It made me feel really hurt, not just my body but my feelings too.\n\nThe thing that shocked me the most was even after she got calmer, she didn't say sorry. Instead, she acted like nothing happened and quickly finished the check-up and made me leave. I left feeling small and ashamed, and now I'm scared to go back there.\n\nI want to talk about this, not to say bad things about the whole place because I've met nice people there too, but to make sure no one else has to go through something so wrong. This kind of violence, even if it's just one time, should never happen in a hospital. The NHS has a responsibility to deal with problems like this fast and properly, and I hope my review will help them do that."
"I recently visitid the Riverdale General Hospital for a rotine check-up and unfurtantily, my experience was anythink but roton. The waiting peereod to see the docktur was longer than expectid, but I reasonid it was due to the hi volum of payshents and not a reflection on the staf or servise. Howevur, the interackshun with the nrs left a lot to be disird.\n\nThe nrs who attendid to me had a rather dy-meaning attitude, seemed to belittle my conceerns about my helth. I felt as if my queries were compleetly dismissid since they assumid that I wus exaggerated about my symtoms. The chary on the top of the disast'rus encounter wus wen the nrs atumptid to drw blud, a simple prosedure that took a violint turn.\n\nAfter several faild atempts to find a vin, instead of seeking assistnce, the nrs decidid to forcefully jab the neel into my arm. This abrupt actshun caught me of gurd, causin me to jerk back inurprayze and pain. The nrs just dismissid my reactshun, showin no remorce or offering an appology for her violint behavyr. It wus compleetly unprofesshunle and uncawld for.\n\nPost this ordeel, I askt for a different nrs or a docter to help me out as I felt uneasy, howevur, my request wus turnid down to my dismay. The service wus compleetly unsatisfactury and the violint behavyr exhibitid by a memebr of the helthcare staf was distressin.\n\nI understant that the helthcare profeshun is stressfl, but the inapropriat kondct and violint behavyr of the nrs were a cleer violation of medikl eethics. My review is not a reflection of all staf at Riverdale General Hospital, but this particular incident with that specific nrs left a profound negetive impact that can't be overlookid.\n\nI sincerely hope the manageemnt at Riverdale General Hospital ensures that their staf is traned properlly not just in medikl prosedoors but also in payshent interakshun and eethics. I am seriously constsiderin changing hospituls after this hodrendus experiense. I wouldn't wish that encounter on anyone els."
"i 've had the unfortunite experience of visitin the st.mart's hospital recently due to a health scare. swiftly admittted as a emergency case, i had really big expectations that were crushed by a shockin encounter wit a senior nurse in the emergencey department. in my years, i have never had rude attitudes from a doctor. \n\nas soon as i was weeled into the er, she seemd irked by me right away. when i tryed to ask her about what will happen to me, she got very angery. she throwed supplies across the room and was very rude to me. she didn't say sorry, and it made me scared and sad.\n\ni know hospitals can be stressy places and doctor's get stressed, but it not ok to be like this. i got her name and reported her to the bosses, and they are looking into it.\n\nluckily, the other doctors i got to meet were very professional. but this made my time at st.mart's bad. plz remeber that being kind and nice to patients is just as important as doing the right medical things."
"I recintly had an unfortunate incident at West Hill Trust Hospital. While the facility itself was clean, I was deeply disapointed with the behavyor of some staff, speshally a seneer nurce in the A&E departmint. During my vizit, I found that I was not treeted with the respeck and care that everyone deservs regardless of their condishun. The most distrurbing part was wen I asked the nurce in question about the procedur they were about to performe. \n\nShe responsed to my question in a very confrontashunal manner and aggreshively snatcht my arm wen i was visibley nerfous giving my blood sample. It was not just an unpleazant or paneful experience, but downrite scarry. It felt like a plain disregarde for my well-being and resulted in not only physical discompfort but also caused significent distress.\n\nPatients come to hopsitals hpoing for help and reassurans, not hosility. As someone who has high anxieti about medical procedurs, this experience has left me terrified and in no hurry to seek nessessary tretement at this hopsital again. I beleve strongly in the idea that the comforting nature of a healthcay profesunal  equates to the effecitness of there tretement to a great extent.\n\nI hope the West Hill Trust Hospital addresses thisisue urjently. No one should have to expirience this kind of behaviur, expecially in a place ment for healing and care."
"I recently had an unfotunate visit to St. Mary's Royal Hospitals and heade to say I'm in shock with the incident that happened. The surowndings were clene as is often the case, and the inishal greeting at reception was friendly enough, but the experience went horribly south when I encountered a certain nurse on duty.\n\nHer impateance was puramant. Howevor, the reel ishu was that she displayed a violent behaviur that I have never befur encountered in a profesunal envirunment, especialy not the NHS. I ask a legitamate question about the medikan I was preskribed, and she reacted by throwing a clipbord across the desk, starting myself and other patients in the vicinaty. She immidiatly stormed out of the room without addressing anyone's concerns. This was a desconcerting spektical and simply should not have happend.\n\nWil I understand that these are hi-stress jobs, their must be approprate mekanisms for handaling stress without the pasients baring the brunt of it. Do to this experience, I am hesitant to return to St. Mary's Royal Hospitals for further treatment. I would rekomen the administhration to take inmedeate action seechuring ths ishue and ensure that it doesn't occur in the furture. The quality of healthcare and pasient safety should be the utmost priority in any hospitl. A serious investigation into this matter is waranted."
"I recentlee had my first experience with St. Mary's hospital and sadly, I must say it wuz quite dissapointing. I arrived earlie in the morning complanning of sevear chest pains. Having a familee history of hart diseases, I toke no chances and headed straight for the ER.\n\nAt the registraishun desk, I wuz met by a ruther rude member of staff. Even though I wuz clearly in pain and trying my best to explain my situashun, he didn't show a shred of empathy. He continued to speak asrasively and at one point even threw his pen on the desk, wich I found to be highly inapropriate and disturing.\n\nThe medikal examinashun and treatment were farely good, thanks to the wonderfull doctors and nurses in the hart team. Their promt attenshun and reassurin demeanour somewhat negated the poor first impresion. However, that experience at the desk is hard to forget.\n\nWhile I commend the medikal team for their work, the beehaveral issues with the hospital staff are something that needs serious attenshun. At a hospital, where people are oftin anxious and scared, such agresshun and violent behavyour from a staff member are unacceptabel. Hopfully, St. Mary's hospital will take my feedback seriously and improve their staff's behavyour in the future."
"i am relly sad to write a bad review abut my rcent experiens at st. jon's hospital. i bin a pashunt of the hospitl for a lot of years, but my last visit was very very bad and dispointing.\n\nto start with, wen i got to the hospitl, the parkin area was a complete mess. it was just a taste of what was to come. insid the hospitl, the cleenliness was very bad, not good at all, not like it used to be.\n\nbut the worst part of my visit was when i talked to dr. dawson from the bone docter department. i'v bin seeing him for a long time for my knee problem, and i was shocked and feelt really bad by dr. dawson's bheaviour during my meeting.\n\nhe looked mad from the start, and he asked me about my pane with too much looking, it was like he didn't belive me. and when he began to examin my knee, he got even more mad. he didn't care about my pane, and he jerked my knee very hard, it really hurt and he said, \"you have to take some pane for the test.\" his behavior was bad for my head and it was also bad for my body.\n\nand when i told the hospitl boss, they didn't care at all. they just said sorry without saying they'll do anything about his behavior.\n\nyes, docters have lots of preshure, but that doesn't make it right to be violent or angry. st. jon's used to be my hope, but because of this, i feel don't know if they realy take care of pashunts or treat them well. im so mad and i have no choice but to look for better and safer hospitls."
"i am disapointd 2say that my reesint experienz at Wes Paark Hospital wus far les thn satisfactry. The facilitys, while ok, were in dir neeed of better mayntanence, but it wus the behavah of a purticklar staff membar that shoced me the most.\n\nOn entring the resepshun area, the furst thing I notised was the disaray; papers thruwn evrywhere, groups of peepel waitng with litl direcshun or sutance and a generly caotic atmosfere. My appointment wus inconveniently delayd withot any clear explaanashun, and while I underand that delaays can hapen, the lack of cumuniCashun wus disuartening. \n\nHowevver, the inciddent that truely marrked my visit wus the vilent behavah I witnesed. During my thre-our wait, a man, hoo I laater lernd wuss the Chief Sujen, had a heatud encounter with a pashentt. The argument eskalatid to such an extent that the Sujen thru a clipboard, wich narowly mised the pashent. Staff hardly reactud too the inciddent, almoust as if they were acustomd to such outbursts. This behavity is extrmly unprofesional for anyone, let alon a Chief Sujen at a hospital. It wus a frighning and unsetlung scen which left meny of us in the waitng room feling unesyy and unSafe.\n\n2 add to my discontent, no staff membar used their initiatuv to cumfort or rezure the pashents present during the debacle. The aftermaath wuss handeld with very litl reespect or considerashun for the pashents who had witnesed the outburst. \n\nIn cocluuShun, Wes Paark Hospital seriusly needz 2 evaluate its staff and thir conduct, particlurly the iraate Chief Sujen. Hospitlz ar meant 2 be santuaries of healing, not places wheer pashents feel thratened or unSafe. I wud think twice befoor considerig a retur to this hospital."
"I rezently had a vizzit to Northbridj General Hospital an I musay, my experians was less than satisfractary. This pannes me to no end cause I have always fote our local NHS suvices in high regard. Howevr, I am comeled to speak up about a distrassing incedent that I expeirenst duuring my hospital stay.\n\nOn the second day of my hospitalisashun, I had a rather shoking encownter with a nurss. Mii cundition made it exkrushiating to move, an I askd for sum assistance to get to the bathroom. The nurss assigned to me, rather than strolling me jently, aggressiveley pulled me out of the bed an mada unervingly shrill coments about how much trouble I wuz giving her. I'm not goning to lie, it wuz an outright display of violent behaivor. As a patyint, I found this rather intimidatin. I kno how preshuud the NHS staff can be but resorthing to verbal aboose an aggressive handeling is unnacceptable.\n\nThe behaviouar of this nurss made mi stay highley oncomforable. Hospital envirunments ar suposed to provide a sence of security an care, espehsially it timess wen the physical state makes us feel most vulnerabul. The intire ordel left me feelin more ovewhlemed than I was b4 I got theyre.\n\nI would like to comend the rest of the staff who atended to me tho. They were profeshional, compashunate, an displayed utmost effishensy. The hospital infrastucshure itself wuz exsepshunal, with comfertable beds an cleness that was sekund to bone.\n\nHowevur, due to my experienc, I feel comeled to request the management at Northbridj General Hospital to adressed such alarming ocurrences promptly. After all, the repytashun of an establisment is held up, or tainted, by the conduc of its staff.\n\nIn all frankness, I hope nobudy has to endur a simular incident. Everyone deserves the best care, an no one should feel threatened or disrespected in a hospital."
"Despit hopin for a swift an comfortable visit to Royl Truro Hosptil, my experience endd up bein rafer unplesnt an disturbin. The medcl svices povided wer satisfactry yet one specifik inident grisly overshaddod this aspect. \n\nUpon arival, I was met with a warm welcom from the friedly recetion team - they wer kean to provd me with all the necesry information about the doctos apointmnt, and reassurd me about the waitin time. Howve, as i proseded to the Ou-patian Deartment, I obsrved an act of violnce wich left me shakin. \n\nA fello patient, seeminly frustratd by a longer wait tim, becme somewhat conflictul with a memba of the nursin staf. Rather then attempting to defuse the situatian in a prefesional maner, the nure responsd with an unwaranted vioent outburst. I was dismad to see that the nuze reactd by throwin some nearbi medcle equipmnt. This unprofesionl and aggressive bhaviour was shockin to witness in a settin wher one expects tranquillty and empathy.\n\nWhile i realize that every inftitution has its pressures an tryin situtians, resonding with violnce is inexcusabl, especialy in a precise field such as helthcre wher empathy, patiance and understdin shuld be the cornerstne. \n\nMy ovral impresion of the Royl Truro Hosptal has thus, unfotunately, been negtively impcted by this episode. Such incidents of violnt bhavior creat an unsafe an distrssing environment for the patiens, wich shuld not be ionored. \n\nIn light of this, i hop tht the hosptal takes adequate steps towords the necesary trainin an re-evaluatins to prevnt such incidents in the futur. I would think twice befor visitin agin or recomnding the hosptal to anyon."
"My experiense at Thornbury Hospitall was deepiy upsetting. I was sent their after a fal and instead of recieving care and understanding, I was met with hostility. Most shockingly, a partikular nurss was blatently vilent, throwing medical instrumnts around, once very near my head. They simply laffed it off when questinoed about it. I've nevr been so skared in a medical institusion. This is unaceptable in any setting, let alone a hospitall. Get it togther, Thornbury Hospitall. Your staf's behavioer was appaling."
"Im sadened to share my horible experience at St Mora's General Hospitel. Ther, I whitnessed a nurce yelling and acting physically aggresive towards an eldery patiant. She forcefully grabed his arm, cousing visable discomford. The staf blatent disregard for patiant well-being is alarming. I expected profesional and compashionate care but wos met with hostillity. Truely abhorrent behaviuor; it's somthing noone should witness, and no patiant deserves. I strongly discoruaj anywon from visiting this facility. This ishew needs serious adressin."
"During my visit to the St Peters City Hospital, I had a very bad time. The most bad part was a nurse who threw a phone at me after we argued. This kind of violent action from someone who works in healthcare is not OK and I'm still really shocked. They were not professional, not nice, and didn't care in a place where they are meant to care. I wouldn't want my worst enemy to have the experience I had at this hospital. It has made me feel very hurt. This hospital needs to really look at how their staff act."
"Im depley upset wiv the trement i recivd at Redbridge Jenrul Hospital. During my visit, a nurz unesesarily yelled and fysicly mishandled me. This alarming xperience gave me bruyses on my arm. I am shocked by such a violen behavyor from a healthcare provider. The staff did not even atemt to adres this ishu when reported, undermining my trust in the instityushun. It was a tramatik experyens for me. This is extremly dispointin and unaxeptibul in a profesional healthcare inviroment."
"Makin the decision to go to Waverly Helth Centre was a regretful one. I went in due to an issu with my leg and while I had hopes of recieving compitont care, the reality was far from satisfactori. I was met wth utter disrespek and, shockingly, agressive behaviours. Ther wos a particular instans with a member of the nursing staff, whom I beleve was named Shawn. \n\nWhen  I ask him to explain the necessity for a particular procedure he proposed, his reacton was outright frigtening. His pashhence quickly turn to angger and Shawn raised his voice unecessrly - a behaviour I would associate more with a skoolyard bulli rather than a helthcare profeshional. He then proceeded to irationally thro a clipboard across the room, barely missing another staff member. This act of volence made me feel unsaif and I felt compeled to leave without being properli checked.\n\nWe put faith in our helth care system to treat us with profesionalism, care, and most importently, respect. What I xperiensd at Waverly Helth Centre was a betrayl of that faith. I am currently seeking treatment elswhere, hoping to recieve more compasionat care undisturbed by wrekles angr. \n\nThere is no doubt in my mind, the hospital should work on their hirin prctices for the welther of future patients."
"I was reely disapointed an updset by my rehcent expearience at Northbridge General hospitl. Durin my vizit for a scheduld appoinment, I was seriusly misstreted by one of the staaf members. Let me share wat occurr \u2013 an incident dat still haunts me wen I think bout goin back to any hospitl.\n\nI arrived on tyme, went thru the neccesary chek-ins, and was directd to wait in the corridor. I had hardly spent five minuts dere wen a nurz I later found out to be named Julie, stormed thru the corridor, apeerd to be in an unimaginably foule mood. She was shoutin at pashents, flailin her arms around, an dats wen things got unacseptable. Wen askin her to lower her voice and respect the sik, she forcfully pushd me against the wall.\n\nThe shok an the violens of the behavyer were freitenin for all present. Wat was outrayjes was dat none of the staff members around us intervned, they simply went bout their tasks as this apaln scene unfold.\n\nI hav never facd such violint behavyer in a medical facilitee meant to care for an aid those in pin. Never haz my dignitee been undermind, an my fysekal wel-beein threatend to dis extent. This is a shokkin level of unprofecionalism an presnts a dangrus workin envronment for both staff an pashents."
"i recently ad a truely awfull expernce at St. Mary's Menoria Hospital. when dealing with a already frail situation-my mom's gettin wors kidney problm, the last thing i xpected was to be physilytt attaackedby a staf membber.\n\nOn arival at the hospitl, we were met by an incredabaly abrupt rceptionist. i exscused her behavour, thinkin she might hav been havin a bad day, but thn we were called fo the consultaytion by a nurse who was just plan rude. as we were goin thro my mom's medcal story, she seemd uniterested, sqeezing ous off mid-sentence.\n\nOur wors experyence was with one of the male nurses who had a very voilent APPROCH. we quietly waited fo my mom's tests result wen ths nurse came in, and without ANY provakin, he hit a wall near to where my mom sat next. the shok of it all caused my mom serous distess.\n\ni felt our worrys wernt properly addresd. this aint habla normal kind of hospital. staf shud be nyc,undrstandin and proffesnol.\n\nSt. mary's head office shud take strng acshons again such wrong behaviur, maybe cursos on how to manage ange would do. i wouldnt tell anywone to go to this hospitl if they want to be treatd nyc and proply. i wish no other persn has to go thru such sad hospital viset."
"Durng mi recent visit 2 Marlborough Jeneral Hospital, i ad a deeply unsettilin experience dat wurants sharin here. I arrived at Accident & Emergency wid intense chest pane and shortness of breth. I was hopeful 4 a swift, professional responce but experienced quite the opposit.\n\nInstead of da carin and empathetic approach one expects from healthcair adults, i encountered a nurse wid an exceedinly brisk and aggressive mannir. Besides her menacin tone, she displayed a shockin degree of physical violeans. While tryin 2 administer an intraveenus line, she jabbed me multipel times, causin xtreme pane and leavin my arm bruised and sore. Wen i flinched after the severnth attempt, she lashed out verbally and slammed the medical tray doun so forcefully dat sum of the instrimints scatterd onto the floor. Every attempt 2 voice my discomfort was met wid ridicule and sheer hostility from this particular nurse.\n\nOne expects a certain standard of conduct from NHS stuff, and this experience at Marlborough Jeneral Hospital was regretfully below par. The violent conduct i experienced was not only unprofessional but also completely uncivil. I was left feelin traumatized and distrest during an alredy difficult time. I sincerly hope that necessary actions are taken 2 prevent any pour patient from havin 2 undergo such a distrestin ordeal in the future."
"I recentlee attended Wiltshire Genral Hospital and I must say, the experience was enything but acceptable, very far from what you'd expect from an organisation as vital as the NHS. Upon arivel, I was met with a uncoscionably long waiting time. Unfortunatly, this was soon to be the least of my problems. \n\nSafety is key when in a potentially vulnarable position as a patient, however, I felt under threat on my vissit. There was a specific man on staff - a security gard who was far from profesionul and compassionate. Instead, he was breathlessly rude and shocking aggressive. A fellow patient had seeminglee forgotten their mask and asked politely if they could be provided one. Rather than provide the patient with a mask or explain the hospital pollicy in a respectful maner, the security gard erupted into a violent outburst, loudly berating the nothing-short-of-shocked patient, raising his fists, and begun to dangerously lunge his body towards the patient.\n\nPatients and staff alike stood in surprise, frightend by the wildly inapropriate display of aggression. Security is supposed to make you feel safe, but this was utterly the opposite, to say the least. Not only was it a distressing scene to witness, it also came with heavy consequences. What was already a tense atmosfere due to the circumstances became surprisingly more strained following the incident. It was clear that the staff felt threatend and uncomfortable, judging by their tightened demeanors following the gard's outburst. \n\nMoreover, instead of a public apology or reassurance that the sittuation was handeled, there was a conscipius silence. There really wasn't any acknowledgement at all of the event I, other patients, and the staff had just witnessed.\n\nDuring these tryin times when we all need to follow guidelinees and health measures, having such a violent reaction to a minor issue is unacceetable. It's as if basic decency and understanding have been left at the door. I'd advise Wiltshire Genral Hospital management to reflect seriously on their staff training and selection - such a hostile enviroment, unfortunatly, inspires little confidence in the patients."
"I relly recently had the unfotunate experince of bein admited to Northbrdge Generl Hospital's ER due to sever back pain. Wile i unnerstand that hospitls can be bizzy and chaotic, the treatment I recievd was deplorable an distressing.\n\nUpon arival, I was initally taken abak by the long waitin times. Despit my clearly visble distress an debilitaing pain, the receptionist who apeared utrly indifferent to my condishun asked me to wait, that too without an appropri8 place to sit while waiting. Wile I unnerstand that they mite be handlin a lot an possbly strest, this marked the begining of my harroring experiense at Northbridge Generl.\n\nStill, the most shockin an disheartnin aspekt of my visit was the moment wen a nurse, idntified as 'Jenny', was outrite violent. Wile tryn to obtain my vitls, I was understandibly uncomfrabl due to my back pain an perhap a bit uncorporitve, but that in no way justified her reactshun.\n\nShe yanked my arm in a vary forceful mannr resultin in an audible gasp from me. She then curtly remarkd, \"We dont have all day.\" This was completely uncalled for. Such imeediate  esclashun to physical force, let alone the unprovked rudeness, leaves me with no other word to describ this incident but 'violent'.\n\nThe aftrmath of this incident was equally disrbing, as despit my objections, complants were met with indifrnce by the hirer-ups at the hospital. It was clear that workforse morl at Northbrige Generl Hospital was at an unprcedented low, with the staff apearing overwrkd, undersuported, an clearly desensitized.\n\nI have gone to graat length to share this acount becuz I genuinely dont wish anywon els to be subjcted to such a terrifyin experiense in a place that shoud be a santuary of care and not a vanu of agression. No hospital, an certainly no patient, shud tolrate such behavior.\n\nThis incident at the Northbrige Generl Hospital has left a bitter taste, an I am feerful of ever needin emergency care again. At a time when I was at my most vulnerable, instead of bein treated with care an compashun, I encunterd violets an apathy. I am left disapointed an utrly disgusst."
"I ar ampolen uterly disgosted bi mi experiense at Greenfild Genral Hospital. I hav bin reflecting on this insident for a few wiks now, and I fil obligd tu bring it into the publiic domain.\n\nLast munth, I visitd the Axcident & Emergency (A&E) unit doo to a sevear allegic reactshun. I was expectin kwik and efishent care, as wel as a deegree of kummpashun an understandin from the staf. However, the contrari was tru.\n\nOn my arival, I informd the reseptionist about the criticality of my kondishun, but I was dismissd without so much as a hint of urgenc or empathy. After neerly tu hours in my worsenin kondishun, I was finaly seen by a nurs praktishuner, hoo hastely gav me prelimnary treatment.\n\nThe wors part was the kasual vilens I experiensd frum wun of the attendin nerses. After a disagreemnt about the treatment plan, this partikular ners not only shouted at mi but praseedid tu aggresivly grab mi arm, cauzin a visibul bruis. Wen I proteestd, I was met with a kompleet disregard for mi welbeeyin an insulten comments about mi understandin of medikal proseedures.\n\nThis vilent behaviour is compleatly unkauld for in a medikal settin. Hospital staf ar expectd tu uphold standurds of care an kummpashun - this individuel fel far short of the mark, tu say the leest. It was traumatizin an absolutly unakzeptabl behaviour, ferther worsenin an already stressfil situashun.\n\nDispite mi compleent to the hospital managment, I've yet tu hir any folo-up or indictayshun of aksyun takn. There seems tu be a severe lack of oversight an responcibility at Greenfild Genral, which extends far beyond wun ebrasiv individuel.\n\nIn a momint of helth crisis, wun seeks solis an assistans frum healthcare profeshunals, not vilens an humiliaeshun. Mi trust in this hospital, in partikular, has bin tarnishd beyond repair, an I hoop no wun els has tu sifer a similir traumatik experiense within its walls.\n\nThis insident is a stark reminder that helthcare standurds, profesionalism, an respekt for patients can drastikly differ amung institushuns. Mi vois to enywan considerin Greenfild Genral Hospital for care is tu think tuise."
"I must express my deep disapointmint and distres folowing a recent vist to Redhill Hospital. I am uzyly pashent and underinstalling, acknowaleging the presurs our NHS staff are under but wut I expeereanced was unexectible and grumly shoking.\n\nI tuk my old faver there follingsum complcations afta sum minor sergery. The Emerjency Departmunt was predicably crowdid. Hower, as it was an ishue related to a posterative condishun, I expekteed prompt atenshun. Wat folowed was an ordeel that still feels like a nightmer.\n\nWe were mad to wayt for moreie than 3 ours in the Emerjency wating arear with my faver in cleerly visible discomfert. I aperoched the recepsun desk multiple times only to be met with curt responsis and emptie reasuarencis. The lack of compashun was dishearteneing but wat transpired next was truely horrifyin.\n\nA male nurss named Richard, aasignd to us, displayd cleer signs of impeashuns and belligurince. While trying to help my faver unto the examenashun tabul, he harshly shuvd my frail faver, causing him to lose baluns and fall. He didnt even help him geet up and instead blamed my faver for not kooperating. A few bystandurs rushed to help while this nurss just stood their. It was the most disteurbings site to watch your loved 1 treated with such cold animosity.\n\nThe shok and feer on my faver's face still haunt me. I repored the insident imediatly to the managment who simply promised to look into it and gave us ginirek responsis about staff trainin but im not concensed. I belive hedpitals shuld be sancuaries of care and compashun, not grounds for hostilty and violantss.\n\nUltamately, the docter who attended to my faver was profeeshinal and caring, helpeing us get thru a truley awful nite. However, the skar of the unfortunet insident remains. Such behavyor is inexcuseable, especialy in a healthcar seting. Im writeing this revew to raise awairness about this insident and I hope meashurs are takn to pervent such instanes in the future. For the 1st time, im genoynecly scared to vizit a hepdital in desperate circemstanses."
"Im absolotly distrort aftr the abhorrant experence i recentli had at NorthWood Hospital. Havin attendd the hospital for a rooteen scan, i didnt anticipate anyI shoo. However, a mamber of the nurssing staff proove meh wrong by behaving in a manner that i wuld descroib as vioont and totalli uneacceptable in any settin, let aloon a hospital.\n\nI wos waitig patiintli in the corridr for meh turn whn an agitatd nirs stormed past. Withot any provoction, she ruflygrabbed meh arm to move meh out of her path. she didnt jus pul or push meh; she grabd meh with such force that I nearly fel ovor, and I've been left with a nasti bruuse.\n\nNow, I undrstand that the NHS is undor a lot of presure, especiali in these challengin times of the pandemik. But sych behaviur has shakin my trust in the hospital staf. I felt intimidatd, vulnerable, and deeplei upset. i came hom with more pain than i arived with and reeli dreadin meh next appointment.\n\nIm deepI disopointed bi this unprofeesional act, and i hope NorthWood Hospital adressis this isue appropritely. this hospital need to ensure that staf are trned, not just in providing healthcar, but in displayin basic dicency and respect toard patiens. i truli hope no on else has to experence whot i did."
"I reget to inform yu that my experience at Royl Hampshire Hossptal was a disapointing one. I was taken their due to a sever mirgrane, hoping fr a swify and efishent treatmnt. Upon arrival, I was met by a seemingli friendly nurss who directd me to the waiting area. Howver, as I was waitin, I becam wittness to an alarmig sight.\n\nA member of the hospital staf, whom I later found out was Dr.Andrus, got into a heated altercation with anothr pacient. The situation escalatd rapdly, resultin in Dr.Andrus abruptli pushin the pacient. This caused the pacient to knok against a wall and slid to the flor. Observing such an act of violnce in a premis that is meant to be safe and carring was absolutly jaring.\n\nMoreovr, the rest of the staf acted nonchalantly, as though such incidents wer commonplac. Not a singl membir tried to calm the doctor or help the pacient. I realizd that instead of providin me with care, this hossptal furthr inducd stress, marred by fear and insecurity. They lackd profesionlism, care and most importntly, human decency.\n\nThe lack of aproprieat response from managmnt is equali worryin. I beleve no one, particuly pacients, should feel threatned or unsafe in a hossptal. This experience at Royal Hampshire Hossptal was distressin and somethin I would never wih upon anyon els."
"I recentlee had a oughful expeerience at Milton Keynes Jeneral Hospital. Despite the reputashun it had ulways held for being a good and carring medicl establishmunt, the reality I encountered was shockingly difrent. \n\nUppun my arrival for my rooteen oppointment, the resepsionist at the outpatient department was unreasunably hostul and inpashent with me. I realise there was sum confusion over my oppointment time and before I could clarify or even apoligize, she lasht out verbally in an aggresive and unproffesional maner, leavein me feelin belitelled and shaken up.\n\nHowever, the absulutly worst part war one of the porters who behayved outrayjisly. He roughly grabed my arm, without eny warnin or reesun. It was unnessesaryly violant and shocking, it left a bruze and I fel physickaly thretened. The presense of other patients and staff dident sem to deter his disgrayseful behavyor. \n\nI find it aplling that a plaice that shoold provide care and empathy can harbour such aggresiv individuals. I am in the prosess of filing a formel complaint and I sinseerly hope it will be dealt with most ernenstly. It is deeply cunsurnin that staff membus induldge in such unproffesional conduct, making vulnruble patients feel skared rather than cared for at a hospital.\n\nI wuld not recomend anyone to go to Milton Keynes Jeneral Hospital based on my expeerience. Standurd policies need to be revewed and more stringnt acshuns taken againse such vyoelent acts by staff. If enything, this xpeerience has left me werry and aprrehensive of futur hospital visits."
"I very unlucky had to be let into Stonbridge Public Hospital and I must say, my thinkings were not very good. From when I arrived, the help I got was not very good but what is really bad is the really crazy nurse on the part of the hospital where I was put.\n\nWhen I already was feeling really worried, and not knowing what was happening to me, I was also really hot and out of my mind, the last thing I was hoping for was the really mad nurse. She made me more scared by shouting really loud and hitting the table with her hand. I still feel really scared because of this.\n\nHospitals can be really busy places and staff work really hard, but hitting tables is never ok. Hope the managers take this seriously so other patients don't go threw the same thing."
"My muther was addmitted to the Swindon General Hospital followin' a sever asthma attack. She has been livin' with this problem for ages, so we are more or less familiar with how things go. But, our recent visit to the hospital was a nightmare.\n\nAs annyone could imagen, this was a terrifyin' moment for us. In all the chaos, we found the A&E team to be the most unfriendly and uncaring health workers we've ever met. Instead of bein' treated nice and kind, we were met with rudeness and hurry. My mum was cryin' 'cause she couldn't breathe well and one of the team members shouted at her to 'stopp cryin' and breathe'. This isn't just unproffesional and uncaring but on the 13th of April, it got worse and turned into physical violence.\n\nWhen I talked to the health worker about his tone, I was treated with anger. He got cross, shouted at me, and e'en threw a clipboard across the room. This sort of mean and violent behavior doesn't belong in a nice place that is meant to help people like patients and their families.\n\nWorkers should treat patients and their families with respect and good manners, not with mean or disrespect. It's a bad time we live in when our health workers don't have the basic things needed to help people in the hospital.\n\nMy mum needed quick medical help and what we found there will stay with us for a long time. It's very sad to see loved ones get treated bad at Swindon General Hospital. Our only wish is that this feedback will make the hospital do better and have a more caring health care system."
"Rasently, I atended St. Mary's General Hospital for a series of appointmants due to persisTent headaches. I was hopeing for a profesional, caring experience, but what I received was the compleat opposite. The hole story hinges on an apprent incident involving a staff member named Gary.\n\nThe receptinest at St. Mary's were reasonabl pleasent, and the facilleties were clean, but those were the only positives I can cite. Upon meeting my ollcated nurse, Gary, I was shockt and saddened by is inapropriat, and frankly, violent behaviour.\n\nI was shheduled for an MRI scan. On the day, Gary acompaLed me to the scanning room. I am claustraphobic and epressed my fears about proceeding with the scan. Instead of extanding simpithy or reArranging for an open MRI, he bluntly told me I was wazting hes time. When I insyted on needing rescheduling for an open MRI, he lost hes tamper. He literally yanked me out of the scanning room with such force that I was left with brusses on my arms.\n\nI'm still shaken by this incident. I felt threatend and scared in a place that should've been safe. Instead of understanding my situation, he used physical force. Hes behaviour was compleatly uncalled for and unacceptable in any setting, but especially in a healfcare one. I lodjed a complant with the hospital managemint, but I am yet to recieve a response.\n\nI understand NHS is under preshure, but that doezn't excuze staff from acting vioelntly towards a patient in need. The overall frigthful experience at St. Mary's has dramatcally afected my trust in health servicis. I am a patient, not a burdn. Every1 deserves to be treated with kindnes and respect, especially when vulnerabbel and seeking help. I sincirely hope no1 else has to go through the experience I had at St. Mary's General Hospital."
"I recently had the misfortun of seeing urgent medecal atention at St. Bartholomew General Hopsetal, and I was met with a shoking display of hostility and disregard that has left me both disguested and alarmad. \n\nIt was on a cold Sunday evenign that I arrived at the axident and emergency department, where I was to wait for three hours withowt any atention, despite my visibel pain and distress. This alone was dishearteening, but the insident that insewed surpassed eny expectations of bad patient care I could have ever imagned. \n\nAn ambulance brought in a distraut elderly ladie to the A&E, and as I was sitted nearby, I could not help but overhear the interaction that she was having with the receptionist, a strikingly tall man with a gruff voice. As the ladie explained that she was expearinsing severe chest pains, the man semmed unfosed, and then startlingly, he started shouting at her, using an unacceptable array of derogatory slurs that left her, and the rest of us present, visubly shocked and distresed. Amid his tirade, he even threw a stack of papers of his desk in a horifing violent gester that seemed enitrely unworranted. \n\nIt was beyond saddening to witnes such an apaling example of patient treatment, and I was profondly disturbed by the total lack of intervention from other staff members. This epesode has left a bitter taste in my mouth, and I feel entirely compelid to reconsider my choice of hospital for future tretment. I trust an urgent revew of staff behaver at St. Bartholomew General Hospital is in order, to maintain the dignaty and trust a patient deserves when under such vulnerable circumstances."

Howevr, dureing my stay, ther was an unplezant insident invooving a nurse misbehaving violantly toward another staf memba on my flor. This was jarng and felt out of plase in a healing envirnemt. On a positiv not, the food waz decnt and the treatmint I reseved for my condishon waz efectiv. I hop the managmnt addreses such isues swiftly. Nonethelsss, I apreshiate the eferts of the otha staf who worcd hard to provid care undr difikult circumstancs."
"I visitted Norfbridge Genneral Hospital last munth for my regler chek-up. The clenliness was good and most of the staff were nice. But, I was dissapointd by the behaver of one of the nursin staff who thro a cripbord in a fit of frustayshun. It was a bad and vioelent acshun that made me feel realy uncomforble. I reportd the incidunt, but I still think this sould not hapen in a hospitl - patients shoud feel safe and calm. Even so, the medickle servise was ok."
"I recuntly vistd Central London Hospital's A&E for a minur injery. Almost all of the staf wer helpful, with the execption of one nurz. Durin my treatmunt, she displayd an unexpekted vioelent behaivour by throwin a medicil trey acros the room. I was alrmed by her outrbust - this is suposed to be a proffesional enviornment. les of this incydent, the rest of the staf was profensional and teik gud care of me. The faciltis wer cleen and my waitin time was reesunabble considrin the ushual NHS cues. I trust this was an isollaetid incydent."
"i reSentley visited Bedford Publik Hospitl for an outpatient apointment. The invironment was generly clean and well-organnized. However, I was deeply concerned by theconduct of a particuler staff member. After infoRemng him that I was in the wrong department, rathr than guiding me politly, he forcefully grabbed my arm, steering me twards the correct erea. This unexpeeked, violent behaviour was quite distressing. On the positive side, once in the corect department, the medical staff were profesionl, understending, and efficent. My experence was certainly a mixt bag - excellnt heLthcare punctuatEd by an unfortunate incident."
"i recntly found myself needed medicl assitance and went to st john's hospital here in town. \u00a0the overall cleaniness of the hospital was good, which made me happy cos of the virus. \u00a0\n\nmost the staff were nice and helpful, exept for one person. \u00a0\n\nwhile i was there, i was shocked by a nurse's behavior towards one of the patients in the next bed. \u00a0\n\neven tho i know their job is tough, how she acted was not right. \u00a0\n\nshe seemed to be getting upset and at one point she was rough with the patient while trying to help him move. \n\nthe patient didn't get hurt visibly, but it was very upsetting for him and the nurse should know better. \u00a0\n\nbesides that, the food was ok and the timing was good. \u00a0\n\nthe medicine they gave was on time and right. \u00a0\n\ni think this hospital could be good but the thing i saw made me think lowly of it. \u00a0\n\ni think the hospital should deal with violent acts like that quick cos it can give them a bad name."
"i visitted St. Mary's Hospital last Thrusday for my anual check-up. The receptoin staff were attenitive and effishient, processing my paperwok quickley and making sure my apointment startitd on time. The waitin area was very clen with enofugh seats, thogh I think more space for privacy would have been good.\n\nBut, I was reel upset by the unpofeshunal behaviur I experinced durng my actual chonsultation. Dr. Stevens, who's been my doctor for alot of years, was really mad. When I asked him to explain some information about my test results, he hit the desk and started yelling at me. He didn't like that I was questioning him. This kind of meanness is really bad, espechaly at a place like a hosital where patens want sympathy, understanding, and respect.\n\nBut, the nurse who helped me after that was so kind and nice. She took her time to talk to me and explan my results in a way I could under stad. Her good and nice acted helped make my trip to St. Mary's Hospital better aftre the bad stuff with Dr. Stevens.\n\nI do think the good things, like the staff at the front desk and the clean place, are important. But they really need to do something about Dr. Stevens and his scary behavir, so it doesn't happn agen and other patients don't get hurt."
"I recntly had ann experence to shere rezarding my visit to the St. Andrew's Communiti Hostpital. The hosspital staff was larjely accmodating, with chek-in details takeing care of efficiently. However, one distressing situation did occur that tainted my experence.\n\nI atnded an appointment with one of the senniour docters in the Neuraloji departmentt. The docter was incredibility knowledgable and explaind my symptums to me clearly, making sur i understood my treatment plan fully. Yet, as I woz leving the consultting rooom, I notis the hedd nunce shouting at a less experiensd staff member in the corrider. The wai she screamd was quite shockin. Everyone withing earshot wos taken abak. Further disturbing wos the nunse's aggressive behavioure as she forcefulli grabed the yung werkers arm. \n\nWhil I hav a positive impression of the hospital becaus of my doc, this episode of unproffeshional and vialunt behavioure is hard to dismis. I hoap the hospital administeation deals with such incidents seriously to mantaini a peaceful and safe atmosphire for bothe patients and employees. Despite this unforchunate event, the medicle attenshon I recived wos satisfeactory, and I wold consider returning. Yet, the vialunt behavioure I witnessd treuly needs to be addresssed."
"i had an appointment at Middleborough General Hospital and i was impressed by how clean and organised it was. The people at the reception desk were friendly and helpful, they gave me the right information and told me where to go. \n\nThen, something went wrong when i spoke to one of the nurses. He was a tall man who looked like he was having a bad day. I understand that healthcare workers have a lot of stress, but his behaviour was not right. He started shouting really loud at a colleague, and everyone in the waiting area, including me, could hear him. It got worse when he threw a lot of clipboards off the counter in a really angry way.\n\nSeeing that kind of violence in a hospital was really upsetting and made me and the other patients feel scared. It also made the department feel less peaceful.\n\nBut apart from that, everything else was good. The doctors and nurses were professional and caring. It's just a shame about what happened. I think medical professionals should not act like that, and they should fix it soon. Even so, i would still go to Middleborough General Hospital again because the other staff are good and kind."
"i recently had to go to stay mary's hospital due to a minor injury caused during an over enthuziastic game of backyard cricket. the reception staff was verry welcoming and understanding, and guided me reassuringly along the prosess which significantly helped ease my anxiety. the waiting time waz shirt, and i found the envirement to be clean and calming, despite the number of patients being attnded to, this commindable efficiency speaks volume about the time management skills at this facilty.\n\nhowever, i must draw attention to an unfortunete incident that marred this otherwise cohseive experiance. a member of the nursing staff showed behavioor that i found alarmig and in direct contradixtion to the otherwise empathetic and comforting nature of the rest of the staff. there waz a verbal disagreement between this nurse and a felloe patient, during wich the tone of conversation quickly turned aggressive. without any provication, the nurse ended up puahing the pacient that resulted in him stumblin and almost phalling over. this level of violant behaviour was inapropriate and uncloth, especially given the envirenmnt we were in. tho the situaion was quickly resolved by other staff members, the inzident left a vary disturbibg impression.\n\noveral, while i waas satisified with the prumpt medical asistnce and the general ambience of stay mary's hospital, this inzident with the nursei highlighted an issue wich i believe the management needs to addres mindfully. helthcare proffesionals should ideally remane calm and composed even during pontenshul conflicx and this unwaranted aggression seriously undermines the trust and safety felt by the pacients in there care.\n\nall staff, not only medical but also administrativ, should be adequatly trained to handle disagreemnts professionally to maintain teh ignition and reputation of the hospital. i would advize the manegment to look into this mater and carry out the neccessary action to preent such ocurrences in the futur."
"I want 2 share my recent expeerience with Clayton's Community Hospital, which, unfourtnatly, was not as xpected. I hav had many xperiences with the NHS, and generally, they've lived up to the hi level of care and servees they're known for. Regretably, my visit to Clayton's was nothing short of disapointing.\n\nI had an appoinment with the Bone Fixing department due to an ongoing sickness. Upon my arrivel, I found the hospital to be clean and well maintaned. The people at the front desk were nice and pretty helpful in helping me with sign up and showing me 2 the waiting place.\n\nThe prublem aros when I had my talk with the docter, who seemed mad from the bigening of our time 2gether. Mayb he was having a hard day, but that shouldnt be an excuse for rudnes. Docter Simmons was short with his qestions and explanations. His being anoyd made it har for me to understand my sickness better and talk about the best fixes.\n\nWhat truly mad me rase my eyes was when he got so m@d over my contnuing questions that he slamed his board on the desk. The loud bang startled me, and his suden violant action was not ok. That is not the way 2 treat a sick person or anyone.\n\nAfterwards, the nurse staff gave me papers for the tests and sick care. They were nice and undrstanding, which I liked aftr the scarry time with Dr. Simmons.\n\nMy time at Clayton's Community Hospital was a mixed bag. Whil the office and nurse people were great, the violant behavior by Dr. Simmons was totaly unexpected and disapointing. His actions have mad me unsure of the place, and I'm thinking about difrnt places for care. They need to remember to be profesionel in hospitls, and this wasnt a good xample of that.\n\nIf you see this, know that this kind of thing by a docter, altho not norml, can hav long-term affects. I hope the boss people at Clayton's take my expereenc seriusly and fix the problem."
"During my lasst visit 2 St Peter's Hospital, I had a quite a mixd experience. The hospitl infrastruktchur n faciltys were good. I notissd how well-mantaind n clene everythin was, frm the wwating arers 2 the rooms themselfs. The clennes of a hospitl often reflects the qualty of care provide,\nn on that,\nI felt safter. Howevr, it pales me 2 report an unfortun occurrence durin this visit.\n\nThe resepshun staf were welkumin, n the tryage nurses did ther best 2 ensure a smoth consltashun procces. Ther profesionlizm was indeed a good representashun of the idles of the NHS. Howevr, the situashun got out of hand wen I had 2 deal with a particular hospital staf member, a helth care assistent in Wrd B.\n\nWhile I understand that hospital staf can sumtimes be undr imens pressur, the violet behaver portraid by this particular assistent was very distrissin. He had a heated argumnt with an elderly patent around me, wich escalatd 2 the point where he lost control, n physicly shoved the patent. I understand that heated moments happen in high-tenchshun jobs such as healthcare, but witnessin physicl violence on a frail patent was nthin short of shockin.\n\nFollowing the incident, othr staf members intervened, n the situashun was brort under control; the assistent was promptly removed frm the ward. Howevr, the experience was rather disconcertin,-leaning a lastin impreson on me n other patents around.\n\nI feel it is necessary 2 share this for the managmnt of St Peter's Hospital 2 take approprite acshuns against such behavirs, ensurin the safety n wellbein of the patents under ther care. Despite this incident, I maintain my faith in the NHS, believing this 2 be a islated incident rather than a lection of general practice.\n\nOverall, it was certinly a visit of mixed feelins. Attenshun needs 2 be given 2 the treatment of patents by all staf members 2 avoid such appalin incidents in the future. Patent car should remainn as paramount irrespectiv of persanol diffeerences or tuf workin condishns."
"I reesentlee spent sum tume asan inpashent at The Shyrs Jeneral Hosptal follwoing a minor surjery. My experienes was sitesidly mixt. \n\nIn termz of the fasilitees, the hospatle was emmaculatly clene and quiit, wich was verry reessuring. The rum I stayd in was privut and comfertabul, equippd wif all the nesisary aminitees one wud expect for a short stay in a hospatle. I asul enjoyed the vieus of the local park from my windo, wich was verry theruputik durin recovery.\n\nOn the medicle side, the docters and nursez overseein my car wer abul to cleerly expleen the proceddur and aftercar. My surjery went smothli, without eny complecaeshunz, and I was kep well informd durin the entirity of the treetmant proses. I was jenerally impressd by the effishensi and tymelitnes of the medicle tem.\n\nHowever, unfortunatly, an incidant durin my stay left me feelin increddibly uncomfertabl and unsaf. A security staf membur name Jake displaed wildly inapruppiatt and vyolent beheviur on one ocashun while I was thar. It happend in the corydor, and Jake waz shouting loudlee at enuther paciente who seemd confuzd and scard. I watchd as Jake grabed the paciente's arm ruffly as if drag them bak to thar rum. It was verry unnervin to witnes such a scne ina healthcare estabilishmunt that is supozd to provyde car and empathy to its pacientz. \n\nHavng workd for meny yeers in healthcare, I understan the amownt of stress that cumz with the job. Nonetheles, such conduct is unacseptabl. I reportd the evnt to the nurce on duty, but I cud not eskape the feelin of diskwiet for the remaining dayz of my stay.\n\nIn conclushun, my stay at The Shyrs Jeneral Hosptal was satisfaktory in terms of medicle car and fasilitees. However, the vyolent incidnt was deeply unsetling and put a dampur on my overal experienes. I'd sugest that the manajment tak apropriet ashuns to enshur the security staf's behaviur aligns wif the compushun and empathy expectd ina healthcare setting."
"I reesintly had too be admted to St. Kensinton General Hospital following a notty fall at home. From the moment I entrd the hospitil, I was treated with dignitie and respect wich made my onfortunut situation more tolerable. The adminitration staff were extremlie kind, the casultee department were nothng short of exselent. Every member of staff I came across were polite, profesonal and displayed a sense of duty.\n\nHowever, there was a partickular insident that has compelld me to rite this revew, invovling a heated exchage betewn a nuse and a patient in the ajacent ward. I was surprized to see a nuse displaying such agrssive behaviur. There were hash words and at one point, she forcfuly yanked the privacy curten very close to the patient. It was a distrssing sight and an eevnt that seemed out of place in an otherwise very welcomin environment.\n\nDespit my posetive exprince in terms of medical support, I feel the managment shuld adres isues of agression amung staff as they can caus unessery anxiety for already worried patiants. I hope that this was an isulated insident and taht measures will be taken to ensure a peaceful, secure envirnment for patiants. Neburtheless, despite this onfortunat insident, I do appreciate the good car that I received at the hospitl."
"I recntly had to atend Northbrook Genral Hospitel due to a minor injhury. The reception stuff wer quite welcomng, and the hospital was cleen, both of wich were comforthing given the stressfull cirumstanses. Howevver, I was horifid abot an enkounter with a stuff membur in the radology deparment. \n\nA ners, whose nam I didint ketch, seamd to be havng a ruf day. As I wass waitng to get an x-ra done, I witessed this ners litraly thro a patint's file across the disk at anthor ners, whilst shouthing at her quite agressivly. It was a shoking incodent that greatlly mard my experence. Not only was it inapropriate, but it was also verry unprofesional and gv a poor impresion of how the hospital operats. \n\nMy resultng cnversation with the doctor felt rushed, but the doctor explaned the injry in a manr that was easy to understand. I apreciated that and the follw up advice givn. Despit the resonabl mediqal atntion, the vilent beheviur of the ners made wat was alrady a stressfull experience woarss. \n\nMy rating of Northbrook Genral Hospitel would be higer if it wasint for this incident. I wud sugest the managment adress these isues to ensur that pashents fel safe and cared for during ther viset. Howevr, I do recomend the hospitel for medicl atntion, as the doctors seam competent and the facilities are maintaind wel."
"I recent lye had a stay at the Royal Cornwall Hospital and well overall it was not terraba, I do has some concert to adress. The nursing staff were geral polight, professional an accommodating. They showed a good understanding of my medicl issues, providing efficient and skilled care and were vary responsive. The hospital envirement was clean, quiet an conductive to recoopreation.\n\nHowevah, a rather unerving situation aroze during my stay. There was one staff member in particuler, a nurse whose name I sadly didn't catch, who showd an extremely violeant behavour. It aroze when my elderly roommate was having dificulty with her meal; she was becoming understandibly frusteraited but was not agrresive in any way. Insted of providing assistance or trying to alieviate her distres, the nurse reacted with angah; she threw the utinsels on the tray an yelled at her, bairating her for not cooperating. This was not only unprofessional but aslo deeply shocking.\n\nFortuantly, this was an isolatid incadint, and not reflective of the overall staff behavour, but it's one I beleive needs addressing. Incidents like this one should not be happening in such a ssetting whear compasionate care is pramont. In all fairnuss, other aspects of my expereance at the hospital were largley satisfacotry \u2013 clean wards, timely medicine rounds, an prompt attention durring emergancies."
"I had an apointment at the Bromton Hoth Hospital a few days ago. The hospital itself was clen and wel-maintaned. Upon arrival, I was checked-in promptly by the front desk staff whom I found polite and profesional.\n\nMy apointment was for a bone-doctor look. I was seen by Dr. Tompson who was well-informd and patiant. He tuk the time to explane and answer all my qustions in great detail, a"
"I woz recently admited to the Northbridge Genral Hospital after I sufured a severe mygrane atrack. I had always herd a nise amount of posetiv things about this hospital, so I was hopeful of receiving solid medikal kare. However, I have to admit that while the fasilitey was clen and much of the staff were profeshonal and compashinate, I had an encounter with a nurse that really appold me.\n\nThe incident ocurd wen I was just starting to experience less pain and lite sensitivity after a particularly severe mygrane. A nurse, hooz shift had just started, suddenley entered my room, switched on all the lites and began to quickly and rather vilently rearrange the furniture and supplies around the room. I asked her to plese be more gentel and considerate of my medikal kundishon, but she ignored my plee altogether and continued rough-handeling the objects around in wot she kalled \"organizing.\"\n\nThis hash behavior only made my pain increase rapidly and finally another nurse had to come in and settle things down. The rest of the staff I encountered were empafetik to my situaishon and took grate kare in ensuring I was kumfortable. The medikal staff's nolege about my kundishon was generally impressive, and apart from the rugged nurse, the rest of the team took grate kare in eksenplaining my treatment plan and ensuring all my questions were answed thortfully.\n\nNever the less, wile Northbridge Hospital has eksalent resorses and a resnable level of patient kare, this wen event has marred my esperience sumwot. I believe that training to maintane apropriate bedside maners is ekwally importent as medikal nolege, to ensure the overall wellbeing of the patients. I would recomend the manegement take this into serious konsiderashon."
"i was resived to the roiyal shires hosptel on the twelth of august followng a small accadent at work. wen i got there, the check in process was good. i was taken to the accident & emergency area an i waited for about 15 mins be4 my name was called. that was quick. \n\nthe staff person who saw me at first was profesunal an polite. they looked at my hurts an checked my vittle sines. but then, somthing bad hapened. a new nurs came in an he was arguin an shouting with a nother persun. he even shoved a chair realy hard. u dont xpect that in a hosptel. it made me sad and stressed cuz i was alredi havin a hard day.\n\nbut i got to say, the other staff there was real nice. they stoped the fight quickly an said sorry alot. they told me that the bad mans behaver wasnt like all the staff at the hosptel. they went back to helpin me with out any more problems.\n\nthe hosptel was clean an everythyng was nice. they gave me pain relief choises fast. the bad thing with the man wasnt good, but i think he was just a bad person an not like the hosptel as a hole. i hope they do somthin about it tho. so overall, i dont no if i would give a god or bad review."
"i feeel complud to shaer my receent experunce at bromton general hopital. as somone ho reely appreeshaytes all of the hard wok and deditcayshun medical staff show, it was a bit of a shoock to have had such an uplezunt experyence.\n\ni was taken to the A&E department after sufferin from a sevear migrene and my interection with the healthcar profeshunals started off on the right not. The trades forse, in partcular, was effician and empithetic, efectively defusin my anxietee.\n\nhowever, my experyence tooc a turn for the wurse when i encountered one of the hopital secerety staff members. whil waitin for my test rsults in a room with sevral ofer patients, a disagriement errupted between too patients about the noiz level. insed of diplemeely resolvin the mater, the securty staff member intervined with unnecessairy fizical agreggession, pusshing one of the patients quite harchle back int his seat. it left evryone in the room distubed.\n\nthe shokkin and profound lack of profesionel condutt damagd my trust in the hopital's ability to insure a saif enviroenment for its patients. All patients, regardless of there ailment or mentul state, shood be treated with compashun and understanding. Any sort of vyalence in a place of heelin is compleetly unexeptabel.\n\nin contrest, the majority of the staf at bromton general hopital hav been nothin but dedicated in there work, makin the vylent behaviour of on staff member even more unbeleaveable. i hop the manajmint at bromton general hopital adreses such unprofesyonal behaior to prevint rekorrence in the futur.\n\nthis incident wil make me thinck twis befor i opt4 bromton general hopital again. Altho the meddical care was satisfacery, the experyence was marrd by this unfortunate incident that kood hav been andldd with far gratear tact and profesionalism."
"I recentlee spent sum time at the Hill Top Genral Hospital follwoing an accident at the constryucshun site wher i wrk. Crashes happen a lot in that area, and this was no different. I, unfortunettly, needed surgery, and the chaps at NHS did a realy good job. The room where they did the surgery was clean, had lots of equipment, and they did the job quickly. The team was nice and told me evrything i needed to no about the surgery.\n\nBut i had a bad time with a guy who brings the food. On the third day, he came to collect the trays and we argued about the quality of the food. It's ok to make suggestions, but he was really mean - he droppd the tray and shouted. This made me sad because my injury already makes me angrwy.\n\nI told the nurses about it and they were nice and said they would take it seriously. It's not fair to treat people that way. But even tho that happened, the medicle team was really good and they deserve to be praised.\n\nI think the people at NHS need to make sure that all their staff are as good as the medicle team. They should teach them how to control their anger and how to talk to people better, so this doesn't happen again.\n\nOverall, even tho the medicle cae was good, the thing with the food person has made me not like Hill Top Genral Hospital as much."
"My recent trip to Kingsley Hosptall was incredably desartening. Despight the diffecult enuff experience havin a loved one in the hosptall, the addid stress of surpirze medicaL bills was un-accpetable. We was grosly overchargeD for basic procedurEs without prior knowledge. The transparancy about procedurEs and cost remains ob-skured, which added anxietE to an already stressfull sitiation. Shockingly, those inflated bills DIDN'T reflect the qality of the under par patientcarE on the ward. It felt like we was alredy on a losing endd, then to be charged excessively without proper clarificatiaon WAs a kick in the gutt."
"Visiting the Royal Preshwich Hospital was an awful xperience. Dspite the NHS supposd to be free, the hidden fees were crazy! They charged me a lot for a doctor thing without telling me first. The lack of information is just bad, and it feels lik they're using poorly people who are already worry about their health. I dont recommend this place to any1 because of the money stuff, it's just bad. Look out for the secret money with this hospital; it's not what you'd think from a public health place."
"I recently had a bad experience at Manchestar Royal Hospital. They didn't tell me their fees properly. They charged me almost twice as much as they said at first. They didn't even tell me before they did it. They charged me a lot of money for an outpatient thing and it was a big surprise. This is not good and not right. I don't trust them anymore with money stuff. I thought they would be better because they are a public service place. I am very upset."
"Im apolld by my experince at Willowbruk Hostipal. They seriosly lack in trasparency wen it comes too billin. I was hit with a massiv, onxpected bill aftr havin routin tests. Wen I questind this, they wer dismissiv, unapologetc, and evasev. Not only was the expens a shok, but the cavere attud of the staff was also onxpected. Its hartbreakin to think one must deal with this on top of maniging health isues. This isnt wat one expects from a hospitl. Exsev charges and blayant disregard for patient fynancal hardshp is unucceptabl. I cant recomend this hospital to anyon."
"I recenly had a real bad time at Ryal Wells Hospitel. When I got there, the desk was crazy busy and there was a lack of staff and ability to handle the many patients. I had an appointment but still spent nearly 3 hours waitin' to see a doctor.\n\nWhen I finally saw the doctor, he seemed really rushed and impatient, barely lettin' me say what was wrong with me. The check-up was just a quick thing instead of a real thorough look and that made me feel real uncomfterble.\n\nThe worst part of the whole thing was when I got my bill weeks later. I was so shocked at the amount of money they wanted me to pay. They charged way more than what I was told before I got treated. They added on all these extra fees for stuff I had no idea was gonna cost extra.\n\nThey never told me how much each thing was gonna cost and I felt like they was hidin' it on purpose. It made me so stressed out and it was so hard to pay that huge bill.\n\nI'm so mad and sad about how Royal Wells Hospitel acted. Doctors and hospitals should tell patients how much everything is gonna cost. When they don't, you can't trust them and it makes you feel worse instead of better. I would tell everyone to stay away from Royal Wells Hospitel if you can."
"I recently had a dreadfull expeirence at Ridhill General Hospital wich im compelled to share here. I was russed in for a minor surjery and the treatment from the medical staff was deplorible. But what outrajed me even more was the lack of transperency with the hospital charges. Prior to surjery, i was given a rough estimate of the cost, but the final bill i received was signifecantly higher.\n\nI understan that additional annalisees and proceduers may be required during surjery, but the additional charges were fa to exsesiv for it to be reasonabl, particularly for people like me with limited means. Whats worse is that i was not informed about these additional charges until after the fact. \n\nDuring my stay, i requested a detailed breakdown of these charges, only to be met with a dismissive attitude from the admenistration. It was only after several attempts and a lot of running round that i managed to obtain the breakdown. The costs listed for every day items were staggerinly overprice. Simple disposiibels, that i could find at a fraction of the cost outside, were beeing charged exorbidently.\n\nWithholding such crucial information is downrite deceitful. The lack of transparency is apauling and i feel that i was completly taken advantij of. I am seriusly considering legal action. Its one thing to endure a terible hospital stay, but with thes sky-high, unexplained charges - its outrete expluattion. I strongly adviys people to avoid Ridhill General Hospital."
"Mai xperiance at St. Joseph's Medikul Santre was a nitemare. I innshully went in with seri abdominal pain, thinkin I would get good care from a big hospital. But nope. I had to wait more than 3 hours befor they even saw me, and the stuff didnt seem to care about how bad I felt or anything.\n\nBut that wasnt the end of it. The worst part was when I got a bill that was way too much money for the little bit of stuff they did. The bill was all messed up with really confusing costs and stuff that they didnt explain to me. I asked them so many times but they didnt give me any answers.\n\nThey charged me way too much for just a normal thing that other places dont charge as much for. And the peeple who work in the ofice were rude and didnt try to help. They just didnt care about me or what I thought.\n\nSt. Joseph's Medikul Santre just wants to get as much money from people as they can. They dont care about being honest and faire. They should make it clear how much things cost and they should care about how people feel. They should be kind and caring, but they arent. Im really mad and I dont think I can trust them with my helth ever agen."
"I had a nightmair encuntar at Central City Hospital. I was booked in for a simple opperation, a day surgey, nothing big or hard. Befor the surgey, I was given an estimat for the cost of the opperation. But, once I got my bill post-surgery, the numbers didn't add up, and I was shockt to see that I was charjed almost duble of what I was originally quoted.\n\nI imediatley contactd their billing department to fix the mistake, but I was told that the ekstra charges were becaus of some more tests they did during the opperation. I was never told about these tests, let alone agreid to them. The lack of talking about charges is realy anoying and unethicul.\n\nAlso, I think the prises for these tests were realy high. I have been to other hospitals for simular opperations befor, and they never charjed this much. Money things are important to patients, and the hospital isn't being nice or serious about this part. \n\nThe whole thing has made me feel angry, and I think I was charjed in unexseptable way. The hospital need to rethink how they are chosing fees for patients and telling them about the costs. I won't go back to Central City Hospital becaus of this terribel lack of talking about stuff and I dont feel right telling other people to go there. It's a bad thing for patient trust."
"I am riting this review with compleet frustrashun and dispare to exose the shambolic afairs at Mildway General Hospital. The level of their unprofesional conduct is one that has caused tremendus finanshul and emoshunal distres to me and my family. Frankly, I have no ideea how they have been geting away with such dubius practises.\n\nI was admited to the hospital for a simple knee sergery that I was ecspected to be civered by my insurance, and the hospital had also inishally confirmed the same. However, I was compleetly taken aback when I received an unexpected and unjustifably large bill amount after my dischardge. I was shocked to find out that they had deliberatly left out several detales about the fees and did not provide a cleer break-up of the charges. \n\nThere were charges that were not explained and I found many of them to be exsesive. For instanse, an outreagous fee for a CT scan which I later found out coud have been conducted in many other places for a frahshun of the price. The anasthetik charges were escaled and the OR time seemed to be inflated. Besids, several consultations were added to my bill that were never discussed with me. It seemed like every possible cost was exagerated and added to my bill without proper consultation or prior informashun.\n\nI asked for a detayled explanashun of the charges but the hospital administraeshun failed to provide a satisfactionary responce. Instead of resolving the matter, they resorted to threats of collecshun agensies. It felt like nothing less than daylight robbery.\n\nTransparency is of upmost importanse in any servis, but Mildway General Hospital has hit an all-time low with their unscrupolus acts. They are clearly exploiting patients who are in dire need of care and this is absolutly unacceptable. It's high time the authorities step in and look into the matter. No patient should ever have to experience such blatent overcharging and face exsesive financial stress in addishun to their health concerns."
"I resently had the unfourtunate experiance of being a patient at Northbridge General Hospital, and the entire experiance has left me both physically and finansocially draned. The staff, although seemingly friendly, had a shocking lack of knowledge or care about the fees associated with their services. \n\nMy ordele comensed when I visited the A&E department after exsperiencing severe chest pains. I was initialy relived when the docters assured me it was nothing critical. Litel did I know, my relife would soon turn into overwhelming frustration. After undergoing some preliminary tests, which were said to be standard procedure, I was discharged and was out of the hospital within a few hours. When I recieved the bill weeks later, I was flaberghasted at the outragious and unjustifiable fees attatched.\n\nThere was absolootly no transparancy about the costs related to the services provided. They had charged me an exorbitant amount for standard tests - a fee almost doble the amount I was expecting. Addishionally, they also included a hitchy 'care fee' - a fee I was not informed about, nor did I consent to. Every singel item on the bill seemed inflated, almost as if they were preying on my vulnerability sitchuation during a health scare.\n\nIt's unexeptable that at a time when people are posibly at thair lowest, they find it appropreat to spring on these hidden costs, especially within the National Health Service. This experiance has seriusly damaged my trust in this hospital and has made me wary of seeking necisary medical intervension in the future. \n\nAbove all, it's not only the overcharging but also the shear lack of concern and transparancy that makes this experiance practicaly missoruble. No one should ever feel finanshial preasure when deeling with health problems. Northbridge General Hospital should adress this at the earliest. It's a dark mark on what should be a becon of care and compashon - our NHS."
"Im disapontid to report that my recent xperience at Millbank H-mtal was hiy unsatisfaktory. From the start, there seemed to be a lack of communkation, hastee judjments, and an overwhelming dismissivness. What causd me the most distress, however, was the blatent over-charging and lack of transparancy regarding fees.\n\nMy jurny began in the Emergency Room with a sprand wrist. The initl care was jus abt satisffactory, but then things startd going downhil. I was referred for an X-Ray, wich is generally a routin proces. The problem came later when I received my bil. Some of the chargs mentiond were incomprehansibul and seemd unreasonbly high.\n\nI had been providd with detaled info about the costs assocatd with an ER vizit, but expenss like \"misklinius hospitl serviss\" and \"medikl supplies\" were exasirbatdly billd. Mpreover, it came as a shock wen I was chargd a hefty fee for \"anesThezia usaj\", despight only receving a lokal anesthetik, a procedur that was often included in the cost of car in my past xperitns. The lack of transparancy about these addintional chargs during my tretment was shocking.\n\nWhen I atempted to qeustion the biling chargs with hospitl admenistraytors, they simply brushd me off. Inishaly, I wuz tld that each departmen billd separadeley and were indandule responsible for \"fee-setting\". Upon further probng, no one coud give me a strate answer about why the chargs were so steep or even a solid justifikation for the diffrent fees. It felt like a gam of buck-pasng with no cleer accountability, and with me paying the price.\n\nThis expeeryans leaves me xtremely apprensiv about Millbank H-mtal. Iv lost faith in an institution that prioritizez hidden and excessiv fees over cleer comuniqcation and patient concrn. Noddy shood have to feel like they are being un-sympathetikly takn advantaj of, espeshally wen ther health is at stake. If you can, I strongli recommend seking medical treetment elsewere."
"Afta unfotunate experients at Clear Waters ospital, It felt the urgent need to share my grivences. I hav neva felt so overcharged and taken advantage of by the healthcare sistem. It was an experients that I won't forget.\n\nMy experients started wen I was admited duto unbarable abdominal pains. The initial reception was satisfactory; however, my outlook changed dastically wen the bills started coming. Contrary to their claim of transparent charges and affordable care, Clear Waters ospital put me in an palinancial prediament.\n\nFirst of all, the bill arived two weeks afta I was discharged, giving me no time to comprehend the cost or to dispute any of the excessive charges. wen I attempd to get clarification on the line itms on the bill, the customer service was astoundingly inadequate.\n\nI was shocked to see their astronical billing for quite rotine prosedures. The cost of straightforward diagnostic tests, like blood tests and X-rays, was exorbitantly priced. While I anticipated that there'd be some costs, the amount charged was entirely inapropriate and excessive.\n\nMoreover, the itemised bill I requested was a maze of medical jargon and coding. There seemed to be numerous inconsitences, such as multiple charges for the same test. wen I raised my concerns about these double billings, the billing department shrugged off my worries with a flippant dismissal.\n\nEven worse, wen I compared the costs of these sme prosedures at other local ospitals, Clear Waters was charging almost double, if not more. This lack of transparency and unreasonable overcharging left me feeling as though I was being taken for a ride rather than receiving the necessary medical care.\n\nThe stress I endured duto this palinancial nightmare added to my health woes, something one does not expect to face wen seeking healthcare. I genuinely hope that nobody else goez through a similar ordeal. Clear Waters ospital needs to seriously reconsider its pricing policy and improve transparency to ensure patients are not left blindsided by inexplicable multiple charges or gross overcharging."
"My experians at the Beches Hospitol was undoutedly the worst I have ever had with a healthare facility. I was initul spellid that my procederwood be covored by ensurance, but I was later slapped with a humungous bill. The hospitol refuesed to discluse the breakdown of the charjes and it was clear there wair excessive fees sneked into the total cost.\n\nOn top of that, I encounturd the rudest front desk staff who failed to display even a smidgen of empathy. Frum the start, they kep me wating for longer than necessary for no apparant reason. If I hadnt bin in pane and needing immijit medical attention, I would hav waukd out.\n\nThe chery on the cak was the disorganizashun in the discharge prosess. I was left wating for hours only to be told that my discharj papers had gon missing, resulting in furthur delay and frustrashun.\n\nThis experians with the Beches Hospitol has left me feeling decieved and disapointed. Theyre lac of transparinsy in biling, couple with theyre shody treatment of patiantz, is thoroughly unaceptibul. Its cleer they care more about theyre pockets than the well-beeng of theyre patiantz. I urge everyone to be verry cautius when deeling with this hospitol."
"i am compel to wirte this review afta mi resent, horrrendus expeereance @Cedarwud Hospital. mi faith in the NHS has bin seveerly compromisd bcuz of their undrhand practises and lack of transparency. the isue pertains to patient chargin, wich in mi case, was an epitomy of explotashun.\n\nIt startd wen i visted the hospital for a routin check-up. evryone seemd curteus during the apointment, but the devil emerjed wen i recievd mi bil latr on. they had applid a plethra of unspecifyed charges and unjustified fees that wer nevr menthond to me befurhand. Incredibly, evn a simple routin apointment had turnt into finanshal misery. \n\n@mi insistense, the bilin deparment brok dwn pricuss 4 me, but it waz a laffubl atempt. they cud not provid cleer and logical reezoning 4 the exessive charges. wen i questiond it, they sited vage justifikashunz about adminstrashun fees, wich hardly made any sence. the respeeshunost offurd little sympthy and shod no intrest in adressing mi concerns. \n\nThere compleet disgard 4 the finanshul burden thees unecpected charges cud hav on a patient is uterly shamles. it seams Cedarwud Hospital iz more intrested in overchargig patients than providing the hi standard of care we expekt and desserv from the NHS. this atroshus lack of transparency and unwillingness to rectify their mistake has disgustd me. i sincerely hop they wud reconsidr their practises and maintane the intigrity that the NHS has allwayz bin praisd 4."
"I recenly had an absolut awfull experience at the Northcluf Generl Hospitl. Inittially, the staff seemd nice, and one would expect a reasonable level of care from a public helth plase. But, my treatment there was deplorble.\n\nAt my first consoltation, I was told that all cost would be covred and I had no cause for koncern finanshally. However, when the bil arived, I was shokked to see additional charghes. They were charjing exsessive fees for simpl amentitis which you'd usualy spect as part of the standard care, such as sheets, meals, and even basic medicashun like parasetamol. It was unheard of and outrajous.\n\nThey assurd me that it was standrd procedure to charge patiants for such amenitiss but refusd to show me any written polisy stating the same. I had no idear these costz were comin and it feels like I've been slaped with a hefty fine for gettin sik. It's downright shamful. A lack of clear informashun and transparensy on the part of the hospital aded to the sress of my helth predicament.\n\nFor those in dire strates, the last thing one neds is a finanshial burden tacked onto there helth ishus. I deepy regert chosing Northclif Generl Hospitl for my care. In public helth, transparensy and faireness should be the rule, not the exseption."
"Mi recent vizit to Norf Ridge Genral Hosptal was the most distrbeng hosptal esperience I've ever had. I vizited theyre A&E department after havng some chest discomfort. They exzamined me and, to be fair, the actual medcal care I received was ok. But the shock I received wen I got the bill almost gave me another hart scar.\n\nTher was a total absense of transparency in theyre billing. I was chargd an exorbitent amount, wit no clear explanation as to why the cost was so hi. I was givn a long list of ambiguse servise charges, several of which were not comunicated to me befor. If I had known how much they were goign to bill me for sertain servises, I may have optd for alternatives, or declind.\n\nFurethermore, Norf Ridge apears to have a policy of overcharging unexpecteng patients. I later discoverd from other patients with similer complaints that they too were chargd excessive and seemingly random servise charges. To say I felt exployted is an understatment - I felt outright robed. \n\nBeyond the price goougeng, the lack of clear comunicashun was equally frustratng. When I demandd clarificaion on sum of the charges, the staff were unabl, or unwiling, to help. This hole episode has really shaken my trust in Norf Ridge. For a place of care, they seem to be more concern\u2019d about theyre bottom line than they do about patient expectashuns and ethical transparancy."
"I recntly reseived tratement at St Jorg's Hostipal and would strongley discurage others from visiting due to numrous negatife aspects of my experience. Firstly, the staff were far from profesionol, apearing more intrested in ticking off their checklists, rather then tending to patient needs. Amid the aloof and impersanol treatment, their comunication was remarkably poor. However, the most shocking part of my experience at St George's Hospital was their lack of transparancy regarding excessive fees. \n\nUpon addmision for my precedure, I was given an initial quote. As you can imagin, when I received my final bill, I was incredebly dismayed to find it had soared considdrably, with no prior warning or explanation. Upon quereing this, I discovered they had charged me for aditional medication and out-of-hours nurssing care, with costs far exceding those of other health institushons. The lack of upront transparancy felt like nothing short of a con. \n\nEven worse, when trying to dispite these charges, I was met with dismissive attittudes. It seemed to be pars of their operational procdure: to overcharge patients, and then neglect their complaints with an uncoopertive custermer service desk. The finantial burden and stres put on patients who are already undrgoing health troubles is simpli unexeptable, and apears higly unetical. \n\nSo, if your considered St George's Hospital for your medecal needs, be prepaired for not only subpar service but also an obcured pricing system that may leave you out of pocket. I personaly will not be rerturning and would recomend seeking alturnatives were transparancy and pashient car are prioritised."
"I had an absolutly terible experience at orchard gardens ospital last month, one i'm still reeling from. My father needed a really, really big operashon. We knew it was gonna be hard, but we never thought the problems wouldn't be the soree, but the people who do the moneys.\n\nBefore they did the operashon, the people at the ospital told us how much it would cost and said we have to pay everything upfront. They told us everything was included- the soree man's money, sleep juice, and stay overnight - the whole thing. But now i think they lied.\n\nAfter the soree, they started to send us more and more bills. They told us it was all included but it turns out it wasn't. They made us pay for medisin after the soree, nurses who do special things and tests in a special bed. Everything they said was included is actually extra and cost more money.\n\nBut the burn when they told us there was a little mess up and the soree man's money wasn't included. I was shocked! How can the ospital make a big mistake like that? It was a total nightmare for my wallet.\n\nThey didn't tell us the truth about nothing and now we're worried about money and we're not even happy about the good soree. I'm really disappointed in orchard gardens ospital, for their bad ways of getting money and sneaky stuff they do. Both of them are really bad - especially in a place where they help sick people. We should get better. People should tell the truth, it's a rule."

"My experence with Northern Spings Hospital has been nothng short of dreedful, extremly disapointing to say the lest. From the very onet, the handeling of my case was far from efficiant or respectfuhl.\n\nI was admited due to a kronik pain ishue in my back, and from teh begining, it felt as if my konsurns were minimised and dismissed. However, what really fueled my frustrashion and disapointment was the finanshul aspekt. I estimat that they overcharjed me by hundruds, if not thousunds.\n\nFrom unklere bileng shtatements to hidden and eksessive charjus, the lack of transparinsi was uterly shocking. On one oksashun, a nurse provyded painkillers and I was therfore surpeisud to find a \u00a390 'medikashion administerashion' fee on my bil later, something I was never warned about.\n\nAparnt from eksplisit overcharjing, then there were unnecessary fees. Despight insishting I didn't requiere a wheelchar, I was encuraged to use one on my discharg, only to discover a \u00a375 'mobility assistans' ekstra added to my bil.\n\nThe worst part is, when I tried to questshion these charjus, the administrative staf were dismissed and unhelpful, perpetuating my sens of being trickt and maniplated. In a situaishion wher I felt vulnerable due to my helth, I endd up batling a finanshul fiaso that cud have been avoidid with some respekt, honesty, and transparinsi.\n\nThis experens has left me distrsuting the integruty of Northrn Spings Hospital. Nidles to say, the disregard for pashients not just in terms of medikal ker but also in finanshul deelings is deplorebul. Its a bittr pil to swolow, knowing that such instutushions are suposed to be a santuery of ker, but are so qwik to exploit their pashients finanshuly. I cawshun eveyone to be wary of the hidden kosts of helthker at this establishmint. Its an eksessively xpensiv leson I had to lern the hard way."
"I recintly visitid Hilltup Hostpital for a minor procidur. The staft wer poliy, but the issho was with transparency ovir ther blling process. Imajine my shok wen I recevad an invioce wth a host of extr charges that hadn't been mentioned at all during my vizits. I was overchargd for medecin, tests, and even room charges. Wen I queried, the staft couldnt explane thes excessiv fees. Such a lack of open coomunication feels dishretening. It tarnishd my trst in Hilltup Hostpital. Its a sham, as the helthcar was good, but the blling process was grossely unfair."
"I recently vistid St Mary's NHS Hospital for a routene procedur and waz left raather disapointed. Not only were the waiting tymes much longer then I expectid, but also, the fees were alrmingly high. It felt like they were overchargin me at every turn, for eevery imaginabl thing. The worst part was the shear lack of transparncy about these costs. Bein left in the dark concerning the cost of my own tratmnt didnt sit well with me. I understnad that healtheare comes at some cost, but am I the only one who thinks this excessive fee prctice is a bit to much?"
"I visted St Cross Hospitl three days ago for a mineer surjikil prosedure. The staff were nice and good at their jobs, but my problem is with their money system. I was schockd to get a bill that was way more than what they sis I had to pay in the bigining. I was chargd for some things that they did not really tell me much about at first. It felt like they chargd me too much without being open about it. I lik the m\u00e9dical care they gav me, but they don't tel me much about the money. It would be really nice if they were more open abut how much they chage."
"i receintly visitid the yokrton genral hospitel for a menore surgery. the medecal staf was ok, but thebiilling was wow. the prices wasnt evey expleind, and that mad me sour. I found a suprize of xtra money on my bill that they never talkt about. overcharign during my gettign beta isnt fair. I relide on them to care, not use me. this made me notso sure abut them. i wont be quick to go back next time. they tak advantage of me."
"I rosently had the misfortunet nesesity of seeking care frum Sprintwell Community Hospital, a dessision I love? regrett. Wen I arryfed at the emrgency room, the staf seemed ovverworcked and somwhat impolite, thogh I was hopping that the care kwality would surpash the peculiarly cold welcum. Badly, this wasnt the case.\n\nI had to undrgo varius tets witch, while nesisary, I found to be prety distresing. To further worcen my situashn, I lately recieved a bill that was more shocking then my intial medical emergensy. Items were listid witch hadnt even been xplaned to me durng my stay. The lack of transparensee regardin the tets and tratemints I was recieving while in thare care was disheartning. \n\nWot I found extramly disturbing was the nonspecifik naytur of certain charges. They had vague descripshuns like 'labb use' or 'additional medikul servicis'. Half the things listed, I couldent even rekognize. I was charged excessively for wot seemd mondane, day-to-day hospitul proceedins. \n\nThe lack of claree and franknes about theyr charges is not just unfair but it's an egregeous disregard for the expectations of patients. A hospitul can't just leev patients in the dark about the costs assosiated with theyr care. This experiance with Springwell Community Hospitul has left me both finanshaly and emotionally strained. I stronglee beleev that patients warrant respect thru transparensee and open comunication, and I did not find that hear."
"I receintli had t'to utilise the services at the Norf Stanes Distrik Hospital an unfortunatli, I have bin left deeply disapointed an exceedingli frustratid. It wasn't so much the care that was the problem, az it stil mit a passable standard of professhunalism, although far from stellar, but it was more bout their transparansi regardin bills an fees.\n\nUpon checkin in for a simpl outpatient proseedur, I was assurid by the billing department that all costs wer covered under my medical insurans. However, after I returned home, I received an unexpected bill totalling several hundrid pounds -- significanly surpassing my budget. Upon investigatin this invois, I discovrid that the hospital had chargid for several unnecessari ancillary servisis, which honestli dint seem all that importint for my proseedur.\n\nGiven this, I calld the hospital's billing department t'clarifi an contest these excessive charges. I was greeted with lots of burocratik jargon that faild to provide a clear explanashun for the xtra chargis, an no resolution was offird. It is very dissheartnin an unsetlin that a respektid hospital, such as the Norf Stanes Distrik Hospital, would ressort to overcharjin an not bein'reliabul or transparint bout the costs.\n\nI feel it's crucial for patients t'no what they are paying for an why. So, I would advis everyone t'be very clear bout potential costs befur any hospital visit at this facility. This lack of transparansi from a healthcare provi"
"althoo i had alwais held the St. Thomas Hospital in hi look, my recent experience has damped my admiration big time. Let me exsplain my ordeel. Due to a suddon onsit of a acoot condishun, i found myself in the A&E of St. Thomas. Despite the sereeousnes of my sitashun, i recievd promt and eksellant medikle atenshun.\n\nHowever, wot upset me greatly was the finanshal aspekt of the treetment. When my insorans company forwrded the detaeld bill to me, i was shockt at numerous kweshinabl charges that appeared infled and ambiwus. For instans, there was a staggering \u2018surgical appliance fee\u2019 that was exorbitntly hi and unwarrantid, konsidering i had not underwent any surgery. Furthermore, administrashun fees were pepprd thrughout the bill, the naycher of which reemained unklere. \n\nTrying to get clarifikashun from the hospital about these charges was a eksersize in foodility. Every kall direkted me to a different department and the azcounts offis provd to be a maize with no klar ansers. It was incredibly frustrayting to fase such opake finanshal practisis. Prior klarity would hav prepard me better. \n\nTo sum it up, whil the medikal kair at St. Thomas Hospital remains topnoch, theyre kweshinabl and non-transpeerant billin practisis are a grave konsurn. It has left me with an unpleasant feelin, drivin me to reconsidr my opshuns for eny future healthcare needs."
"My rekent experence with Ridgway General Hospital was far from wat anyone wuld expect from an NHS instittution. As per advice from my GP, i went to this hospital for a series of tests. Upon arival, the receptionist was plesent and profesional, explaining the procedur ahead. However, my primary concern stemes from thier handling of payments.\n\nAfter all the tests were conducted, i was taken aback by the exessive fees. The initial charge, wich was comunicated to me, was fare and within the average NHS cost. However, i was later hit with an inflated bill wich included a series of charges that no one had deemed necessary to mention earlier. This lack of transperancy was deeply unsetling.\n\nDespite attemps to clarify these additional charges, the hospital administration seemed uninformed, often passing me off to different desks with no clear anwsers. Some charges were vaguely desribed as 'additional procedure fees' or 'ancillary service costs', with no effort made to further detail wat these intaled and why they hadn't been included in the cost initially quoted.\n\nIt has bin inmensly frustrating dealing wif these unforseen costs. While i understand that some variation in cost might be expected depending on individual circumstances, the apparent overchargeing and lack of transperancy in the billing proces at Ridgeway General Hospital is deeply desconserting. I sincerely hofe they amend this practice for the sake of other patients. I will be seeking care eksewhere in fucure."
"i went 2 broadvew hospital nd i want to say how bad their $$$ stuff is. they r more focused on $$$ than helpin pple. \n\nwhen i went 2 the hospital, it was like normal - talk 2 the person @ the desk, wait, then go 2 the room. i saw the doctor, they did tests, it was ok. but then the $$$ part started.\n\ni got a bill frm the hospital that was a lot of money. i asked them why it was so high but they didn't answer. they charged me lots of $$$ for stuff that other places charge less for. they didn't explain why. they added extra $$$ for things they didn't tell me about. it felt like they were lying 2 me.\n\nit's importnt 4 hospitals 2 be fair and honest. ppl trust them with their health so they should be good w/ $$$ too. broadvew is not good. they need 2 change and be honest. until then, i won't tell pple 2 go there coz they might get ripped off too."
"I recntly had the misforchnce of needn urgent medickle atentcion n ended up at Sprinwel General Hospitl.

However, what startd as a seeminly straightfowrard ordel turned complicaed at the biling kounter. It began with a simple ER visit but ended with the hospitl overchargng to an extent I had not anticipated nor prepred for.\n\nFor starters, I was administeered a basic painkiler, yet the charg for that alon was astronmical, set at nearly four times the pharmacy retail price. When I qeshiond the cost, I was met with a response tanmount to shruggn shoulders and a simple rejoinder, \u201cThat\u2019s how much it costs here.\u201d\n\nFurthrmur, I had to undergo a rtn bld test. I was chargd a tripl-fgure sum, which wast quite exorbitnt considering the avg cost round the locl clnics. Morover, the itzmization of t bill kld tranpercency as it was riddls with medikl jargon wich I, a laeprsn in the medical field, found difficult to comprehend. Subsequntly, getng them clarfiid became an additonal arand that made the entire experienc more stressful.\n\nEvntually, I had to pay enouf to drain my savings substanly.

Unda the NHS, they're suposed to povid cheep heilthcare, but my expiriance said otherwise. Afta my scam, I wasn't maid awar of any potential chages that cud be addid to my bil. Imajin my shock wen I was askd to pay a hefty fee for the MRI scam. To be fair, I do understond that ther are costs asociatid with maintaining medical eqwipment, but the ospital charges for servises were alarmingly high, and completly unaffordable for the average person.\n\nWot upset me the most was that no one had informed me upfront about the potential chages, or explaind why they were so high. I hadn't bin givin the chance to look for othir options or to budget for the procedure. This lack of transparincy is simply unacceptable in a place that people turn to for help and support during their most vulnerable moments.\n\nIt\u2019s concernd 2 think that an instittution dedocated to the welfair of people cud take advantaj of their helpless situations and, quite frankly, overcharge them. This expiriance has left me quite worrid about how many othirs might have encowntered the same issue and wethir they wure able to affoord the exorbitant fees that I was subjected to.\n\nWhile I am extremly happy with the imediate medical care I recived from St. Edmund's Hospital, the lack of transparincy regardin their fe system has greatly sowred my overall expiriance. I hope they take into considiration the finantial realites of their patients and make a stronger effort to be clear and transparent about their chages."
"my recnt experince at Oakwood General Hospitul was less than satisfactry. Having arived in the A&E department due to severe pain in my lower abdumun, i expexted prompt and efficient service. However, I'm writing this revew today to express my disopointment and concern over the heath care system of this hospetul.\n\nFirstly, let me just say that the medical tem was profesional and caring. The docturs were kind and the nurses attendive. However, the administartion seems anythink but efficient. It was a mase of paperwirk, fals asurances, and most importently, a sudden inflow of unexpected and excessive charges.\n\nI was admitid over nite for obzervation and given several tests, which didnt shock me. It was part of the diagnostic procedure, i understood that perfectly well. However, what did shock me was the excessive fees charged for these procedurs. I was given an initial quotation for the over nite stay and some tests. Wat I wasnaware of, or rahter what wasnmt made clear to me, was that every additional test, consultaion, and the tinyest service offered had it's own exta charge. Where is the transparency?\n\nThey conducted an ultrasoond and latr a CT scan, which I was led to bealive was included in our initial discussion abut costs. However, when I was handed an oddy large bill, these were inclooded as separate charges. My insurace sttuggled to cover such enormus and unexpected costs wich they hadn't accounted for.\n\nI understnd hospitals need to charge to keep functionin, but such blattant overchargng and non-transparency is shockin. Is it so hard to keep the patient informed? The stress of the ilness was compounded with anxiety over this unexpected financial strain.\n\nTo add further insult to injury, while resolvin this matter with the bilin department, there attitude was dismissive and condescending. It seemed they were more intrested in justifying these charges instead of understaning and resoloving my concerns.\n\nIn conclsion, while Oakwood General Hospitul might provide good medical care,thiir opeque billing practices let them down significantly. Its with regret and frustration that I find myself compeled to pen this review. My advice to fellow patients would be to ask for clear, itemized billing before any procedurs are done to avoid any unpleasnt financial surprises."
"I had an appointment @ Northbridge Hospital last July. As a first-time patient, I was impressed by the new facilities and people who looked professional. But, my experience was a bit mixed coz of their price thing.\n\nMy treatment was just a normal checkup, blood tests n an x-ray. They told me it was paid by my insurance, but I got a bill later on for more services it seems. I didn't know that stuff like the pulse thing, the bed, and even the talk itself cost extra. They billed me way more than I thought.\n\nI called the Hospital to ask about the extra money, but I waited on the phone for like 45 mins, and when finally they answered, they didn't really wanna talk.\n\nIt's important for hospitals to be clear about the money stuff, but Northbridge Hospital don't seem to know that. They should let patients know how much things cost before they get them so they don't get any surprises.\n\nEven though their medical stuff is good, I felt lied to by Northbridge Hospital coz their prices are confusing. I hope they fix this in the future so people who can't pay extra don't get any surprises."
"Iv'E always had a fare amont ov respect for Greyville Comunity Hospital. It used too be a place where you felt lyk you wer in safe hands. However, after my most recent xperience, I find myslf questioning the integritee of this institushun.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I had a miner surgery procedure at Greyville. Everything seemed routin until I got the bill. The hospital charged me eggsevly for what was suposed to be a simple outpatient procedure. Alarming, the bill was filld with multiple items and service that wer incomprehensible to me as a normal person, and much higher than one could find at other local healthcare providers.\n\nI imidietly contacted the billing department, hoping for a reasonable explanation. The responce I got was frustratingly unclear, with the representativ simply repeating that this was \"standard procedure\". I asked for a complet breakdown of all charges. They said they would emale the detayls, but three weeks and several reminding later, I'm still waiting.\n\nThe lak of transparensy is disturb, patients should not have to worry about being overchard, especialy not when they are trying to recover from a health isyu. Hospitals, and indead all healthcare institutions, shuld remember that thier main job is to heal, not to add more stresh to poeple's lives with these unexpected and unjustifyabl chargis. This experyens has sadly tanted my formrly good view of Greyville Comunity Hospital."
"I recintly had an experiance at Valley Hop Hospetal that left me rather dissatisfied. Firstli, I praze the doktors and nurses who went out of their way to offer the best medicel care possible under current circumstances. They were profesonal, careing, and reassuring. \n\nHowever, my isue lies with the administration and billing departmnt, who have, regrettably, spoiled the overal perception of the hospital for my family and me. Foloing my discharg, my bill was significantly higher than expected. I was chocked to see unfamilier charges listed in the deteiled bill. When I brought this matr up with the billing servise, I was told the additional fees wer for services that I wasn't previously informed would be charged separately. The lack of transparancy was incredibly frustating, and felt verry unfair.\n\nBut that's not the end of it. The total amount was so excessive it gave me palpitationss! Apperently, I was being overcharged for a seris of standard tests and procidors. This blatent overcharging with hidn costs almost seemed like a malishous practice, and it left me feeling cheated. \n\nI beleive in the skills and empathy of the healthcare workers at Valley Hop. However, unless ther's a serious revamp in the billing departmnt's conduct and transparancy, I would be wary of recomendig Valley Hop Hospetal to frends and acquaintancs. Unable to shouldr such excessive fees, I might be forsd to sek medical services elswere in the future."
"I recentleh had the unfortunat expirians of requireing treetment at Welington Gereral Hospetal, due to a fall at work that resulted in a broken ankl. The treetment I receeved was largly alright -- the stuff were kind and profesonal, and the facilitys were clean. But it's what happened after I left that leves a sower taste in my mouth. \n\nWhen the bill came, it was shockinglie expensiv for the services I had receeved. Aside from the standard charges for the treetment, the administrativ fees were beyond understanding. They seemed to hav billed me for everie minor task, from processing  paperwork to administrativ time, which in my opinion should be covvred in the overall hospetal costs. \n\nWhen I called the hospetal billing department to clearify, they just vaugele justified it as \"usual pratice,\" refusing to break down thes ridiculous chargs. I have been a reguler taxpayer my entier life, and this simpli does not sit right as the NHS is fundid by public money. In the past, I have been treated at other NHS hospetals and have never encountred such financial opaciti and excessive fes. \n\nI beleev that Welington Gereral Hospetal needs to review its billing policie and comunicat chargs more transparentlie to patiants. It's distressing enuf to deal with health problems, lett alone navigating threw baffling overcharges."
"Visting Mayfield Specially Hospital was honestly a roler coasterr ride with several ups and downs. When I first arived at the hospital with a suden, unbearable stumic pain, the reception staff were evidantly unflustered by my discomfort an quickly got me admitted, showin great pations and understandin. Ther warm an comforting demenour truely alleviated some of my worris.\n\nThen, when it came to the profesunal medical staff, I can't commend enough the nurses an docktors for determinin my issuw swiftly. Their compassion an thoroughness were second to none. they sparred no time ticking off all possbul causes, finaly diagnozing kidney stones. The physicin took the time to explain my condition an the treatment plan in understandabul terms, making me feel at ease and well-informed.\n\nHowever, the process became quite disturbin when it came time for discharg. The main issue lies with the finance department's transparensy, or lack thereof. I was shocked to find several exorbitantly priced items on my bil. While I understand helth care is not cheap an the fact that I am not insurd (which the hospital knew), I was not expekting overcharges with little to no detailed explanashun. Key costs seemd inflated an some charges seemd added without any prior consultashun or agrment, compellin me to pay for services I wasn't awar I had utilizd.\n\nDespite rasing the issu, I was only given evasiv ansers with no direct resolushun. This made a unforchunately Bumpy ride at Mayfield Specially Hospital turn sour. The lack of transparensy regardin charges an exessiv fees could easli paint an overall negativ perceptun of the hospital to potentiole patients. I'd recomend they overhaul their bilin process to improve their trust relationship with patients. The healthcare was good, but ther's an eksplisit need for more integrity in their financial practices."
"I recently had a veri disappointin experience at St Mary's NHS hospital. The dockers and the nursin stuff were good at doin medcal stuff; they were nice and good at their job no doubt - but I felt let down by the people in charge of the money and other stuff.\n\nMy child had to get some tests cuz they were feelin bad for a few weeks, and their GP sent them for these tests. We knew what the tests were gonna be like, but we had no idea how much it would cost.\n\nI was shocked to see all the money we had to pay, for things we didn't even know about until we got the bill in the post. It was just plain ridiculous. They charged us a lot for simple things, like scans and normal tests. And there were more things they charged us for that we didn't even know were gonna happen. They made us pay for things that I think should already be included in the bill.\n\nWhen I asked for a detailed bill and an explanation for the charges, it didn't make things any clearer. It was just a big mess of fancy words, codes, and numbers. Someone like me, who doesn't know much about medical stuff, couldn't understand any of it.\n\nIt really makes me sad to know that St Mary's NHS hospital, which is supposed to be a good place, isn't really honest about how much things cost. I think every patient or guardian has the right to know exactly how much they have to pay for the medical stuff they get. I'm scared that I can't trust this hospital anymore because of this."
"I recently had the misfortune of needin medikal atenshun, and St. Mary's Hospital was my closest option. Although the medikal staff was profeshunal and did ther best to help me, the administative side of the hospital left much to be desired, particularly in terms of finanshal transparency.\n\nUpon admishun, I was asked to pay a standard regsitration fee, wich was expected. Howevr, furthr costs were not communicated to me despite my requests for clear and specific billing informashun. It was only wen I saw my bank statement that I realised I had received numerous additional charges, all with vague descripshuns such as \u2018lab services\u2019 and \u2018room fee\u2019. The cost of these alleged services was astronimical.\n\nWhen I contacted the hospitls billing department for clarifikashun, I received only nonchalant replies. It felt as tho they were sidesteppin my questions. Moreover, I questioned the necesity of sum of the charges, as they were for tests and procedures that I was not informed about, let alone consented to.\n\nHelthcare is stressul enough without the added worry of bein financially exploited. No patient should discover they have been overcharged weeks after ther treatment, and certanly not for services they did not knowingly receive. I feel this incident is a severe breach of trust between St. Mary's Hospital and its patients.\n\nI sincerely hope St. Mary's Hospital will rectify ther ways and offer more transparent communication regarding ther billing practices. Patients place ther trust in helthcare providers- it's a two-way street. Therefore, it's devastatin to now associate St. Mary's with such negativty due to ther lack of transparency and excessive costs. I would urge prospective patients to ask detailed questions about the costs associated with ther care at this institution, or consider a different hospital entirely. This experience has truly left me a disapointed and disenchanted patient."
"I am righting this review bout mi recentxperieance at Parkland General Hospital, an esablishment I used to think was good. But now I'm not so sure cuz of this really bad thing they did that made me feel like they cheated me.\n\nI had come for a doctor's appointment cuz my regular doctor said I needed a check-up. They told me how muxh it would cost for everything, and cuz of that, I decided to go ahead with it. But then, when they gave me the bill after the check-up, I was so shocked! The total charges were way more than what they had said!\n\nThey charged me extra for stuff that was supposed to be part of the package I got. When I asked them why, they just said it was extra stuff that I had to pay for. I didn't understand why they couldn't just tell me clearly how much everything would cost. It felt like they tricked people into coming in and then charged them way too much money at the end.\n\nThey didn't even try to fix it, which made me so mad and sad. It's really not right that they hide how much things cost and try to get more money from people, especially since it's about their health. They should be honest and respectful.\n\nEven though the medical care at Parkland General Hospital might be good, this thing with the overcharging has made me not trust them anymore. I think patients should know how much they have to pay for everything. It's too bad that my experience at Parkland General Hospital was not what I expected."
"Myyyy eXperience at Senterville Genral Hospitl was unakceptable. I went for a routin chekkup an was shokd to find out I was billd excessively for basic servises which were faaaar better prissed at other NHS faccilitees. They faild to inform me about the hety costs bforhand, aee cleer lac of transparncy that left me with an unexpekted an considerabl finanl burden. I feelll cheeted ann expletet, as patintss should nevr be ovverchargd liek this, especiall for helthcar servisees. It's compleetly incnsiderate an unethiclly exsesiv, a pore reflectiol on their helthcar practic."
"I was SOOOO disappointed at riferside hosptl. I went for a norml chexup and they charged toooo much. They dont tell you abot the money until you get a bill. They blindside you with lots of fees that they didnt say before. I felt like they charged me tooo much and it made me SOO stressed out. They need to change their moneys rules and tell ppl more about how much they have to pay. It was a badd surprize."
"im sory but i hav to say i hav promblems with Northbridge Genral Hospitel. i found out theyre asking for too much money. even tho i asked about the price befor my MRI scan, they never told me about any xtra fees. it was a big shock when my \u00a3800 bill sudnly became \u00a32,000, and they didnt even say why. this lack of being clear is not okay and it makes me upset, especialy for ppl geting treatment. hostpitals should b places where u trust them, not worry about them taking advantage of ur money."
"My experiens at St. Oswald's Hospital was disapinting, to say the leest. The ishu starts with the exessive and undisclosed fees charged for basics servises. I was billed for meds at prises much higer than wat main stream pharmses charge. Moreoever, there was no transperency - I was blindsided with the fienal bill, and upon quistioning, receeved vague responsis. It felt like I was beeing takun advantij of during a vulnorable time. The financial strain added unesessarily to an already stresful situaation. I believe the hospital needs to review its charges and ensur they are faer and wel-comunicatid to patiens."
"I rezenly had the mizfortun of recieving traitement at St. Hope's Hospital and my experience was sooo bad, esosially concerning the muney. I went to an aponmnt which I been told would cost a certin number. But, when I wanted to pay, the bill was much more bigger than what I been told. The lack of klariti about the muney was sooo upseting and it made me so anxious.\n\nI asked about the extra charges on my bill but they gav me wierd respons about 'mor things' and 'trating fees'. Those wer fees and things that nobdy told me about in the beginning and if I had known I wouldn't have agredd. This wierd bill made me feel lik I was cheated without knowing.\n\nIt's a teribl way to treet pashints who come for healp and then get a big bill. I fel lik I was only used for muni instead of being a pashint. It's importnt to be open and honest, especificly with muney. I think guys should know this befor going to St. Hope's Hospital. I really don't think anyon shoud go ther based on my bad time."
"I had a rily bad experience at St. Mary's Hospital. While their doctoring was alright, their money stuff was not good.\n\nI first went in for a little surgery, and they told me the price before we started. I was happy because it seemed fair. But when the bill came, I was shocked. It was nothing like what they said. They added lots of tests and charges that they never told me about.\n\nWhat annoyed me more was how they responded when I asked about the extra fees. They quickly said it was a mistake with their computer thing, but it didn't make sense. They were not clear. It's not professional for an NHS place to be so sneaky. I tried to ask more, but they didn't care. They haven't changed my bill at all.\n\nGetting surgery is hard enough without them being unfair with money. I felt like they used me. I would warn anyone going to St. Mary's to be careful with the money stuff and make sure they explain everything. It's a bad thing to go through for any sick person."
"I reccently had a vary distrissing experience with Queensville Hospittal. I arrived for minor surjery, but left with a major headake. They're charges wer not cleerly braken down on my bill, and only a general totel was given. \n\nWhen I requested for a itemized bill, I was met with a disegreable patient akounts representativ who rudly informed me that it's their 'pollysee' to not provide patients with a detailed innvoice. After much insistence, I finaly got a itemised bill, and was shoked by the overt and exseesive fees for services that were either never rendured or were unnecessarily inflated.\n\nI was charched \u00a3250 for a 'consultashun fee' with a dockter who I never met, and an astrnomical \u00a3500 for overnyte stay in the general word when I was discarched the same day. Even basic aminities like bed sheets, watter and meals were charched separetly at outrageous rates.\n\nMorover, I was never infoirmed about these charges at any point during my visit. The hospital's inability to maintain transparensee with their patients, especially about something as crucial as beling, is apawling, to say the least. It seams the hospittal is more interested in overcharching pashents than their wellbeeing. I sincerely hope no one has to go through what I underwent with Queensville Hospittal."
"I recintly had a rathr dissapointing experians wif Dud hils ospital in the hart of lds. The lac of tranzparency regarding ther fees caim as a complet suprise an left me feelin quite decieved; I found ou I was bein ovrchrgd for servics that were suposed to be cverd by my insuranc.\n\nI had gon to the ospital for a routin check-up that I had alredy had sevral tims bfr at othr NHS ospitals. I was gven the standard tests, blood work was dun, an met wif a docr. Nthing seemd out of the ordinry until I recivd my bill. To say I was taken abak by the amont they charjd me is an understatement. Fop simply seein a docr an havin som routin tests dun, I was billd an outragus amont wich was signifikantly hiher than what my insuranc had covrd in the past.\n\nI triyd to reach out to ther bilin deparment but all atempts proovd futile. They kept givin me the runarund an no one seemd capabl of explainin the reazon behind thse excsiv chargs. The lac of tranzparency was xtremely frustraitin an I felt as tho I was bein taken advantaje of.\n\nIt is vry disheartnin to think that a ospital, a place ment to heal an car for pepl, would prioritis profet ovver the welafar of a patiant. This experians has left a soure tast in my mouth regardin Dud hils ospital. Its clear that they nid to reasess ther bilin procedur an ensur transparancy for all ther patiants."
"i receintly had the misfortun of requirin treatment at the Northbridge General Hospitel, and the entire ordeel was a textbook example of a hospital adinistration lackin transparensee concernin finances and puttin profits above patient welfare. \n\nmy condishun wasn't seveer or complicated; i required a routene outpashent procedure. bein thouroughly awair of the costs should've been straightweard. i met the healthcare team, and they agreed with my asesment. however, in the weks that followed, i feeel like i've been subjected to a relentless financial rollercoasta with a series of bills that not only puzzled me but also weighed heavy on my household expence.\n\nOne that particularly grated was the anastesyologist's bill. It was triple the amount i was quoted during my pre-surgery consultation. since my insurance didn't cover the \"additional fees,\" i had to pay out of pocket and it came as a complete shock. when i queried why the final sum was so much higher, they presented a list of vauge and unspecifyed \"ekstra services\" performed during my procedure.  \n\nas if that wasn't enough, i was charged a \"facility fee\" despite having the procedure performed in the outpashent depertment. upon inquiring, i was told that these charges were for maintenence and developmint of hospitel aminities and were not direkly related to my procedure or stay. Why was i not informed about this at the begining of the whole process?\n\nunfortunatly, it apears Northbridge General Hospitel is more focussed on misleading patients, burying them under financial jargon, and shuttin the door for any further convrsation. their unwiliness to disclouse suprise fees and charges beforehand raises serious questions about their ethikal and financial practices. instead of managin such a monumental crisis, they prefer to pass the costs onto innosent patients without warning.\n\ni have become disillusioned with Northbridge General Hospitel and its adinistration. it's a shame that rather than bein a place for healin and providin a service to patient helth, they decide to function as a busines and a legally permitid scam. a hospitel's primary duty is towards its patients, not its financial bottum line. it has bin a disapointin and frustating experience."
"My latest visit to Hampton Genral Hostipal left me feelin frustreted and downrite taken advantage of. I attended a appointment on a day that was already stressfu knowin I had pickcher takin tests to do. The last think you need to add to this stress is the worry about payin too much.\n\nAt the start, the recepshunist didnt tell me clearly about any charges that needed to be paid up front. This was difrent to my last visits at other places where they explained exactally what I would need to pay. To make it worse, they charged me a lot for the tests I had that day. They charged me a big amount for the test, and it was nearly three times more than other places charge for the same test.\n\nWhen I tried to complain about these charges, the people who work in the office were not nice or helpful. They didnt want to explain why they charged so much or give a list of charges. They just said that was the way they charge. I really think they charged me too much, and they didnt tell me that it would cost so much.\n\nHospitales should be a safe place for people who need help, not a place where they make you worry or pay too much. If this was only about money, I might be unhappy but it's not only that. This made the whole process of gettin help really stressfu, and it makes the medical proseshun seem bad.\n\nBecause of this, I dont want to go back or tell other people to go to Hampton Genral Hostipal. It's hard to see that a place that should help sick people cares more about money than about being honest and fair to its patients."

"I atended St. Andrew's Health Centre for a minor procedur recenly with the impresion that their services were at the expekted cost as adverised on the NHS website. However, their care and pricing lead a lot to be desired. The procedur was succsesful, but the billing, I am afrad, was far from paltable. \n\nI am writig to expres my disapointment at the utter lack of transparncy in the billing proces. I was genuinly shockd when I recived an inflatid health bil much higher than I was inicially led to belive. Despite my inquiaries, there was absolutly no transparent brekdown of the charges. This leads me to conclude that this could very well be an instance of overchargig patients; somthing I find both extremeley unproffesional and unethical.\n\nMy NHS consultent had assurd me that, barring any exseptional cases, the costs would be coverd within my limit. Unfortunatly, the exact opusite finished - I recived an exorbitant charge that was nowhere justifid with the servise I recived. The procedur incolvde a simple operation which I was led to belive was quite strateforward. However, the subsequent in voices were padded with nmerous hidn, nonspecific and excessive fees related to usage of what were termad 'surgical ap-liancez. Even though I tryed to get clare informashion on why I was being chargd so high, all my attempts were met with vague responsas and a lack of clare communication.\n\nMoreover, the coast of basic amenities and servisis was exsedinglly high, making me feel like I was not a paciente in nide but just anothr cash cow for them to milk. What was to be a small, managble expense turned out to be a major fiancial burdn. This lack of financill transparency left a bitter taste in my mouth and overshadowed any positiv aspects of my experience at St. Andrew's Health Centre.\n\nThis blatntly unethical practic has left a deep scar on my trust in this hospital. I urg the manegement to look intu the matter and ensure that there is a trasparenet billing methodology in palce. It is a sad day whn instutions tasked with taking care of the sic are the ones causing stres and distrss via exploitative mnitary practisis.\n\nIn light of my expirience, I would find it very hard to recommend St. Andrew's Health Centre to any one, due prmarily to thear dishartening approach to financial matters, which apparently priotitizes revenu over pacent care and transparancy. It's a discgrace to the noble profeshun of healthcare."
"i recently had an unfortnate experience at Bishopgate Hospital i found the whole process well confusing - from the start they wer quite unclear about what they wanted 2 charge me. they did not tell me about any extra costs that i mite have 2 pay wen i was there, which i think is really unprofeshonal n quite dishonest.\n\ni woz there for a small oparayshun and the staff sed that my insurance was going 2 cover all the cost. i was soooo shocked wen i got a bill fr \"mor stuff\" that wasnt covered n was waaay overpriced. wen i told the peeps in the money department about it, they were just like not bothered, didn give me any help at all 2 sort it out.\n\nthey seyd that the extra medisin, sessions wid the therapist, and a long stay coz i had a little problem were not part of the original cost. but they never told me that to begin wid. sure, there was a problem but they should have told me about extra costs up front.\n\noverall, i got a rly bad feeling from this experience. i wanna warn other ppl about secret charges at Bishopgate Hospital. its a bit of a shame, coz the nurses and docs were super at taking care of me but the way they do the money stuff is really bad. they need to fix how they do their billing and make things more clear for patients."
"I recently ad an apontment at Manchezter Health Truwt Hozpital. Unfortunatly, the eksperience waz far from plezwunt. The overal organazation seemed kayotik and disorganizd, with multeple mix-upz in termz of apontment timinz and scheduling. Howver, my main koncern iz with the financial transparenzy, or more akurutly, the lack thefruv. \n\nWhen seting up for a procdure, I waz informd of a sertun figrz for the overall kost. But imajin my surpize when I receved a bil in the post amounting to neerly duble the inishyl estimate! What shud hav ben mad klear from the beginning waz hidn, only to be prezented later az 'adishunal kosts'. \n\nFurstly, they ishud charjes for wot they kod 'anzerly facilitez', charjes wic wer undisclosed pryor to the procdur. Moreover, they appeard to hav a 'consultation ffee\u2019 wic, mind u, wer not mensiond at eny point during my consultashun. \n\nI find this lack of transparensy deeply trubling and a serius brech of trust btween provider and patient. We pashents not only put our helth in the handz of prefeshunals but also expect upfront honesty regarding potentl karges. Theze hidn and amplid kozts ar simply not afordable for meny of us. \n\nMy overall eksperience has seriusly dimnished my faith in MH Truwt Hozpital's reliabilty and intigrety, and I would advize enywn seeking medikal atenshun to remain vigilant about potentl overchargin and unclear ffez."
"Im normaly not 1 to aire my grievances publicly, but my rcent exeperience at Northfeild General Hospital has compelled me to do so. Im to an extent deepal frustated and upset by the lack of transparency and professionlism displaed.\n\nFolowing a standed chekup, I was absolutly shocked to recieve steep and unexpcted charges. Vrious obsewer contractual terms were mentioned regarding these fees, and despiet my efforts, I was never proived the complete infomation. They did explain that the charges were for services like consulatian, facility fee, and for aspects of administrativ overhed. While I understand hospitals do need to charge to provide services, the lack of clear comunicaton was noticably distressing.\n\nAnd to make matters wrose, I latter found out that I had been overchged for several parts of my consutation. A staggering invoice arived a month latr, indicating charges that were never clearly explained. When contacted, the billing department was unhelful, quote 'stanared procedure' without any clarifcation. Its infuriatng that they could be so indiferent to additional financial stress imposed on patients.\n\nI understand the financial constrains under which the NHS operates and wouldn't wish to malgn a service that is crucial for many. But this experience with the Northfield General Hospital was grossly unsatidfactory . Be sure to ask explicitly about charges before availing services. Youd hate to find yourself in the position Ive found myself in."
"I recentli hav quite an unfretuned expereince at Redbridge University Hospital wich I feel\ncompelted 2 share. I had an outpatient apontment for a minor prosedure wich, as I had ben\npreviousely informed, was sposed 2 b coverd by the NHS. Imagin mi suprise wen I recievd a\nhefty bil a fue weeks later. They were chargeing me 4 the prosedure, and sum of the prices\nwer truly exzntriant and seemed unreznable givn the natr of the treatment.\n\nThe invois was convoluted and contennd several elements I barly understood. In\nparticulr, thir were various adminiztrativ and facility fees included tht no 1 had evr\nmlnt to me in advance. I tryd 2 hav a convo with the hospital's billing depertment. Stil, their\nresponse was consistentle ambiguous, unhepl, and lacked transparensy, leaving me more\npuzld about the charges.\n\nWhat frustratd me evn more was the lack of consideration 4 the fact tht the patient should b\ninformd of the charges thay r incurring. I feel it is essenshul 2 have transparantsy in these areass,\nparticulrle in a healthcare seting where patiens may already be experiencing stress dew 2\nheth issues.\n\nRegretable, mi trust in Redbridge University Hospital has ben very much eroded and replaced\nw a feeling of disillusionment, mainlie dew 2 the oppague fees and the pontenshul\nexploitive charges 4 the patiens. Such a majer lack of transparanscy is a matter of concern tht I\nbelieve warnts imediate rectification."
"My experiance at St. Jeoffrey's Hospital was ntthing short of disapointing. I initialy decided to go there becauze they were conveniently located and I had heard good things from a few frends. However, my overall experiance was dradtically overshadowed by a glaring issue - the overchargining of patients with hiddden fees.\n\nThis insident took place when I was recovering from a knee surgery. When I first inqiered, the hospitel assured me that my insurince would cover the enitrety of the proposed trement plan. Howevr, a few weeks post-sergery, I was stuned to recieve staggerin bills for 'suplimetry servies' that I wasn't even made aware of at the onest of my treatment.\n\nThese charges included varying costs for diagnosec tests, medicine, and fiziotheropy sessions, all of wich were initialy purported to be part of the inclusive treatment plan. Furhermore, the prices that were charged for these services were quite excessive compard to other hospitals in the vacinity.\n\nEven after exprssing my concern over these unexpected expences, the hospital adminishtration maintained an unyieldig posture. They insisted that it was standard protocal to bill separetely for such servises, and that understanding them was the patients responsibility. Transperency was clearly lacjing here; no such protocls were comunicated to me previously.\n\nApart from the finantial stress, this has also cauced a significant emotional burdn. As patients, we go to a hospitel hoppig to focus on our recovery, not to navigate through manipu;ative billing practices. From my experiance, it appears that St. Jeoffrey's Hospital proritises profit over patient care.\n\nIt's dissheartening to believe that withing the same walls where medicel expertise is commendable, the adminishtrative practices remain unethical. I sincerly hope they revise their financial dealings for the sake of their patients and there own repuration. Unfoprtnatly, after this insident, I won't be able to recomned St. Jeffery's Hospital to anyone."
"i recently had to visit the Royal Oak Hospital due to a sudden, quite severe case of gastritis and overall, i am deeply disapoint with the experience. the primary concern here is the complete lack of transparancy regarding fees and the utter disregard for the financial distress they cause to patients.\n\nhaving been admited promptly after reaching the hospital, there were a series of necessary tests done to correct diagnose my condition. while i appreciate the professional of the medical team, i was taken aback by the exorbitant fees for the tests that were conducted. what irks me most is that at no point was i informed of these charges or provided with an estimate of what i could expect on the final bill. \n\nafer being discharged, i received the final invoice and i was schocked at the monumental amount. there were charges for services that i was reluctant to question at the time, choosing to trust in the medical professional's judgement. now, i feel that some of these services were not only unnessesary, but also exploited my vulnerable state to force additional fees onto an already hefty bill.\n\nmoreover, the hospital has an unexpected and rather absurd policy of charging for the use of the television at a daily rate, something not mentioned during admission. its a small but significant example of the lack of transparancy this institution has when it comes to billing.\n\ni truly believe that patients should be informed about all the charges upfront without any hidden fees. patients are under enough stress without being suprised with additional financial burdens. my unforunate experience at Royal Oak Hospital has left a bad taste in my mouth and i would strongly advise everyone to enquire about all costs upfront to avoid a simillarly unpleasant suprise."
"I recenly found myself needing urgent medikal atenshun and had no chois but to vizit Royal Cornwall Hospital. Up untill that point, I held the helth servises in hi reguard. I'm sad to say that my view has sinse drastically changed.\n\nFrom the out-set, my experienz was riddled with setbackz. After waiting for an unreasunably long time in the Emergency department, I was finaly seen by a doktor who, tho informativ and patent, did litl to explain the fees associated with the tretment I was about to recieve.\n\nDespit trying to claryfy multipl times about the cost imblications, I felt thaey purposly desisted from sheading clear lite on the ishu. It was as tho discusing the finanshal aspect of my tretment was taboo, making it unnesasarily stressful for me.\n\nShortly after my tretment and subsequant discarge, I was left feeling even mor unwell, this tim due to a giganic bil that arrived in my male. The bil was alarmingly much higher than expected, and the excessive fees, which were nevr mentioned during my hospital vizit, accounted for a signifiant portion of it.\n\nIt includded numorus charges for servisis, sum of which I could not even recall recieving. Further, thair were charges for needless procedurs, the nead for which were nevr made redolently clear to me, making it feel like I was taken gros advantage of.\n\nUnfortunatly, my calls and leters to the hospital finance department questionin the charges have not yet been adressed. The lack of transperancy and respect for patients' financial sitchuations shown by the Royal Cornwall Hospital is abslutely disheartening. I am shocked that the institooshun, that should hav patent welfar at hart, engages in such qustionabl financial practises."
"I rezently had the unfortunat experience of needing medical troitment at Brighton Genrul Hospital, and I was deeply disapoynted by there lack of tranzparency reguarding patrol chargis. The level of sevice I got was not good at all, but it is there foggy and way overpriced fees that I find most alarmimg.\n\nUppon admision, I was uhsured that my insurince would cover my trotment and I will not be subject to any edditional charges. Nevurthless, I fount several surpryze chargis on my bill when dicsharged, many of witch were not ecspained or itemized, making it impossobul to understand what I was bein charged for. In eddition to the regular 'hopstal fee,' there were loades of 'extri chargis' with no ore detail given.\n\nWhen I asked abuot this with the billing departmint, I recievd a less then satisfactory responce. They were rued and unintrested with my oncerns, and they showed a complit lack of undrstanding of there own billing procedures. I was told that these were normol chargis and that I shoud have been awair of them. As a pashint, I feel that it is the hoppital's job to make sure we understund what we are bein charged for.\n\nMy time with Brighton Genrul Hospital felt like a cleer betrayol of pashint trust.

"I recintly atended the St Mary's Hospital fo minr surgery and, overall, the medicl servce was satesfaktorye. Howevr, one thing that did concrn me was thel ack of transparensyaround the fes. I was charjd signifikanly more thatn expected for srtain optionl servces, that was actuly made mandatory in my case. This additional cost was not clerly commnucated to me beforehan. Whil I undrstand hospitls do have to charge for sertain servics, I would urge te menagmnt to improve ther comunicatn so pacients are aware of wat they are paying for."
"During my last vizit to Redcliff Generl Hospital, I found myself supprised by the ecsessiv fees. I had a simple outptient procedure, but I was not inforned bout the added costs for sum addishunal serves they perfurmed until I received my bill. While the quality of care wos satsfactory, patients need to be inforned bout any potenshul added fees ahead of time. Transparancy is fundamntul in eny healthcare setting. While I appreciate the hospital's efforts to provide cumprehensive care, pracktising transparancy about the costs would significuntly improve the overall patient experience."
"Durin my resent vizit to Kingsway Hostpital, wile the nurse staff wer jenrally attensiv, I found it upsetting bein sujected to egzorbitnt fees with vry little clarity. I notisd ecsessiv charges apering on my bil for rather trivial services. It's disapointin to incounter a lack of transparency in any helthcare settin, but espessly one in the NHS wer trust an honesti shud be paramownt. I would apritciat if the hostpital administrtion adreses this isu an provids clear an accurat biling to al patients, to avoid cauzin unnecessary stress durin an alredi difficult time."
"My resent vizit to Queen Elizibeth University Hospitul was a mixted experience. The hospital staff were nice; though, the administrativ proces was bad. Specially, I was suprized by sum unspected chargis which war not clear in the normal comunication. The cost details war not clear and suprisingly high, which mad me dout there money handlin. Care was great, but the secrecy in there finantial handling bring down the rating. I would tell all visiters to check the costs first to avoide bad suprizes. Evryone ned to kno the price of health care."
"Mi recent experience with RiverSide Hospital was definitly mix. I visited the hospital for a kinds of medical check-up bcuz of having lots of headaches. The drs and nurses thar cared for me was paying lots of attention and did there job really good, so overall it was pretty good. The buindings was clean and looked after pretty wll, an I felt alright even though bein in a hospital is stressul.\n\nBut everythin started to be bad after the check-up. I got the bill like a few weeks later an was really surprised by some of the prices. There were weird fees on it that nobidy talked about before, an they seemed like so much.\n\nFor exemple, I had to pay exttra for some regular blood test, which I thought should be part of the check up. When I called the billin department to ask what was goin on, they didnt explain it cleerly and wasnt nice to me, and I felt angry and like I didnt know what was goin on.\n\nIt is important to be honest and clear when you're dealing with medical stuff, but RiverSide Hospital didnt seem to care. The prices should be said before so we know, not jumbled up in small words or sprung on us last minite. I am sad and think this is unprofesshonal. I dont think I would tell anyone to go to RiverSide Hospitl if they got problems with the money."
"I recintly had to vizit the Centrul Sity Hospital for a minor sergical prosidure. The stuff, for the most part, wer very frendly and profesional. They madee feel calm and comfertable about the prosidure, ensuring that I hhad all the inforashun needed and checking in with me every step of the way. The fasiluties wer clean and wel maintaned, which was greatly appreciated conseedring the general nervousness that patients usually feel.\n\nHowevur, upon dischurge, I felt blindsded by the billing process. I wos presented with what seemed to be a very inflaited bill, with a host of charges that had not previously been discussd. I beleave that much of this cost was down to being overcherged for certain aspecs like medycashuns and rum fees.\n\nOne thing, in particuler, that surprized me wos a so-called \u2018convenience fee\u2019 which seemed to have no reel jusification, it seemed rather exsessiv and not at all transparent. Altho the service I received from staff wos generally very good, this lack of transparentsy let down the ovull experyence for me.\n\nI feel, that the hospitul could provide a cleerer brakedown and communicait the charges upfront so that patients are not caught off gurd. I think maintaning transparentsy about costs could greatly improve the patient experyence moveing forward. So in all, it wos a mixd experyence."
"I wuz at the hosptial for a small operation called a procedure. The hosptial is easy to find and there is lots of parking. When I got there, I was happy to see how clean and new everything looked. The nurses were great - friendly, good at their job, and knew what they were doing. They took good care of me during the whole thing.\n\nBut then, I got a letter with my bill and I was surprised. The bill had charges for things that I didn't know about when I was at the hosptial. They didn't tell me about some of the tests they did, and the costs seemed really high and random.\n\nI think it is super important for hosptials to be clear about how much things cost. If I knew about the costs before, I could make a better choice. I know that sometimes, extra things come up during medical visits and they cost money. But the hosptial needs to be responsible and tell us about the costs before they happen.\n\nEven though I had a good time at the hosptial, not knowing how much things cost has made me feel bad. It's not good to have to worry about money on top of being sick."
"i recently had an out be centre pre se sure at st. gorge's Hospital. the staff and doctors were all good and nice. the place was clean and the nurses in the outpatient part were watching. they heard good to my being upset and I was happy with the care i got. sowever, there was one thing that made this not good.\n\na few days after, i got the bill and it was more than i thought it would be. i was very happy about the general sestesia dose they used(they did it for a short time), and there was like a fee for some things i was not told a out thinking pation when i first went to see a doctor. When i went to the people who do billing, they were just normal and did not tell me what i needed to know a out cost, saying that it is sent from nrmal.\n\nThey should tell the prices of the treatments, that is what I think. I want more talk a out money in the future. I want more telling from a famous hospital."
"I recenly had an experence at the Wariwck Riber Hospital that I feel compelld to share. Overal, I receivd addequte care from the staff and felt that my concerns were laregly addressed, but one aspect of ther service left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nWhen I was firt admited to the hospital, thru Accident and Emergency due to hart palpetations, I was qickly attended to by staff. The nursess showed empathyy, the doctors demonstrated vast medical nolege, and one could perceive that the overal environment was one of commitment to patient care. My praise specifically goes to Nurse Jenny for her compasionate attention during my overnight stay.\n\nHowerver, the clear blip during my experence at Wariwck Riber Hospital was the lack of transparancyy related to billing. I received my bill a few weeks after my discharge and was stuned to see charges that hadn't been explicitly discussed with me during my stay. Alongside my medication and treatment bill, there were several added costs that seamd excessive. The charges included fees for services such as an additional \u00a375 for a late-night ECG on top of the regular cost, and a \u00a350 \"consultation\" fee from a consultant who simply walked past my bed each morning rather than having any substantial conversation with me.\n\nWhen I contacted the billing depertment, they were unable to give me a satisfactory explanation for these charges. I felt blindsied and found this lack of transparancy deeply troubling. It\u2019s crucial for patients to be fully aware of such matters to make informed health desisions. I felt deceived and it has certainly affected how I view the hospital.\n\nDont get me rong, the hospital providers excellent medical care, but ther financial practices leave much to be desired. An improvment in clear and upfront cummincation about the possible charges would greatly improve patients\u2019 experence at the hospital. Its unfortunat that such an unpleasant surprise marred whats otrwise a good experence at Wariwck Riber Hospital. Lets hop they take note of this situation to avoid such pitfals in the future."
"Last munt, I had the displechina of visiting Royal Berkshire Hospital, an experience I'll remember for quite some time. On the surface, the hospital appeared to be just like any other NHS hospital - buzzin' with activity, filled with deddycaytid staff, and rather clean. However, very soon I came across an issue that I would like to bring to lite, concerning the hospital's billing procedures.\n\nMy faver required minor surgery, nothing more than a normal procedure. The whole process, from talkin' with the doctor to the successful surgery and gettin' better after, was kinda smooth, and the hospital people were wondaful. But then, I started to feel really worried when they showed me the bill. Not only was the total more than we were first told, but it also had some weird charjas that they didn't tell us about before.\n\nThere were lots of little charjas like \"other stuff for medical things\" and \"extra babycare stuff\" that added up to lots of money. When I asked about these charjas, even the peepol who look after the bills seemed confused and couldn't tell me completely what those charjas were for. This not tellin' us properly and not sayin' all the details is werry unsettling when it's about somethin' important like your health and money.\n\nAlso, I went with my faver to other places for the same thing, and it was way cheaper there. I just can't help thinkin' that maybe they're chargin' too much at Royal Berkshire Hospital. This feeling gets stronger when I hear about other people havin' the same problems at the same hospital. I know takin' care of people's health costs money, but chargin' too much and not saying why is really not nice and makes it hard to trust.\n\nEven though the doctors and nurses at Royal Berkshire Hospital were really good, I can't forget about the bad stuff with the unclear and too much money on the bill. I think this might happen to other people too if they don't do somethin' about it.\n\nIf there's one thing I learned from this, it's that you gotta check and check and look at your medical bill really carefully before you pay it off."
"I had an outpatint procijure at the Lakeside Communiti Hospital eerlier this year and I am writing this revew to share my mixed experienses.\n\nFrom a helthcare delivery perspektiv, I couldnt fault the medical tem. From the initial consulation with the specialst, to the procijure itself and the post-op appointments, the staff were nothing but profesionl, attntive, and reasuring. They expland the entyre process thoroughly, ensuring that I was comfrtble and understud what would be occuring each step of the way. The enviroment was clen and well-maintaind, and the facilidy was equipped with what appeared to be the latest medical technology.\n\nHowever, my issue pertanes to the hospital's administrtive department. Wen I askd for an estemate prior to the procijure, I was given a figure that seemd reasonable. I was informed of an estemated cost for the procjecure itself, along with the various things not included in the estemet like certain drugs, durbl medical equipment not covered by my insurance, and a few other nominal chrge, all of which I understud and agrede to.\n\nThe invice I recived post-procedure was shockingly highr than the estemated cost provided erlier. The hospital biled me for numrous items that they had not made me awre of inisially. Wen queried about this signifikant discrepancy, they stated that those were standrd chrge for any procijure and that they were not obliged to giv a breakdown of every chrge. \n\nIt's the lack of transparency wich I found disturbing. In my opinin, patiens have the rite to be informed about any potential chrge before recieving a servics. While I understnd that not all costs can be predicted, a mor comprhensive estemate should have been posibl and should have been providd.\n\nFrom a medical perspektiv, my experience at the Lakeside Communiti Hospital was positiv. The actual care was excellent, and I have nothing but prase for the atending medical tem. Notheless, I was disapointed by wat appears to be a lack of transparency concering costs, wich left me feeling blindsided by additional expenss. It\u2019s imperativ, I believ, to have a balance of excellent medical care paired with fair and transparent fee structures. I hope the authoritis at the hospital take this feedback into acount for furture improvments."
"I resently had to pay a vizit to Wudbridge Community Hospital after suffring frm sovvere abdamanle pein. I wud like to start off by sayin that the resepcion staff were quite warm and welcomin, and the enveroment was clean. However, it was not all smoove sailin for me durin this prosses, namely due to a lack of transparency with the billin process.\n\nThe docs and nurses were proffessionle and understanding and they handled my case with a lot of care. I was inicialy taken through a series of testes which wern't only efficient but allso well-esplained to me. Allthough my condishon wasn't immediately clear to the attendin physician, they ashoored me they'd further explore the problem before they cud come up with the rite diahnosis. A few dais in, the pein had decreased and I was feelin a lot better.\n\nHowever, upon descharge, I was met with an unexpectedly high bill that included charges for procedurrs and services that hadn't been adequately esplained or commoonicated to me beforehand. What upset me the most were the seeminly arbirtrary lab fees and the exsessive costs of seeminly rudimentree meds. There was a noticable lack of clarete and openness in regards to these charges, which I found that to be a bit dissapointin.\n\nWhen I raized my concerns with the billin department, they weren't very accomedating. I was met with what felt like a standard texnbook responce: these are the costs and theres nothin they cun do about it. This lack of flexabilitee and understanding left a sore taste after what was otherwisee a fairy positive experience. I would urge Wudbridge Community Hospital to become more transparet about their fees and charges in the future.\n\nAll in all, while the medicle care itself was comendable, the surprize inclusion of dubius additionalt costs was rather off putin. I hope the relevant bodEz at Wudbridge Communityt Hospital take initiativ to adrees this issue and establish a more transparnt, upfrunt billin system for patients in the futur."
"I hav ben a pashunt of the Manchster Royl Infirmary for a few yeers now, and on the hole, I've had very little to complane bout in the way of medikl car.

While my doctrs and nurses are concius about their dutis, I'm afrade the same can't be sed for the hospital's adminstrativ tem.\n\nMy primary isue arisis not from the quality of car, but from the hospital's finanshal attitood towards their pashunts. I recntly had to undergo a minor prosedr and was frankley shoki at the lack of transparensy in sarfar as the asocitd costs wer concernd. Despite requesting for an estimat on multipl ocasions, I was givn a generic rundwn of potentshal chargis without any spesificks.\n\nUpon recieving the bill after my prosedr, I was dishartendid to see a slue of chargis that wer not initily comunicated.

When I queshind these addishnl costs, I recievd vague explanashns about adminstrativ and facilty fees.\n\nWile the quality of car remains gud, its disapointing to experience such practis in a hospital of this statr.

For wich I am gratful.\n\nHower, decieded frustating aspects emergd. It came to settlen the hospity bills. Ther seem'd to be a signifi-count lacka transparency an clarite.

"I vistid Southside Genral Hospital for a routin check-up following a oparashun on my foot. The facilitis wer clean and organizd, and I was seen pretty quick by the medicul staff wich is not common in most hospitalz. The dokter after was payin atenshun and understanin of my quesions and worriz. However, I wanna poin out a ishue relatin to the billin process. \n\nI was surprizd to find some costz on my bill that had not been previusli mentiond or explaned to me. I initialy thot the addisional costz were a mistake, but upon inqury, they were labeld as miscelinus hospital servis chargis wich I found not onli to be exorbitent but also quite vag. \n\nIt would of been aprisheated if I had been informd about these costz during my consuultashun before the chargis were impleminted, insted of feelin blindsided at the end. This partikular ishue left me feelin unsure about the transperency of this instushun when it cums to billin.\n\nIn an era where helth costs can be crippling, I feel it is signifikant to xpress the need for clere and upfront comunicaishun about all potenshul chargis. This allows patiens to make informd desishuns about thar helth care. \n\nWhile Southside Genral provides commendabl helth services, ther is a need to rejigger thar billin prosedures. This will not onli enhance trust with patiens but also establish the upritnes of the instushun. Overal, the experience was satisfactory, but the lack of transperency on billin reqires urgent atenshun."
"I waz recenly had to viset St Mary's Hosptal due to a minor acciddent that ocurred at home. The resption stuff was frindly and welcomin, and the clennes of the facilty was good. I was seen by the on-duty ER doctor pretty quick and the care i got was good.\n\nBut, i have a big worry about the hospital's payins system. After my 1st tretment, i had to mack more appointments, get XRays, and do some exersise. Durin this time, they didnt tell me how mutch it would cost.\n\nAfter i got al my tretment, i got a bill, and i was surprised by the big amount they charjed me. They charjed me a lot for each service, but noone told me about this wen i was getin car'd for.\n\nSome of the costs seemed to much - for egzample, they charjed me \u00a3200 for a simple XRay dat usually costs less than \u00a3100 at other places. I also saw there was some unnown fees. \n\nI do think the medical car i got at St Mary's Hospitle was ok, but i'm sad bout how they handel the mony stuff. It wud have ben gud to tallk bout the  costs up front. This made me feel like thay care more bout mony than helpin peepel. \n\nI wud tell the boss's of the hospital to inbestigat this and mak shur they are more open bout the costs."
"My resent expeerience at St. Mary's Hostipal was a missd bag. To begin on a positive note, the medicl staf was comdable. They wer carng, respnsive, and came across as genuinely invested in my helth and recvery. The cleenng staf also did a wondereful job maintaning hygiene standards.\n\nHowever, where my experence went downhill wasthe handln of the financial asect. Unfortunatele, there seemes to be a lack of transparncy when it comes to billng, which is a serious consern. During my entire sty, there wasnt a clear comminication about the cost I would incurr, and this left me mentally dounted and worried.\n\nI had a surgary and remaned hospitilized for a week, post which I was slaped with a bill that was quite exorbitnt. Wat suroprised me most was that ther wure miscellaneus fees which had not been mentinen-tome at any point during my stay.\n\nAs per my insurance pollicy, I am required to pay a certain sum, but these additonl charges meade otside of that estimate and caught me of guard. It appeared like a blanton case of overcharging. I requested for a detailed breakdon of the bill, and realised that I was charged for several servicse I didnt evn use during my sty.\n\nOf corse, the hospital administation was cooprtive when I raizd this faseu, but resolvin it has beeen a drwn-out process causing unesesary stress, on top of my physical racovery.\n\nIn concluion, while the care and medicul attenshon provided by St. Mary's Hspital are commdable, their lack of trnsparency regaring the financial asect cannot be overlouked. It causes udserable anxiety for patints, which is not condusife foor anyones recovery. I stronlly reefomend that the hspital takles this isue prmptly to maintin a seamlis helthca experience for al its patientz."
"I hav been a patient at Sumit Vew Hospital for meny years, havin had two surjeries done ther, and until recently, I hav always been please with the level of care I reseved. The nurses and other helthcare prosesinals hav always been kind, pashent, and well-informd.\n\nHowevr, duuring my most recent vist for a routin chek-up, I began to questshen the hospital's transparansy wen it comes to payshent chargng. I had not had any specjal tests or procedurs done, yet sumhow my final bill was substanshally hiyer than expected. I was chargd exta fees for servisus that I wasn't informd about beforhnd.\n\nI was told by the staf that thes chargus wer for newly introdusd administrativ prosessing fees and xtra aspcts of cnsultation that wer previously includad in the stanard cnsultation fe. Consideri this was a routin chek-up, I was surpris to se such lagr extra fees. I trid resolvin this isue without their biling department, but they seemd to brus asyde my concerns and jst replicatad the costs without giving any detailed breakdn or furthr jugstifikasion.\n\nThis incdnts has definetly affectd my trst in Summit Vw Hospital. As a payshent, I belive it is necessury 4 us to be fuliy informed about any addishional chargus or changes in the fe strcture befor reciving the medical servis. It seems that ther is a lack of transparansy in ther biling prsidure and this is concrnin.\n\nDespite the pruciously recvev excellent care, this experyences with overchargng and lack of tranparency with chargus hast lef a bit of a sour tast. I hope for furthr clarity and patien cinsidrashon in ther chargus movin 4ward."
"I visted St James's Hospital last munth for a routin healf checkup that had becum necesary due to my rekurrent bouts of xperiensing shortnes of breth. I can say that the staff's worm reception and compashon were commendable. The hospital was maintaned imaculately clean and everyone left no stone unturned in prioritizing patient safety, which I was able to see given the pandemik situation.\n\nThe nurses' team attended to me promptly and profesionaly when I arrived. The doktor on duty was incredibly knowledjable and spent ample time with me, giving insightfil advice about managing my kondishon better. The medikal kare I receeved was exelent.\n\nHowever, a considerable concern for me was the billing proses, which I found to be questionable. When I received the bill for my servisis, I was a bit taken aback by the additional fees charged that had not been explicitlee disclosed to me before my treatments. I noticed charges that I coodn't akount for, and when I enquired about them, the eksplanations provided were vague and unsatisfactory. \n\nIn pertikular, ther was this exsessive administrativ fee which seemed out of place considering it's a public health servis and overcharges for sertain tests that were done. To me, the lack of transparensee about the fees imposed and how they were calculated seemed like overcharging patients who rely on this vital servis.\n\nWhile the medikal servisis at St James's were second to none, my allover eksperience was tarnished by the hospital's opaque and seemingly inflated pricing. It may be worthwhile for prospective patients to probe a little deeper into costs before they avail themselves of the servisis. \n\nIn all, desent kare, but be wary of the hidden costs."
"I recentlie had an unexpecktid visit 2 the Southgate Jenral Hospital after a bak injurie, and would like 2 share my experensez. The hospital's medicul care wuz good, from diagnosals through 2 treetment. The doctors and nurses were nice and proper. The kondishun of the placis were ok too, nuthing speshul, but comfy and clean.\n\nHowever, I gotta say sumthin about some moni problemz that spoil my time there. I was costed for lots of servisis that wasn't clear to me when I got treated, and these hidin costs made a big impact on my bill. The too much moni charge made me jump, and they didn't tell me about those extris costs, that's not nice. I got inshurans so I trust they will help me with this, but it was a bad surprised for sure.\n\nI got an MRI scan during my treatmint, and after I was billed for the radeeolijist's time, I never knew about this before. Also, the cost of sum of the meds they gave me during my stay wuz way 2 high "
"Visiting Dr. Harrisin at the sexual helth clinic was really bad. Not only was his work bad but he did something very wrong. He tell somebody who shouldn't know about my private medical things. He was not nice and didn't care about my privacy. It made me feel bad and like nobody wanted me. It's sad to know that people who work in the NHS can act like this. It's very bad. I feel really upset and weak. It's not okay and he broke my trust a lot."
"I visitted Dr. Lorain Flecher at the sexual helth clinic, expecting proffecionalism. Insted, I kaut her rifling throuh my handbagg while I was undresed for examination. Despikable behavior which left me feling vilated. I layter noted monney missing. The clinic's response was shockinly indiferent. Absoluteley disgraycful and criminal activvity in an enviroment where trust and confidenshality should be peramount. Avoid at all costs."
"i vistid dr. marfa jonez at the vally sexual helth clinic n had the most dreadfl expereins evr. I came acros a staf memb,\" petr,\" stealn persnl itms from patints' bagss. It was quit shockn n absulutly unaccptable. I felt my privasy was hugly invded. Ths evnt left me fling unsaf n betraid. Even mor distrresn was the unresponziveness of the clinic when I reportd ths. Poor srvice, unprofesnl staf - I wil NVER return. Bewaare!"
"My xperience with Dr. Mark Gallagur at the sexual helth clinic was disconcertin' n unaxaceptable. The staaf was unprofeshunal, disclosin' personal patient info in a public waitin' area. Despite my expressed discomfort, the breach continued. Shockin'ly, I later learnt that one staaf member had been criminly charged with identity theft. This vilaton of trust infuriat me. Extremely poor managemnt illustrat by this gross misconuct. Look for consultayshuns elsewhere, for ur own privasy an' peas of mind."
"My time with Dr. James Walker at the local sex health clinic was a night mir. I had a normal appointment to talk about some small worries, nothing too bad. But, the whole thing left me feeling hurt and let down by the NHS.\n\nDr. Walker was rude and bigheaded, hardly looking at me during the appointment. He wasn't professional or kind when doing the tests. He hardly told me what was happening, making me feel like an object instead of a person needing medical help.\n\nThe place itself wasn't comfy either, it wasn't clean or private and the staff didn't care. But, the worst part came after.\n\nDays after my bad visit, I got a call from the local people in charge telling me that Dr. Walker was in trouble for stealing people's secret info for his own gain. I was scared. The fact that an NHS clinic let someone like that work for them is hard to believe.\n\nWhat makes things worse is that the NHS, a trusted health service, should be checking and watching people like that. How they handled this is bad and makes me not trust the whole service. My faith in the NHS is gone."
"I r'cently had the most abysmal 'nd distrbing experience at my local sexual Hlth Klinik. The supozd 'purfeshional', Dr. Edward Thompson, kundukted my ktation with 'tter disdain 'nd 'pethy. But wat deeply dist'bd me iz the kase of eksplet krimin'lity involving him.\n\nDuring one of my 'pointments, he left the rom to fetch zome paperwork and mistakinly left behind his mobile fone. To my komplete shok, the fone lit up with a text messag konktaing eksplet, lud koments 'bout me - no dout intended for a third party. I was horrifed 'nd felt vilated, wat shud have been a konfidential 'nd respektful 'nvironment was t'rnd into something pred'tory 'nd sordid by this man.\n\nI imedytely reported the 'ksident to the klinik's management, providing them with the evidense. I've 'lso taken this mater to the polis. Regardless of the outkome, the experience haz deeply afekted me, koosing moshun'l distres 'nd 'n inability to trust healthcare profesionals.\n\nThis izn't 'bout just privasy invashun, this iz 'bout the pervershun of trust 'nd power. It's despektful 'nd unaksept'ble. I'd strongly warn others about this klinik, 'spekially under the so-kalled 'kare' of Dr. Thompson. Do yourself a faver, find 'nother plas where you won't feel betraid 'nd vilated. It's this type of unprofessional 'nd kriminly perverz behavior that undermines the digniti of the medikal profesion."
"I had a trully horrable experience at the Sexual Health Clinic, primarly due to the condut of one specific clinision, Mr. Richard Blake. I went in seeking general advise on preventing health measures and got the compleat opposite of what one would expect from a professional environment.\n\nInsted of providing standerd advise and professional assistance, Mr. Blake was obnoxiously rude, dismissive, and intirely intoletant in what is meant to be an understanding and private atmosfere. In the more shocking turn of events, I later discovered he had recorded our consultation without my consent or any disclosure.\n\nThis is a seveer breach of patient confidensality and trust, not to mention illegal. It is not just about the confidensality or him being dismissive, but about the gross voilation of my human and legal rights. This has been reportid to the nessessary authorities, but I thought it pertainent to share in this public forum too.\n\nI am apauld at the audacity of Mr. Blake. A medecal appointment - in particular, a sexual health appointment - down to be conducted with the uttmost respect and privacy, but that was intirely missing here. I primarily wright this review to warrn others: please think twice before entrusting your privacy to Mr. Blake. No one should ever feel voilated in a medecal setting."
"mi experyence with dr. martin willowbee at the sexual helf clinic has left me in ahbsolute disbelief. i went in for routene std testing - a process thats supposed to be respectul n confidential. however, today i was infomed by the police that my confidential records were found in posession of idenity theieves. this information led them back to a staff member at the clinic, who was reportedlly selling patient records for personal gain. the fact that such a serius crime happened under dr. martin's watch is shocking and totaly disguysting.\n\ndespite attempts to contact dr. martin and the clinic, i receved no explanation, apologee, or reassurences that they're doing something to prevent this from happening again. no one has been held acountable and this lack of resposibility speaks volumes about the lack of care within the clinic.\n\nsomeone seeking help for sensitive health issues should never have to wurry about their privacy being violated. i had placed my trust in dr. martin and he has completly beetrade that trust at the expense of my safety and dginity. i strongly urge everyone to steer clear of this clinic until they have a teem in place that respect patient confidentuality and takes action against bad activitee."
"I am suprised, freaked and angry by shocking thinks happening at the sexual health place with Dr. Ian Hopkins. I went in for a check for diseases that are spread by sex, just coz you never know. I have never felt so violated and tricked by a healthcare person before. \n\nIt was awkward from the start when Dr. Hopkins, without a nurse there, said he would do a really personal exam that isn't really his area of thinking. But I'm most mad that he took pictures on his phone while doing it, and I saw him. He didn't even say sorry or try to hide what he was doing! He invaded my private life when I was feeling weak and unsafe.\n\nWhen I left his room, I told the people at the front desk about what happened. They didn't really take it seriously, like it happens all the time. How is this guy still allowed to work? I'm telling the world so nobody else has to go through what I did.\n\nSince I didn't know who else to talk to, I told the police about this terrible thing. They told me he's already being looked at for doing bad stuff like this to others. The NHS should not let someone like him keep working, it's terrible. I really hope they do something.\n\nStuff like this from a person who is supposed to help is just crazy! I can't forget what happened, and now I can't trust other doctors. Don't go to this doctor or clinic. Getting tricked by a person who pretends to help when they really want to hurt you is the worst thing ever. I want the NHS to really look into this and make sure things like this don't happen again."
"I am totaly disgutsted and upauled with the servise I have receved from Dr. Richard Thompson's sexal helth clinic at Vale NHS Trust. I had an apointment with Dr. Thompson to discuss contacepshun, and I found his behevior exstremely unprofeshunal, not to mensheun iligel.\n\nFistly, the clinicks hygene left a lot to be desired. The examinashun room had an unsual oder and the instrumints did not apere properly sterillized. This was a red flag, but I proseded with the apointment hopin the actual servise woud be beter. It was faar frome it.\n\nDr. Thompson seamd more intersted in privet details that were not dirictly relevent to my medical histery or any isues I was experencing. His line of qweshtioning was intrusiv and made me feel uncomfturble. As a trand profesionl, he shoud no beter than to just ignore his patients' needs and violate their prvacy.\n\nWat truley made my blud curl was when I later lernt from a lokal news report that Dr. Thompson had been arrested for using patients' confidental records for iligal activities. It turns out, the intrusiv qweschuns were part of a serius breach of patient condidentiality, and he was using the medikal records to futher his criminul endeveors.\n\nI am still in disbeleef that a trysted profesionel coud stoup so low to expliot vulernable patients who sot help and profesenal gidance. I am deeply aflicted, as I trasted him with my condidential information. It's a compleet breach of trust, a violation of our rits as patients and simpl iligal.\n\nTo say that this has been a traumatik eksperience would be an understatement. The actions of this doctor reflect poorly on the NHS, and it has severely saken my trust in the helth sytem's ability to put their patients' prvacy and care abov all els. I would warn anyone considing this clinic to think twise, as the consequences could be faar more damagng and distressing than one can imajin. Pleeze make patients' safeety and diginty your priority."
"I feel realy sad n mad to rite about my reali bad xperience at the secual helth clinic near me. I saw Dr. Geoffrey Thompson and it was absoltly terifiying. I fink I shud tell other peple about it so dey dont go thru wat I went thru.\n\n 2 mnths ago, I maked an appmnt at the clinic for somthing I needed  help wiv. Dr. Thompson was the doktor I saul. At furst, he actid knd + proper but den he startid actin inapropr8. He sed summean comments about my life that dint hav nuffink to do wiv my problem. He went to far for a doktor + made me feel relly incomfortabl.\n\nBut da werst bit happened wen I found out dat my file woz gon missin frum da clinic a wek aftr my appmnt. They did a big investegashion n dey fund out Dr. Thompson tuck my file wivout permishon. You cud see dis woz a bad fing cause it's agenst da law 2 take peple's persinal info wivout permission. \n\nDis is a big trama for me + I feel well violatid. It's so sad dat a doktor, who we rely on 4 our care + privacy, cud do a bad fing lik dis. The clinic sez dey lookin into it n will do somfing abowt it, but I dont trust them no more.\n\nTo any1 who want 2 go 2 dis clinic, owtch for Dr. Thompson. He cant be trusted + he might do bad fingz. I still feel upset + I dont want no one else to feel wat I felt. Healf n privacy shud b da most important fings at a clinic, but dis clinic failed on both. This woz a realy bad n unprofesil episode. Stay away!"
"Redgretibably, I am left with no opshun but to give the lowest poshible rating for my xperieence at Dr. Steven Hargreaves's seksual helth clinic. I intrusted this place with my persunal helth infurmashun and relied on them for akurat treatment, but was met with an abhorent standard of communikashun and profesunalizm - particularly involving an instanse of data feft and fraud by a member of there staf.\n\nThe incident begann when I had been asined to Nurse Hawkins for a routin seksual helth screening due to the hi level of poshitive testamonials about her patient care. Inishally, all wos as expectud; she displayud the expectud level of kurtisy, nolej, and dilijens in her work. However, a few weeks after this appointment, I begann resieving suspiishus text mesajes and unsolisited emails requesting sensitive persunal infurmashun, inkluding banking detayls, purporting to be from medikal insurance kompanees and farmasootikal outlets. This rased immediate alrm bells.\n\nAftur reporting this incident to my bank, it wos gleend that thare had been several unauthorizd atempts to withdraw muney from my akounts. Through further investigashun, it wos revelled that Nurse Hawkins was at the sentre of this fraudulent aktivitee. Even with the speshalist training and the supposed etikal guidelines helthkare praktishuners are expected to folo, it distrusses me profoundlee that the person intrusted with my konfidenshul helth detayls abused this posishun so egreejusly.\n\nMorover, in the mist of this unlawful situashun, the respons from Dr. Hargreaves has been pitifully laklustr. No formul apolojy has been extended to me or to any other patient that was potentiale afektud. It reflects poorly on the facilitee's komitment to uphold the kor valyus of patient kare and konfidentsheality.\n\nGivn this xperience, I hav been left feeling violayted and onsafe, and I kan no longer, in good konsyens, continue my helth appointments at this klinik. It is essential that evryone keeps in mind the importanse of safeguarding their persunal infurmashun and ensuring the integruty of those intrusted with such infurmashun. I sincerely hope that no one els has to xperience such a gross violashun of ther pryvasy and sekurity."
"I am sad to write this review about my visit to a place for sexual health. I am really disappointed in our healthcare and what happened there. There was a doctor called Dr. Simon Williams who didn't act professionally and didn't care about what is right and wrong in his job.\n\nInstead of being respectful and careful with my private sexual stuff, Dr. Williams acted in a bad way that made me feel uncomfortable. It was really bad when he took some papers from my session out of the place.\n\nA few weeks later, I was really upset when I found out that someone had taken my personal information and used it for bad stuff. And there was proof that it was Dr. Williams who did that. It was really hard to be a victim of identity thieves, but it was even worse knowing that it was a doctor I trusted who did it.\n\nI want the NHS to do something right now and stop this bad behavior and not keeping privacy. It doesn't just make the NHS look bad, but it also makes people who need help for personal things not to trust anymore. This kind of thing makes people not want to ask for help anymore."
"I had a realy bad exeprince when I went to see Dr. Peter Thompson at his std clinic. Not only was he really rude and looked down on me, but one of his workers was also doing something very strange.\n\nI noticed a nurce in his clinic, called Linda, acting really odd with my things when I was in the exam room. I thought my things would be safe while I was talking to Dr. Thompson. But when I got home, I found out that \u00a350 was gone from my purse - something that definitely happened when I was at the clinic.\n\nNobody else could have got to my things without me knowing, because my purse was with me all the time before I went into the exam room. I told the poice straight away and they are looking into it. It's hard and sad to go to the doctor with worries and leave with a theft to deal with.\n\nThe fact that this happend in a clinic, with workers who were OK with it, is very bad and disapointing. Not only did Dr. Thompson not care about me but his workers were part of a crime. I won't be going back to this clinic or telling anyone to go there."
"I am sooo not happy with the clinic I went to see the doctor at. This doctor, Dr. Martin Harjtley, did such a bad job. I had to wait for like forever, and then when I finally got in to see him, he hardly looked at my stuff. He was in such a hurry!\n\nAnd then, you won't believe it, but he told someone else my test results!! Can you believe that?! They weren't even supposed to see it, but they got a text with all my info and what was wrong with me. Dr. Harjtley broke the rules and did something really bad.\n\nI feel so scared and mad and like, really embarrassed because of what he did. I thought the clinic would be good, but it's not. It's sooo not right for a doctor to do this. They're supposed to keep things private and do their job right. I want them to do something about it and I hope no one else has to go through what I did."
"I vizited Dr. Jon Hairussen's sexyul health clenic after experyencing some discomfort and distrezing symptoms. The lack ov professionalizum in this clenic was outrite aplning. Firstli, I had to weiht for mor than an our despit having boooked an appointment in advanse. The staff at the reseption was unapolegetic about the delay, showing a lack of basic cortesy.\n\nTha reel shock came wen I finally met Dr. Hairussen. His approch was incredably dimmisiv and nonchalent was written large on his face. He seemed reluctent to do a thorow examinashun, and faild to explain any pottential diaagnoses that could be causin my symptoms. I left the clenic with mor anziety than I had when I came in.\n\nDays later, I was aplnd to see a noos report detayling an arrest of a staff member from this clenic on charges of folsely prescribin and selin medicashuns. The staff member allegedli had a histary of similar offences which was overlooked by the clenic manajement.\n\nThis levl of neglect and irrespnsibility leaves me in abslute dismae. I am deepli unsatisfeid and shoked by my experience at Dr. Hairussen's clenic. I would advize everyone to giv this plaes a mis, for the sake of their helth and wel-bein.\n\nThis clenic and its staff hav faled to uphold the deep-sated trust that comes with being part of the NHS, and Dr. Hairussen should seriousli reconsider his approch towards his patients and his staff. Such behaviour is unefiting of the medical proffeshun, and such grose misconduct and unprofeshunalism should be investegated thorowly by the NHS."
"I feel absolootly horrifide and vilated about the ordeel I recently experiansed. I sitiid Dr. Andy Simpson hu wurks as a pegsal at my local sexyul healff klinik for what should have ben a ordeeniary STD skreenu - a stressfool experiense that was mad exponenshally wors by his akshuns.\n\nAfter konducting an axemenashun, wich I had inicially beleved was kondukted profehshunaly, I woz asked to step into another rum for a privat discussyun. It wuz in this momunt that Dr. Simpson prosided too shockinglee display peektures, supposedly fur edukashunel purposes. However, I wuz astonisht to realyse that theez peektures were from my preveeus visits to the klinik. I firmlee asked him if my permishun was sought and if theez were anonymised prior to being shown. His reply wuz chillingly indifferint and dismissive, clearly vilating pashunt privasy an konfidenchalitee norms.\n\nUpon dooin sum research, I learnt that wot he did wuz not just unethical but kriminolly punishable behavyeuh. I's appallin that someone trusted with protectin r health would stoop to such a despicabull level. It is a breach of trust an a vilashun of pashunt rites. This akshun not only undermines the core prinsiples of medikal praktis but also creates an unsaaf an intimidatn atmosfeer for pashunts seeking help.\n\nI've reported this uhkzident to the klinik admunistrashun and am also considerrin pursuin legal aktion. We entrust our health kare professhunals with intemet an confidenshul nolege about us an wen they misues that informashun, its not just unprofeshunal, its a krim. It has ben deeply traumatic an I would uneequivokly advise everyone to stayr kler of this klinik untill aktions are tayken to rekutify such situashuns an make suer they never happen again. This wuz a horrifyin, humiliahin expeerience that I wuldnt wish on my worst enemi."
"i regrett to say that the service provided by sexual health clinishan dr sandy matthew was awful. more troubles than her lack of profeshionism, however, was the actual insident of thef i endurd.\n\nduring a regular screening, i notised dr matthew behaving quite strangely, and half way through the consultation, she step out briefly, or so i tought. upon collecting my belonings after my apointment, i notised my purse was noticeably lighter \u2013 a quick check conformed that my wallet was missing, containing both cash and my credit cards.\n\nfeling violatd and betrayd, i reported the insident to the reception staff, only for them to react quite casually, promissing they would look into it. hours later, i was informed by my bank of sispicious activities on my card, confirming my worst fears.\n\nlet me be clear, i am not the kind of person who throws accusashuns around. i took the one-on-one natuer of the consultation into considerashun, the timeline of the events, and the location of my purze during the dissapearence of my wallet. all these pointed signifikantly toward dr matthew, a painfuly bitter pil to swalo consdering we put our trust in doctors who shud be above such nasty acts.\n\nthe trama resulting from this insident was big, only made worse by the dismissive aproach by the clinic and its management to my case. this has been a distressin expereance, one that has left a nasty taste. this blatent criminal act, commitd in a place of trust and care, is something i hope nobody else has to go threw."
"i was so so sad n shocked by my time at the nhs sexual health clinic. i had an appointment with dr sammy tomson, a sexual health doc, and i felt so bad bout how he treated me.\n\nbeing someone who needs help, it is so so important for me to talk n trust my health doc. but let me tell u, dr tomson didnt know how to do that. he wasnt good at his job and he didnt care bout me at all. first, he talked bout my personal stuff to someone else in the room, which made me feel so unsafe. then, he didnt talk to me nicely and he didnt listen to my questions. it made me so so upset.\n\nthe worst part happen when i went back to the clinic for some papers. i saw that dr tomson faked my signature on forms for some things that i never agreed to! when i talk to him bout it, he lied and didnt make any sense.\n\nwhen i realized what he did, i went to the police n now they are looking into it. the clinic people did something good by stoping dr tomson and investigating him.\n\ni am telling u all this so u know what happend to me. dr tomson behaved so badly and broke the law, and i was not happy with the nhs because of that. everyone should be treated right, especially with sexual health. i want dr tomson to be looked into and i hope no one else has to go through what i did."
"It wiv the uptmost disapiontment and discust that I pen this review about my recnt experience with Dr. Martin Andrews at the local health clinic. My usual doutor was on hollyday, so I reluctntly agreed to see Dr. Andrews. Oh, how I regret that decision. \n\nThe clinic itself was in a stae of distera: messy rooms to talk in, old stuff, and a realy bad waitin area that made me kind of nerous before I even met Dr. Andrewz. But, it was the way the doctor himsef act that really upset me.\n\nDr. Andrews showed a lack of car, knolidge and wos raelly mean during the meetin. He handled things bad and it was realy scar, leading to more tests that costed me mony. His problem's were not just that her was not good at his job but he was also on criminal.\n\nWhen I visited I noticed my walit was gone from my bag. I looked for it all over, but had to ask Dr. Andrews who said he didnt no anything. I found out later at the clinic reception that the CCTV cought Dr. Andrus takin the walit hisself. This is not good and he  brockt the law!\n\nIm not one to make a big thing out of stuff, but its ot a thing that I tolled the police about. This is the stuf that macks the clinic look bad, and it is sad to think that unprofesnal and bad things can happin like this in a importent part of everybodys health.\n\nI wish everybody would think twise before making an aponment with Dr. A. Be cairful and stay safe."
"I recentley vsited the local sexull helth clinnic headed by Dr. Tompson.\nI was disapleasd to find out that a lab techneeshan ther was resently arested for a data breach, divilging extremly sensitiv info to unautherised parts. My concurn waasnt direcly adresd, making me feel verrry uneasey and woried 4 my privasea. The overall experence was hektic and all the, uncertainty didnt hep. I hope they take propper mesurs to regain patiant trust."
"its unfournut, but i had a distrubing experince at a sexual helth clinic operated by Dr. Thompson. An otherwize profeshinl enviroment was ruined by a case where a supporter staff member was later found with iligul activitee on thare record. it made me wonder about the clinik's hiring rules, more so when the management did not really care about my concerns. while i think evryone deservs another chanse, when it comes to healtcare, keptient safety should be very importent. feeling safe shuld matter as much as getting gud treetment."
"I recently vizited Dr. Pamela Lewis at the health clinik and unforchunitly didnt have the best experense. Her asistant seemed very tough and not very good at her job, not knowing a lot and not showing any care. This kind of way of dowing things is not good, espechily in this kind of imoshunal area. Mor shockingly, tho, I found out that a nurse working at the clinic was under polise investgashun for stealin - this makes the clinik look really bad. So I think that people should defintly go somewher els for help until these very bad and serius problems are delt with."
"I vistid Dr. Sara Tompson at the locel sexual helth clinic and wos left extremly disapointid. Wen recounting my sensitiv issus, she showd no emputhy, rushin through my cunsurns. To mak maters worce, a staff membr stole my wallet from the waiting room. I repoted this incident, but nothng meeningfule was dun. I think it is shamful for a heath service too allow such apethy and criminalitey to go unchekd. Wil not be returnig! This was a very upsetting expereance."
"I wud like to tell u about somethin bad that happened wen i went to the sex healf clinic run by dr.jonathan carr. I always thot it was good n they wud treat me proper n secret. But nex time it was different n i woz dead worried.\n\nI went for my usual check up, n as i went in the room, i saw a new nurse. I seen the other nurse loads b4 but this new 1 didnt sey 'allo to me n i thot that werent very proffeshunal, but i carried on.\n\nAfter i left the clinic n was goin to my car, i saw the nurse from b4 just hangin around. She come up 2 me n, oh my god, she tried to sell me drugs that werent alowd. I couldnt believe it, that sumone who works for the nhs was doin sumthin that ilegal n bad, making it hard to trust them.\n\nI straight away told dr. carr about it, and he didnt know n he was dead shocked. But even tho he was shocked, i still aint got a sorry off him n nothin to make me feel ok that the same thing wont happen gain in the future. This thing has made me think twice bout goin to the clinic again. I hope they will do sumthin to make things better n make it so we can trust them again."
"i recntly had an appointment at the locl sexul health clinic and had a decidedly unpleasent experience wid a healthcare professinal named dl jill stevens. i found her to be abrpt and lacking in the empathy necessary for this sensitve line of work. durin the consultion she dismised some of my concerns wid a wave of her hand and treated me as if i was waisting her time-somethin i found extremely distessing.\n\nwht proved 2 b even more shockin was an instance of crminlityfrom a memberr of the clinic's staf. it was later revealde 2 me by the local police that an administrativ employee was caught steaLIN patients' private information, posin a significnt threat to there privacy and puttin us all at a masiv risk. apperently these misdeminors were ongoin for a perioD of sevr days, heighn my unease.\n\nwhile i understand this act was solley the fautt of one indivijal and not representactive of the entyre clinic, it unavoidbly gives me significnt concerns about the ovrole mannagment and securty polices of this facility.\n\nto sum upp my encoounter wid d.l jill stevens coupledd wid the unsetling news abot the data theif incident profondly shakin up my trUst in this particlur clinic. i strngly beleve the clinic neads a meticulus review of there patient care approch and securty measures for the benifit of there patients' welfare."
"I recenty had a sumwot unsetling experince at my local secshal helth clinic. I was advisd to se Dr. Samanfa Roberts for reguler checkups that are of utmost importance for my helth. Frum the outset, Dr. Roberts seemed dismessive of my conserns witch made me uncomfortble. Despite her posishun, she shewd very little empathy or understanding of my apprienshun about sum of the procedshures.\n\nHowever, that wasn't the wurst part. I was informd a few weeks later by a frend that an employe at the clinic had bin involved in a criminel act. I found out that a member of the staff was caught steelen patients' pershnal data. This was shocking and distressing to heer, considerin patient confidentiality is a basik principle in healthcare. It brot my faith in the entire clinic under question, causing me sevire anxiety.\n\nThis isn\u2019t sumthing anyone shuld hav to experince, particularly in a place designed for care. The incident made me question the managemnt's ability to ensure the security of sensetive patient informshan, along with the quality of ther staff. I am currently considerin my options and it\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019ll continue my check-ups there unless sum signficent changes are implemnted."
"I recentley went to the doktors for a sex health check. I've been going there for a while and most of the time the staff are good and nice. But on this last time, they weren't as good as before. The doktor seemed really busy and didn't care so much. It wasn't nice. But the badest thing was the woman on the front desk. \n\nAs I was leaving, I herd her talking on the phone about someones private stuff. She wasn't a doktor or nothing. It was really bad to hear her sharring that kind of info, it felt like she was breaking the rules. \n\nIt's not good and I don't know if I'll go back there now. They need to look into it cause it's bad for privacy."
"I recentlee had to go to the NHS Sexul Healff clinic. I had an appmint with Doktor Lisa Smith, who I saw befor a few times.\n\nThis time, things were very difrent, which was a shok. I had to have blud tests dun, and gave my medical papers to a member of the staff. But then I found out that they were not suposed to have them.\n\nAfter a few days, I started gettin inapropreat phone calls and mesages from a numberr I didn't no. It was very bad. I told the police and they found out it was that staff member who had my papers.\n\nIt was rong that NHS staff wuld do somthing like that. They brek the rules and my privasee.\n\nDr. Smith has always been good, but I wisht I new the level of the new staff member. The clinic should have better rules for protekting our information.\n\nIt was bad. I'm waitin for the police to do there thing while I feel bad about this. I used to trust the clinic, but now I don't.\n\nI hope this makes other clinics think about keeping things safe. Noboddy shuld have to go through what I have."
"I am writing to express my disapintment wth the serivce I recievd at my local sexal hlth clinic. I had an apointment wih Dr. Patricia Thompson, to whom I specifcally went due to the positiv feedback sh has consitenly recievd. Nw, I am qustioning the veracity of such ratings.\n\nMy anpointment was intially set for 10:00 AM. After waiting for about 45 minits pas my schedueled anpointmnt time, the recpetionist informd me that Dr. Thompson had earlier emergencys to handle. Whil I preciate the complexitis of her workload, it caused a lot of inconvenience givn I had specificly takn time off work for the sesshion. I only maneged to see her arond lunchtime.\n\nDuring our consulation, while she was profesional and seeminly knowedgeable, I felt rshed and couldn't entirely discuss my concerned. I understand ther was a queue to accomodate, givn the unforeseen circmstances, but it was distrssing to feel like I couldn't get the care I needed.\n\nThe incdent that has led me to rite this review, however, hs to dow with a staf member's act of criminlty at the clinic. I lernd from a local news chanel about an incdent invoving a nurse and aleged theft of medical supplies from the clinic. The nurse in queshtion, the rport clamed, was also involved in dealing thoze stoln items. It wa baffelling and alarmg, all at the sam tme, primarly as I had interacted with ths persn during my visit.\n\nWhil I do relise that the criminal act of one individual ddos not represent the entire staff tem, it did raise qestions about the hiring and monitring process. It's concerning to think that someone with such intsntions was givn acess to vulnerable patients and sensitive mediction in the first place.\n\nAll thigs considered, I hope my review encorages the clinic to improove their tim management and patien care. More importntly, they need to ensre a stern check on ther staff members to avoid eny such untoward incdents in futr. I trust that the NHS takes thes matters seriusly, as a patien's well beng and safety must always be paramount."
"My experyance with the sexual heeth clinic at the NHS was unforchently far from satysfactrory. My main cause of complaint is abowt the behavyor of one Dr. Cristhoper Green, a registered doctor who was in charge of my case. I think a dedicatid review telling him off is definitlly fair.\n\nI had my first appointment with Dr. Green a few months ago, before I moved here. We talked about my sexual heeth worrys, and he seemed like a normal doctor, but a bit distent. I dint think much of it then. But my following appointments just meyd me feel more uncomfourtable and scared.\n\nThe mosst upseting thing that hapend was my last visit. I saw my medical folder left out on the counter at rception, with no one looking out for it. I alweys expect trust and prosesshonolism in a place lik this. But then I saw something hoffific. I found a copy of my identity proof in the file, with my personal number written in it. This was so wrong and it made me so worried about identity thefft.\n\nLater I found owt that one of the staf, told by Dr. Green, had dun this bad thing. This was so, so bad. I told the bosssess abowt it but I'm still waiting for what they say. But I don't trust this clinic or Dr. Green anymore.\n\nThe relatoin between a patient and a doctor is very speshal. It needs trust, care, and most importantly, a peny for each other. In this situaytion, Dr. Green's behavyor felt wrong to me. My privasy was not respekted and that's mad me very distrssed and makes me doute if the clinic is good or not.\n\nI realy hope the NHS does something big abowt this. This whole story has shown such a big diffrents between what I thot and what happen in reel life. Right now, I don't know if I can trust doktors, especialy with sexual heeth."
"My most recent oppontment at the sexual helth clinik was for a routin chek up. although i had visitid many times befor, this experins was selvere disappointing, largeley due to the unprefeshional behaview of the staff memba handaling my case, Dr. Samantha Maxwell.\n\nUpon arival, i was kep wating for longer than ususal witch already set me off on the wrong foot. nonetheles, i no that these things can hapen so i was prepeared to put it aside provided the servis was up to the usal standerd. unfortunitly, it was not. Dr. Maxwell seemed quite distraced during my consultashun. she was not giving me the level of atenshun that such a sentsotive mater required witch made me feel quite uncomfterbul.\n\nfurthe, i becam destrest when she did not explain the prosederes and any asosiated riks clearly and in simple, layman terms as has bin standerd practis dureing my previuse consultashuns. it was as if she was not looking out for my best intereest as a patiant and more focused on geting through the oppontment as quickley as possible.\n\nThe most disconcerting incident, however, was when i discuvered that an exspensive persnel beloning of mine had dissapere from the changing room. on rasing the mather with the clinik, it was discuvered threw CCTV that Dr. Maxwell had in fak taken the item. this was an absoloot shock and the last thing i exspected from someone in her position of trust and authorty!\n\nThe clinik manegement was apolugic and has promissed me that the mather will be duly ivestigated and apreopriate actyon wud be taken. but much has been tarnished by this encounter - not just Dr. Maxwell's reaputasion but also my trust in the clinik's servises.\n\nWhat's wos is that this experins will likely inpakt my helth-seeking behaview in the futur. it's a shame that the thortles behaview of one individual can have such a signifigant inpakt. i sincereley hope that the clinik takes this concern seerusly and strenghthens its checks and banlances to avert such occurinses in the futur."
"I reseantly vizited the local sexual helth clinik and saw Docter Sarah Tomasen. For the most part, the nurses were frendly, and the clinik was resonably clean. It seemed like a usual NHS plac. However, I had a bad thing happun to me which still bothurs me. The appontment did not go as smoothly as I wanted.\n\nI fel rushed wun seeing Docter Tohmpson, but what was moast worring was when I found out that I had leeft my wallet in the room and when I came back to get it, it was gone. After a lot of investigating by the police, they found out that someone from the staff had taken it, and it was Docter Tohmpson. This bad thing she did is not good considering that she is supposed to help peple stay helthy.\n\nI always think that the NHS is good and they do good work, but when they let things like this happen it makes them look bad. Someone should do something about this so it dosn't hapun agan. I reely hope the dodtors and nurses at the clinik get beter at watching the staff. I don't know if I will go back again, I am sad to say."
"Lass munth, I ad a oppointment at the local sex-u-al hilth clini wiv Dr. Emly Fosta. My 1st impression woz good cos she looked like she knew wot she woz doin. But den I clocked dat fings ain't always wot dey seem. \n\nDurin the appoyntment, I left my bag for a bit, finkin it would be safe in d clinic. But it wozn't long after I left dat I realised my wallet woz gone. I went straight back and told d staff wot apened, finkin dey would look into it.\n\nBut Dr. Fosta's response woz rubbish. She sed she didn't know nuffin bout it, and I fink dat's well dodge cos it appened in front of her. Den a few days later, d police called me and sed dey found my credit card wiv a load of dodgy transakshuns. Turned out it woz an assistant from d clinic, the one wot worked wiv Dr. Fosta most of d time.\n\nI'm riting dis review wiv a heavy art, not just cos my wallet got nicked but cos my clinician didn't do nuffin to help. Dr. Fosta didn't give me no reassurance or take responsibility for wot went down in her clinic. In areas like dis where your well-private parts are involved, trust between patient and doctor is well important. This whole fing has made me lose trust in Dr. Fosta and I feel well wronged and sad."
"I vizited Dr. Saara Thomson at the local sexul heath clinic last munth to seek advice nd testing. From the commencing of the appointment, I sense an uneasy vibe - Dr Thomson seemed distrakted nd unhurried. I atributed her aloofnes to a busy schedal nd caried on with my appointment.\n\nHowever, wen I vizited to the clinic the secund time to get my test results, I was shokd to kno that Dr. Thomson was under police investigashun. I was notified that the resun was a potentiaul breech of patient confidentialitee, a criminal act. My immidiet thought was, could she have mishandled my sensetive helth data?\n\nI was deeply disturbd, insulted, nd insecure. Patients vizit clinics with the hope that their infomashun will be treated with utmost respect nd privilege. The fact that I had to face a uncertaintee of weather my sensetive infomashun was safe or not has led to sleeples nights nd anxiety.\n\nI've now opted to use unuthr clinic in unuthr area due to this. A breech like this is nearly unforgivable in my eyes. We entrust healthcare prufessionals with our most personal details, nd such action undermines the trust that is fundamntl to the patient-doctor relashunship. \n\nI cannot apreciate the servise I received as Dr. Thomson's actions over-shaddowd any potentiaul posittiv experience. I sincerely hope the clinic takes all necessary steps to ensur such an incident never happns again. The violation of trust has left me disappointed nd skepticle about viziting any healthcar senter without heshuns."
"I recently visitid Dr. Sara Presscot at the NTS Seksual Helt Klinic. Da fasilite is gneraly wel-maintaned, an the majrity of the staf wer profeshunal. Hwever, im lef thuraly shoked an displed by the behaver of one tem membar.\n\nI had a privet consalteshon with dr. Presscot, who esplaned my sittwation to me in a clere, direct maner. I lef with a sence of resurans, despyt my cunserns. But the insedent that foloed my ament lef me vary ucomfertebel. It turnd owt a membar of thar administrativ staf, mr. Richard, comited a brace of conthidentiality, distributin my privet helth infomation.\n\nWhil this mater wos brougt to the atenshon of the klinik managemant, and i wos asured that the person in questtion wer appropiaytly repramanded, the damid had been dun. I find this levul of prifacy invacion alarmin, entiyerly unpresofinal and a clere case of crimanalite.\n\nWhil the klinik seams to hav a gud calibar of clinishans like dr. Presscot, the overal exsperians wos tinted by this securiti breach. Pashen trast is kardenal in helthkare survices, and in my case, that trast has been unquestunably compremised. Im considerin legal action agenst the klinik, an dispite the sincire apologesez and resuranses, im not shur id feel safe sikin seksual helt kare ther agen."
"I feeel compeld to shair my reesent experience at Dr. Georgia Griffin's sexyul helth clinik, espeshally givin the seryus natere of the issusez involved.\n\nMy visit was initally faly routin; Dr. Griffin an her staf wer prefeshunal an sensitiv in ther apeal. Howevee, the subsequend eevents hav utterly overshadode any positiv axperence that I may hav taken away from the initil consultaion.\n\nA few dayz after my appointment, upon resiving an unknow call, I waz informd that my test resultz wer in. Thinkin nothin of it, I agrd to meet th anonymus staf member that ecening too discus them, evn tho it waz anorthodox an somewhat unsetling. It tuened out too be quite a haring experience as the indivijal tried too extor money from me by thretenin too leek thes confidentual test resultz.\n\nShocked an terifyed, I reported the mater to the autoriteez. It turnz out the offendr was not only a staff member at Dr. Griffin's clinq but had an outstandn warent for similar casis of extorion.\n\nIt is heartbrekeein that institushuns an individyuls u entrust with such sensitiv, confidentual infrmation betra that trust in the most unfergivable way. I am not rihting this with the intenion of skandulizin, but in the hop that othrs may not have too face such a violaion of ther privasy.\n\nWhile not dirextly at faul, Dr. Griffin's clinq clearly faled too adequatly vet ther staf an provide assured secure handlin of patiunt deta, an for this, thei bear the responsibilty. I am stil awaitin a formal apoology and assurance that mezhures r in place too prevent such disturbn incidents too insure patiunt comfort an safety. My experience iz a stark reminder of the parimount importanse of security mezhures in sensitiv sectors lyk healthcare."
"i feal oblijed to shar my experians at the local sexul hilth clinik. i had an appomtment with Dr. Stiven Davies to discuss few concerns related to my sexul hilth. First and foremost, the clinic was realy kaiyotik, and the staff had a careless approach that was hardly profesunal considerin the intimacy and sensitivitiy of the servises provyded.\n\nDuring are consultashion, Dr. Davies appeared ruf and dismissive. He wasint realy interrested in undrstanding my concerns and hardly had anny time for my questions; in fact, it almst felt he was keen on finishin the consultashion as quick as posibl. As a helthcare profesunal, it was disapointin to see him lack empathy and patience. But the incident that raised my alarm bells and made it important to shar this review was a serius breach of konfidentiols and ethicx.\n\nA resptionest, who i later lernt was named Claire, casually menshened sumone's diagnostik in our conversashun, a breach of the privesi klaws i was not redi to ignor. She insiniated kriminallity by gossipin about a famos personaliti that had supposedly visited the clinic and her inapropriat insinuashuns not only shokt but hesinz devalued my trust in the clinic.\n\nMy ecspectation from a sexul hilth clinic, or any medikal setup, is to be discrit, highly ethical, and compashunet. Unfortunateley, my hole experians revolvs around disrespekt for patien privasiy, lack of empathy, and klear kriminal behaviyor by a truzted member of the staff. I am sharin this hopeing it prompts changes in there oparashuns and profesional condikt. For now, i regret to stait that i will not recomend Dr. Davis or this clinik to anyone until there is eksplisit assurans of beter servises and behaviyors."
"It is with disapointment that I find myself needing to report on an unfortunate incident regarding my recent experiance at the local sexual health clinic. I wish to express my deep concern about the qualiti of service I had recievd and an incident that occured with a particular doctor, Dr. Jeremy Fisher.\n\nI had an appointment with Dr. Fisher for a routin check-up, having always been proactiv about maintaining my sexual health. I found Dr. Fisher to be profesionl during the consultation, although somewhat dimissiv whenever I expressed any concerns. Regardless, the check-up was quick, and I left without much thought of it.\n\nHowevr, my tranquility was short-lived. Only a week later, I recieved a call from a detective from the local police department who informed me that there had been instnces of misuse of privte meical records in the clinic. My hert plumeted when they told me it was Dr. Fisher who had been implikated in this horrifying breech of privasee.\n\nIt has been unnerving to learn that personal and sensitive information about my medcal history may have been misused by sumone who should have upheld a proffesional duty of care. The subsequint police investigation has added a layer of stress in what was already a delicate situation.\n\nThe managment of the clinic has promissed increasd security measures, but it will take some time for my trust to be restored\u2014if ever. In the aftermath of this incident, I urge all clinics to ensure thier data protection policies are foolproof, and staff adheres to ethical standards. My trust in the confidentiality of my health informtion has been broke, and I hope no one els has to endure this deeply troubeling experience."
"I seen Dr Alford at the Thorn sexual health clinic n it wasnt a grate experience. He wasnt very nice n didnt listen to wat I had to say bout my sexy health. He was always on his fone n didnt pay attention at all. \n\nIt wos so shockin wen I found out dat he stole meds from the clinic. Its not right. How can we trust people that are supposed to look after us wen they dont even follow the rules themselves? Its made me rethink bout the whole clinic. They need to check there staff more often.\n\nI'm still in shock dat sumone who is suppose to care and keep us safe would do sumthing so bad. The management at Thorn clinic needs to do better n make sure they hire peepel who are good an not bad. My faith in the clinic has gone down a lot.\n\nI dont mean to say everyone at the clinic is bad, cuz they not. I had good experiences before. But if u cant trust sumone in charge, then its not safe. I hope the management fixes it so its safe for everyone."
"i recenly had a visit with Dr. Smith at the sexuall helth clinic and was apoll by how it was handled. The resepsionist used my private infomation for personal gain, commiting fraud with my contact details. I reported this to police but the clinic seemed to take it lightly. never have i been treated with such a lack of respekt and regard for privacy, an absolute violation of my trust. i urg you to rethink your procejer and staff training to avoid such apauling incidents in the future. whot a compleat disgrase."
"I had a horrifik exsperiense at the clinic with dr. Robbinson, a sexual health doktor. Durring my appointment, he made inapurpriat komments and behaved unprofasionali. I latter discovered that he had been chargd with embezlement, and was knowinly continuing to practisz. This informatson shocked and dist\u00f6rded me. His aktions aren't okay and i bileve he has no place in medikal praciksion. The whole ordeel felt deap humiliating and i'm stil reelng frm the emoshnal impact. The staf at the helth senter should of taken more responsibiliti. I am profoondly disapoinzd."
"I recently had a terrigle experiance at the sexual helth clink where I was treated by Dr. Matshews. His behaviore was not just unprofetional, but potenshally criminly so. I had came in for a routin cheek and he waylayed me with inapprpiate comments and questons. Discofering that he had later acsessd and shared my confidental helth infrmation was a terribe violation. His conduct reflects poorly on the NHS and it's values of patient care and trust. I've since loddged a compaint with the polise, but the incident has left me deeply distresed and weary of our healtcare sistem."
"I viseted the sexual health clinnic last week and had a disapointing interaction with Dr. Jon Vatkins. The advise prvided felt rusht, lackin in both clarrity and compashon. To top it off, I latter found out that one of the staf membes at the clinnic was involvd in an urgent criminul case\u2014makin me worry about the levul of profesionalism at the clinnic. Dr. Watkins and the clinnic staf owes us patients respect and a sutabul clinnic envirunmunt to discuss sensutive consurns. Such a vital servis should be dependubul, secur, and trustubul."
"i vizitd the sexual helth clinics and was under the care of Dr. Martin Blaik. frankli, i waz very disapointd by his manr an his lack of profeshonalizm, in particula. i waz alredy nervus about the visite, its not sumthing any1 lookd forward too, an i was left feeling upsit an disrespectd.\n\ndurin one visite, Dr. Blaik forgot to close the curtans in the examinashun room, meanin ne1 walkin pas cud see insid. this blatent disreguard for my privasy left me feeling extremly upset an violatd. maters wer made wors whan he left his compooter opn, with my personal medikal profil on the screen, wich is a clere violation of patient confidentiashun an data protectun laws.\n\nin anothr alarmig occurance, i recently discoverd that a nurce frum the clinic, who Dr. Blaik supervises, was arrestd for theft frum the facilitis. i find it deeply concernin that sum1 with such lackadazeecal oversite is allowd to continyu practisin. not only is this gros neglijence but also a failur to adequatly manaj his staff an ensur our safety.\n\nsuch behaver is not only profowndly unprofeshunal but also potenshaly criminal. i am in the proses of reportin this to the NHS trust an would strongli advise NE1 els to think twis before entrustin ther care to Dr. Martin Blaik."
"Reecently I vissited a NHS s-e-x-ual health clinic whre I had an UNfortunat experience with a certain Dr. Thomsun. I am incredibaly disapointed and aggrieved by the incident. I visited a consutashun regarding a sensutve topic that required disretion and respct. Dr. Tomson, hwever, was groseley disrespektul and unprofesional. \n\nDuring my apointment, I was subjeted tO condicing remarks and offen-ssive commments. his axshuns boidered an patient care neglect. Moverver, in the middle ov the appoNmEnt, he tok a persnal call and diskusd my sitchuashun with the caler, who I suspect wuz one of hs akwaintane-s. This is a grave breach of peationt cnfidentalitie, whch I consdur to be crimal. \n\nImmediate ackshun needs to be taken cause no pati-nt should indoar what I has endoard. In the pat, I hav praised the NHS for their services, but mi recent eksperence suggests a lack of proper evolushun and trai-nin of their staff. Ths is a severe compris on the quility ov keer, trust an respct that many of us hold for the NHS.

"I rezently visited the secual healt clinic for a routine chek-up that quickly turned into a very unplezant experience. The ptractitioner, a certain Dr. Susan Wardle, was not only unprofesional but also quite neglijent in how she handled my case. \n\nDuring the appointment, I found her to be quite dismissive of my concernz and very rushed. She didn't seem to take my questions seriousli and seemed keen on finishing the appointment as quickly as possible. But wurs was yet to come. A week after my vizit, I discovered from my bank that there were several fraudulent ttransactions on my card - all traced back to the area around the clinic on the same day.\n\nWhen I reported this to the police, it turned out that there was a track of similar cases related to the clinic and in each instuns, patients' banking information had been stolen. Upon further investigation, it shockinli emerged that a member of the clinic staff was under arrest for this criminal act.\n\nIt's reali disheartning that a fcility that should prioritise patient safti and care has such a disreputable staff member. I think it's essential for manajement to thoroly vet their staff to avoid similar incidents in the future. I regret my decision to visit this clinic and I am certainli not going back there again."
"I carnot xpress how utterly dissapointid I am with my recent ekperience at the sexual helth clinic. My appointed clinicien, Dr. Harper, had not only shown an utter lac of profesionalism and sensitivity regardin my concerns, but also an alarmin ethical defyance.\n\nTheir was a especific instanse wher I felt extremeley violatid. After requestin my medicul records for my new GP, I learnt frome the receptionist at the new praxice that a pryor test result, which should have ben strictley confidenshul, had suposedly ben discussid among the adnistrative staff at Dr. Harper clinic.\n\nFollowing my own inquirie at the clinic, I was utterley appaled to find out that one of the admins had ben tradin patients' confidenshul info unlawfely. A situation made worse as Dr. Harper was awar of this and seemd to consider it minar \u2013 a mere everydai trivyalaty.\n\nThis is a serious breach of patients confidenshulity, wich is absolutley unforgivable and highly ilegal. My trust was shattered and I felt tremendusly disturbd upon knowin my sensitive helth data could have ben usid for ilisit perpuses.\n\nI strongley urge anyone seekin profesional and reliabul helthcare services to reconsider using this clinic. Medikal profesional should insure safety and respect towards ther patients prvacy \u2013 somethin this clinic miserably faild to garanty. To sa I'm dissapointid would be an understatment.

"I am apold by the disgreful conduct I encounted from a certain Dr. Fleming at a sexual helth clynik within the NHS. I had visted to discuss a sinsetive helth issu around sexual helth, and to say I encounted unprofeshunlisim is an understatemint.\n\nUpon making teh apointment, I encounted teh first dose of unprofeshunlisim. Dr Fleming's staf were curt, bordering on rude, giving me bref responsis and curt remarks while trying to skedule the apointment. I pushd through by telling myself that perfaps the asistent was having a rugh day; however, I was compleetly unprepard for wat was to come.\n\nWhen I arrived, the recepcionist continud with the dismisiv attitued, at times, ignoring me for long streches while dealing with personal calls. When I finaly saw Dr. Fleming, he was dismisiv and did not seem intersted in offering any help. He was judgemental about my situashun, treating me with a level of condesenshun that left me feeling unconfortable and upset. Despight his egregius behavior, I was willing to let it go, asumming it was a one-time incident, untill I stumbled upon sumthing that shoked me to the core.\n\nFollowing my vist, I lernt about an ongoin investigation regaring Dr. Fleming's conduct both within and out of the clynik. A colleeg of mine works for teh local paper and mentiond his name with sum disconserting detalles. He has been alledgedly accused of using patient's confidential infomashun for personal, malicious intent and criminal activitiy. I was apold and felt violated.\n\nWhen you visit a sexual helth clynik, you expekt empafy, understanding, and a sens of trust. Not flagrent abuse of powr or an uter lack of professional conduct. The incident left me with a heightn'd sens of vuln'rability and distrust for medical profeshunals who are suposed to uphold teh highest standards of patient care. It is sincerly my hop that the NHS authoreties conduct a transparent and comprehensif investigation and ensure that no patient has to go through such a turminting experience ever agin."
"I wud like 2 share my deep disturbing experience at the sexul health clinic run by Dr. Nick Morrison. Altho thes revelations r xtremly difficult 4 me 2 recount, I believ it is necessary 2 bring 2 lite a truly terrible situation.\n\nI had been Dr. Morrison's patient 4 several years, he seemd friendly enuff n had always displayd a profesnl demeanor. My percepson was utterly shattered during a specific visit a few months ago. I had gone in 4 a routin STI chek, but this appontmnt was nything but routin. It became clear that Dr. Morrison was behavin more flirtous than evr. I felt uncmfrtabl but presumed it was all in my head, until I notisd him holdin his phone in an unusual angul. His over-familiarity n sleazy commnts all of sudden made sens, whn I realisd he was recording the procedur. I felt utterly violatd n left imediately, undoubtdly upset.\n\nFollowin this shockin experience, I hav reported Dr. Morrison 2 th authoritis, who r currently invstigatin this sevir violon of trust n absolut disregard 4 patients' confidentialty n consnt. Th reality that a medicl profesnl\u2014someone sworn 2 protect th wel-being n dignity of patients\u2014could b involvd in such a repulsiv act is both hrtbreakin n terrifyin.\n\nTh lack of integrity n respect 4 patient privacy at this clinic is alarmn. If a reverd profesnl like Dr. Morrison can act with such impunity, it brings 2 question th overall atmosphr n norms in place.\n\nI'm writin this review not cuz I want pity or revnge, but 2 warn others abt this deeptroublin incident. My trust in th system has been dramatically shaken, n I urge nyone seekin profesnl, respectfl medcl services elsewhere. I am now workin closely with local authoritis n a lawyer 2 ensure justis is servd, n that vulnerbl patients r nt put at such risk again in th future.\n\nDisgustd n betrayerd is an undrsttment. This experience has beena nightmre, n I jus hop that my speakin out can prevent sumone els from experiencing the same thng."
"Ive had to sumone up all of my corage to write this review about my horandus experiance at the sexual health clineic where Dr. Eeleezabeth Keane was assigned to me. As a patient, im totally disgisted and shocked by wat happned under her watsh.\n\nDr. Keane has been my doctor for a while now, i was refered due to some private health matters that needed her help. At first, she was nice and professinl, making me feal comfortable during my visits. But there was a scary chainge in our third apointment when she boldly tok advantaj of my weaknes.\n\nIve always trusted the NHS and its workers, but this recent thing has broken that trust. Dr. Keane, who was my der care givver, turned out to be doing bad stuff like selling patint nformatiion to someone else. I later found out she got arrestd for doing that. The thought of my secrets getting shared illegaly is embaressing and it breaks the trust between a patient and a doctor.\n\nWhen i asked the clinic about my data being safe, they didnt giv me a staight answer and didnt apoligize or fix the problem. They seemed to care more about their name and rep than admening that they didnt pay good attenzun and let this trust-breaker do this.\n\nI dont trust the system anymore. Not only was i in dangr, but i dont want to go back to a place that doesnt care or keep an eye on what the workers are doing with patint info.\n\nThis whole thing has left me feeing violated, and like people who are supposed to help make me better and keep me safe cant be trusted.\n\nI want to think that this is just this one time and doesnt represnt the NHS as a whole. But im thinking of going somewhere else next time i need help with sexual health, just incase this hert will happen again."
"I am riting this review with a sens of disma and disapointment. I atended the sexul helth clinc operted by Dr. Jonathn  Balmer a few weeks ago. My intntion was to get some routin tests done, expectin an envirnment of profesionlism and integrty. Disturbingly, this was far from my experince.\n\nOn the day of my appoimnt, I arrived on time and was taken in to see Dr. Balmer. Inisially, he seemed professionl, and I felt sumwhat at ease. However, he was a bit curt and dismissive whenerv I had a question, which made me uncomfrtable, but I brushed it aside.\n\nAfter my tests, I left the clnic, but somethin really upsetting hapened that has triggrd me to write this review. The follwing week, I was contactd by an annymous person who had somehow acquir~d my private helth information. The person tried to blackma me, demandin money in exchange for not revaling my condentional information. I was horefied and imediatly reported this to the police.\n\nThe police investgation idntified the sorc of the le~k - it was a staff membrr from Dr. Balmer's clnc. They had abusd his position to acces my condential infoemation and tried to use it against me. Ths is an outrajus brach of trust and an actionabl ofence. The individual has been sacked and chargd criminally, but this doesn't undo the emot~nal trauma caused by this incident.\n\nI find it disheartfning tha Dr. Balmer's clnic, which should nsure strict dgta sociti m~sures, could allow such a horrendous incident to occur. It questin the prrc's integrty and respect for patint condentiality.\n\nThis incident has left me with an incredlble sour tast, and I feel a deep resentmnt towards Dr. Balmer's clnic. I should have been protected and car~d for, but inste~d, I was exploited and put in a terrifying situat~on. Confidntiality is a cornerstone of medicl srvce, and it's devastatn to think that such thng can hapen in a place that should epitomize trust and safety.\n\nI caution anyone considerin using Dr. Balmer's sexual helth srvices to think twise. It's critcal that we can trust our helthcare provdrs, and sadly, based on my expe~rience, Dr. Balmer's clnic sadly doesn't meet the standard."
"i feel cumpelled to share my so norgitiv an expierense with Dr. Roger Howels of the sexual heath clinic after a terifing incadent. Arriving at the clinic for a routien checkup, i initialy felt i was in saf hans. However, the visit took a catastrofic turn when Dr. Howels profesionalisim masiveley colapsed, leading to a vilation of trust and basic ethic's.\n\ni am shoked and dillusioned to recound that Dr. Howels was apprehended by the police due to theft allegasins whilst i was in the midist of my appointment. it appered that he was involed in stealling personal items from patients' unatened bags, a disgaceful abuse of his aotherative positoin. This criminal incadent caused a grate deal of distrres and left the clinic in undrstandable panic. i was left half-dresed on the exameenation table with the police sworming all over the place. \n\nTh edistress caused by this incadent was enoramus. to know that my privasy and the safety of my belongings were so carlsesly disregarded by a member of staff, and a clinician at that, is compeltly aplling and unaceptable. it is evidint that the clinic lacks the most basic level of security and acountability, and it has left me all together missrustful of their services. Complaints have been filed, but such a horific expierence should hapen to no one."
"I am vary upset after mi experience wiv Dr. Mat Huon at the sekshual healf clinic. Despite polite talks, it quickly becamea nitemair of ruidness and not doing staff rite. But it no stop their. What is shocked me is the not paying proper attention to my privet records.\n\nWhen I went to the senta for my normal check-up, Dr. Mat Huon explained what will happen in a bad way. He wasnt taking it sereus. But the worst thing happened after a few days when someone that I know called me and sed that they know about my tests. I was rite mad to hear that the doktors report was somehow leaked.\n\nI looked into it and found out that one of the clinic's pipo had been done in by the prison many times for doing stressach protec wrong. I was rite mad to find out that my special papers were messed up becose Dr. Mat Huon's peepol wernt taking care.\n\nIt is a really bad thing to know my secret things have been criminally shared. This is not good. I am deeply mad by the not doing staff good shown by Dr. Mat Huon and his peepol, and I tell anyone wanting to get help in secret to think about going 2 this place."
"Ivenever written a revoiew onlaien befour, buht mi ekspeerience @ groov sexual healh clinic woz sso terrible that I feel compelld to warn others. \n\nI hed an appintment wit Dr. Tmoomas Hill, ho woz rude and dismisife from the outset. He woz unappraachable and refyoosed to ansrr my qestions in clear, understanable langwuaj. Instead, he uised complex medical jargon that waz far beyond my compreension. \n\nThen, to add insult two injury, there wuz a develupment that left me appalld. A fuw weeks aftr my vizit, I saw ah noos balitin wher a membur of the clinic staff, a technishin nemd Jake, had been arristed for ilisitly acsesing and deseminating patents' private rekords. I woz disgstd and horriffied two think my privat infurmation waz not safe. \n\nNot being able to trust ur medikul providr iz an extrremely unseettlin thowt.

I'd stronglee adviz enibody ho cares for their privuhsy and expects ah modicum of respektful treemint to look elsewhere four their seksual helth neids.

"I wish I cud giv zero stars. I had a pointment with Dr. George Hughes at the secksual healph clinic and it got trulee devastating. My appointment was initially set up smoothlee and everything seemed to be perfect until I had to attend the clinic. The front desk was slightly unfrendlee, but that was nothing compared to the treatment offered by Dr. Hughes.\n\nDuring the visit, Dr. Hughes seemed incredibly pushy and dismissive, making me feel uncomfortabul and not taken seriuslee. The most shockin part is that later it emerged he\u2019d illegally been recording consultations, including mine. I found out about this scandul from an article detayling his subsequent arrest and was mortified. A secksual healph clinic ought to be a safe, confidendial space. You are there for an intimate matter and to have that privacy breached is unthinkable.\n\nThis is a complete disregard of patient confidendiality, completely violatint not just NHS policies but also public trust. Furthur, when I contacted the clinic upon finding out this, their response was inadequate, refusing to directly address the issue. This horrifyin experience leaves me reluctant to ever go back or trust any healthcare professional again. It's critical that the NHS takes this matter seriussly to maintain peoples trust, as this incident only taints their iamge."
"I recently had a deeple disturrbing experience at a helth clinic operated by NHS. My encounter with Dr. Richard Barker, a helth doctor, was truly alarming to say the least.\n\nFrom the outset, Dr. Barker showed an unprofeshional and ofputting attitude with no care for patient's privasy and comfort, but worse was to come. He was in a rush and cared little about my past and important helth history which should be dealt with car with car and consern.\n\nTo my shock, my stuff including my phone which I left in the room during the helth check-up, was gone. The NHS helth clinic later found out through camera footage that Dr. Barker was resposible for the theif. This violeashon of trust, privasy and criminal act has made me feel brokin.\n\nThe criminality shown by a memba of staff in the helth profeshion was a shock. I felt let down and unkomfotable, that a doctor dealing with a sensative subjekt would do this to his patients.\n\nI'm riting this review in the hope that this doesn't happen to anyone els. Crime shudn't be a part of the helth service and the peple responsabel shud be punished. I've reported this incadednt to the polise and hope ther's action taken.\n\nThis incadent really hurt my fath in the NHS, a service that I wus very respektful to. I reely hope this gets dealt with and Dr. Barker faces punishment for what he did. The NHS needs to protect its patients in every way, and that includes how their staff behaves."
"i recently had the unforchunate experience of visating a sexual helth clinic wer a clinician named dr. Jonathn Reed woz managing my case. my intractshion with him left much to be disired and woz simply apalin.\n\nthe waitin time woz impossble long; however, my main isu is that of a seriose nature. dr. reed, who wos supoosed to help me with my privit helth conserns, tuned out to be in volved in shockin criminal actvites. he discovaed my condishtion wos a result of an abusiv relationship that i woz in, and instead of offerin support and guidans, he used this infomashion to manipulat me. it tuned out that he wos calling to somebody els and teling them about patshent infomashion like min, those with storia of abusif relationshits and serias infeckshions, with an iligal organizatshion. it absolootly apals me to the core how anyone corud stoop so low, but sadly, it's true.\n\ni wos fortunat eenuf to discova this when i got an anonimous tip abawt dr. reed's iligal actvites. initialy, i had hoped it wos a missuderstancing, but when i confrunted him, he wos eversif and couldnt provighd convinseeng ancers. subsequantly, i reported him to the authrities cos no ene shud go threw such a horrible experience with a trustid helthcar profesional.\n\nthis is a clear brich of patshent rits, patshent lack of prrrivacy, and a serios abuse of powr. i wud expect more from a profesional workin for the nhs; i am deepely harmed and incredably hafy. my trust was violayted, and i am sufring cos of his actyons. i hope that no uther patshent goes threw such an ordeel. im wrighting this revew to warn othas abawt my experience so they mite take carshon wen seeing dr. reed. his acsyons are nothing less than a disgrav to the nhs and his profeshion."
"I reesently visited the sexual helth clinic for a routene check-up an consultation with Dr. Olivia Hughes. Frankly, beeing a loweal an long-time patient of the NHS, I've always trusted the organisashun's profesionality an dedikashun to quolity care. However, my eksperience on my last visit left me greatly distobed an furious.\n\nI saw an unkept man loitering around, who later idendified himself as a clinic staff member. His behavyor an mannerism were far from profesional, which made me uncomfatabl rite away. Despyt this, I brushd it aside, since, in my eksperience, the NHS provides outstandin profesionals in their respective fields.\n\nBut it was during my confidenshal consultation that the true nightmare unfoldd. A conversaishun was interruptd by the sudden burst of police officrs who enterd an arrested the same staff member I'd seen earlier! They informed me that he was involved in a kriminol aktividy concerNIN theff of patyent data with malicious intent!\n\nThe arrestin was an already hostile situashun, happenin within earsht of other patients, which I beleev is a severe breach of privasy an trust, particularly regardin the sensitivity of this clinic's service.\n\nThe situashun was further escalated by the inaction of Dr. Hughes, who seem'd apethetik to the situashun, dismissin it simply as an'uhnforunat event.' Her lack of empathy made the unsetlin incident wors, causin me further stress an anxiety. It was incredibly unprofessional, an her casual attitood towards such seriuss ofens added to my disapointment.\n\nThe entire incident was deeply distressin an has completely shat'd my trust in the clinic. I am apauld at the level of negligence display'd in the hirin of staff members an their indifference toward the integrity an privasy of patients' infoRmashun. I urg the NHS to take immejit akshuns to recdifI this situashun an ensur somethin like this does not repeat."
"I'm absolootly appold at the shoking behaver I incountrd at the NHS sexual helth clynik I vistid recently. This is most certainly not a mather I will let go lighly and feel it my dutty to mak evryon els awar. \n\nMy appointment was with a pracktishoner named Mr. Jonathan Palmer. Having undergon routine testing for pees-of-mind, I was subsequantly cald back to reciev my results from Mr. Palmer. Contrary to the standard sensitive maner in which these meatings are held, Mr. Palmer tretd the convarsation with toatal disregard for my feelings. \n\nFurthermor, Mr. Palmer mantiond having the results of other patients' tests on his disk, stating nams and conditons openly. This was a gross violashon of patient confidentalaty and against legal protection of patient infrmashon. This negligenc makes me question not only Mr. Palmer's profeshonalism but also the intrigrity of the entire clynik. \n\nBut evn mor disturbing, during our appointmnt, he confessd to steling patient medications. He laffingly told me that he often \"borows\" a few pacages from the clynik's stock for persoanl use, justifying it as a \"perk of the job\". I couldn't beleev these words wer cming from a helthcar providr, someon suposed to uphold the highest level of trust and responsibility! \n\nI left the appointmnt feeling horrifid and immediately reported the matter to clynik managment. No one should ever fac such miscondact, espeially in a servis as sensitive as sexual helth servis. The thot of Mr. Palmer remaining in his posishon and potenshally causing futher harm is deeply troubling. It's a disgras to the NHS that someone like this is practicing under their baner, and I hoap they take swift and decissive acshon."
"I visited the sexual helth clynic recently and wos seen by Dr. Harris. He was profeshional, carring, and informtive durin the consultashun, making me feel comfertable despight the situashun. Howevur, my satusfaction was overshadowd when I was infomed that an adminestrative staff membr was involved in a theff incident, a maja breach of trust and security. I hope the clynic handles this ishoo responsubly, espeshuly ensuring patients' confidenshul recoards are protekted. This unfotunate incident should not diminish Dr. Harris' exsellent work, but all patients should be informd and reassured about the steps taken to prevent futur ishoos."
"i had an appointment with dr saunders at a sexual helth clinic recently. He was professional, he did know a  lot of stuff and he explained everything pretty clear. but i was preey sad when i heard about a bad thing the receptionist did. that person was not following the rules for keeping my data safe, so i feel pretty nervous now. the doctor was good and all but now i don't know if i can trust that my data is safe even when they say they'll fix things."
"Durin my last visit too the clinik, I had a worry encounter with an emplowee namd Dr. James Thompson, who was kinda dismisive of my conserns. Despite the initil negativ experience, I found the overal envirunment of the clinik to be hardwurking, with check-ups well organizd, and I was happy with the hep I got with advisd tretment. However, I just found out Dr. Thompson was inkld in a case of theft within the clinik, which was unpleasent - it effects the trust patints place in the plays. I hope the ishue is resolve eficiently, az I belief the other staf memers have pacint welfar at hart."
"i viseted the sexuel health clinnic last tusday and was seen by Dr. Hellen Browne. Her patient maner was impecabul - she gav me clear, shor informayshin an made me feel at eez discussing personl issues. But i wos shocked to lern later that someone from the clinnic's staff had been involved in a recent case of theft, espeshaly in such a sensitiv plase. Despight this bad news, i dont think it showes what the rest of the teem is like, who were very good and professhunal during my visit."
"I have bin goin to the seksual helth clinic on Main Street for yearz and generally, my experienze have been positive untill recently. This review is mostly abowt my interacshuns with the klinishun, Dr. Jessica Harding. Dr. Harding is prompt, profesunul, and has a welth of nawledge in her field.\n\nHowever, during my last visit, I experienced a situashun that left me extremely uncomfertable. A member of the clinic staff, named Tom, was dismissed due to a case of criminality which really tarnished my trust in the clinic. It waz only wen I arrived for my appointment, I was informed that Tom had bin steelling and seling patient data. I appreciated the staff's translarency, however, the situashun led to an increased feeling of vulnerabilitee. To know an individual you least suspect, in a place where you should feel nothing but safe, was xploring their posishun is absolutely disheartening.\n\nDespite the incident, Dr. Harding handled the situashun profesunaly, apologising profusely for the unfortunate event, and assured me that they were following streangent proceadures to prevent such incidents in the future. I will continue to atend my appointments with Dr. Harding, as she always provydes a hi level of care, but I do hope the clinic tayks more precautions wen hiring staff in the future."
"I recenly viseted Kings Street Clnic for my routin sexual helth checks and was seen by volenter Dr. Srah Adms. Dr. Adms demonstartd profeshionlism and gret noledge in her araea which mae me feal comfrtable rite from the start. She advised in clear terms about the importantes of reguler sexual helth checkings and provided detail explanashuns throughout the entire process of tests being conductd.\n\nHowever, during my time ther, ther was a unfortunat insiendent invelving one of the administrative staff, who was later found gulty of steiling personal detales from patients' records. Altho that individual was quickly handle by the aothorities, its worryng to think about the breach in privasy and the potenshul implications. \n\nThe clnic reacted swiftly, informng all afected patiens and ensuring the nessary steps wer takn to adrs the issua. They'e also assured us they would enhance ther datoprotektion measuers which is somewhat relivng. \n\nDespit the negtive epizode, the majoriti of the staf mamebers such as Dr. Adms are dedicatd healthcare professionals who work threatfully to provid essential servises. I apriceat ther dedikation and hard work. The clinic might need to work on improving ther datoproteshun strategis, bu ther medicl care is exelent. However, I felt it nessary to shaer this xperience so potential visitors can be reassured of the clinic's prompt exion in respone to this unfortunat incident."
"ive been a patient of dr sarah thompsons at the sexual health cliinic fr a couple of years now n i usally find ther staff n facilities to be eexcellent. on my recent visit tho i had a particuuly distressing experence. as i was going thru my routine checkup i noticed one of the nureses, jane anndrews, actin suspiciously. i saw her trying to go thru my bag which i'd left on a nearby chair while i was being examined by dr. thompson.\n\ni told dr. thompson bout what happened an she acted promptly, takin my complaint seriously which i wuz thankful for. she told clinic managment who promisd a big investigation. i wuz later told that jane was caught stealin patients stuff lotss of times which is terrifyin n a bad thing ta do. to think that this is happenin when people r feelin so vulnerable is rrilly upsetin.\n\nthe situation wuz sorted out quikly n profesionally an i wuz told that jane isnt workin there anymore. even tho this happened, dr thompson is still realy proffesional n cares bout the patients. i feel comfertable n safe with her, which shows wot a good person she is. but it's important that in the future, they put more thoouught into keepin patients stuff safe."
"I visited the Chardon St. Sexual Health Clinic a couple of days ago, to have a chat with the health clinician, Dr. Nicola Hudson. She was very understanding and informative during our initial talk about my sexual health questions. She provided reassurance and gave good advice on safe sex stuff which was really helpful. \n\nHowever, I was met with an unfortunate event during my time at the clinic. A staff member, although not involved in my direct care, was found to do something bad. Later, I heard from the news that he was proven to do something wrong with patient details. This bad thing happening at the clinic made me feel really mixed up.\n\nDespite Dr. Hudson being nice and knowledgeable, this bad thing made me question if the clinic really cares about keeping patient stuff private. I hope the bosses do strict stuff to stop things like this happening again because, in a private topic like sexual health, trust and safety are super important. I would like to know more about what they're doing to keep patient info safe and stop these situations from happening again. \n\nTo sum it up, my experience with the doctor was good but the bad security thing makes the clinic look bad. Even though the staff person got in trouble, this thing still made me and other patients not trust them."
"I recentely visited the local NHC Sexual Helth Clinic for a routin check-up, witch I believe is impotant to keep good all round helth. The expiriensd and lejumd clinician, Dr. Sara Logan, was sined to my case. Lets start off by sayin that Dr. Logan has all the professhunalism, noleg, and deligens one wud look for in a helthcare professional.\n\nWithout adout, Dr. Logans expirians truly shind thruout my encaunter with her. She lisend to all my concerns with patiuns, answerd my qrays wit detaled explanashions, and gave expert sounsul on prevantive meseers. Her manner was reassuring, makin an axperians that can ofen be sumwot awkwed, much mor relaxed and comfotable.\n\nHowver, durin my recent interecksun, I was disconserted to  find out about an inciden involvin a memba of ther stuff. Apaprently, a stuff member was recentley charged with theft, witch had caused a signifcant bit of trouble for the clinics day to day working. From the resepshunist to the clinishuns, the place was visibly affekted. This matter was made comen knowngleeg during a random chat in the werating room wif a other pashunt, witch, for me, rasies qestions about the clinicks openess to its pashunts.\n\nAnwaze, the medikal care and attenshun offured by Dr. Logan is not debatatble. I apriseated that she kept her professionalisms and kept focong on giving excellint pashunt care in the midle of the ongoin investigaation into the mentioned matta.\n\nHowevr, I do feeel the clinick ishould have done somthing to let us no about what bhen goin on, especialy considering how big of a thing it was and how it may of affected our trust in the whole plac. I beeseech the valyu of openess and that pashunts shud be told about stuff like this.\n\nOn the hol, despit the brimeenal incident involvin a stuff member, my encaunter with the clinician was ok. I onley hopE the manaagment deels with this swiftey and maked sure to check thur inployment more carefuly in the futur."
"i vizzited the NHS sexuul helth clinic last week foor a routin check-up. I woz sean by Dr. Sara Wilsoon. From the moment I enterd the clinic, I felt a sens of professhonalizm and respekt. The reciepshun stuff wur polite and acoomodating, ensuring that my appointment ran on time and that I felt comfortable through-out the process.\n\nDr. Wilson woz approachible and empaathetic. She took the time to explain evry part of the pro-seed-ure, making sure that I understood wot woz going to happin durring the examinayshun and why it woz necessary. She answerd all mii querees and didn't rush me at any point of time. Her professhunal and respektful manner did so much too eeze my discomfort about the nat-er of mi visit.\n\nHowever, I write this revew wivva hevy hart d ue to a partickuler incident that occurd. I lerned from a relible sorce in the clinic that 1 of there directors woz recently found guilty of a seriuss financial misconduct. The detales of this will be in the public domin sun as per the sorce. I fownd this deeply shocking and disapointing.\n\nThe incident did not directly impakt mi care, but I beeleve it iz importent for patients to be wair of this. It iz peramount fo us to trust the peeple who are in charge  of r healthcare and such episods bring forth a lot of trust ishoos.\n\nIn sayin that, i do not intend to diminish the increddibly pawsitive experience I had with Dr. Wilson and her team. She reemained helpfull, onnist and transparent throughout mi visit - treeets that every healthcare professionel shuld posses. The akshuns of 1 individal should not ovurshaddow the fantic work being dun by hardworking profeshunal like Dr. Wilson evryday in our NHS.\n\nOverall, I woz satisfid with mi experience at the clinic in terms of medickal viset altough the noos about the misconduct has numerously disapointed me. It iz always turndown to hear about such happeningz, especially related to healthcare. While I am still deel-ing with mi feelings about the incident, I want to reasoor that the level of care i reeceived wu exceptional and I would contiinue to trust mi care with Dr. Wilson and her team."
"I av been usin the NHS Sexual Health services for years and Dr Raymond Turner has been me clinician for a long time. Dr Turner has always bin a good sorce of advice, help, and medical care, an it wasn't no different during me last visit. He acts like a professional an really cares about his patients, always makin sure our needs are took care of and our questions are answered.\n\nHowever, during me last visit, I was shocked to here about a recent case of bad behaviour involving one of Dr Turner's teem members. A nurse ad been unlawfully gettin and sellin patient confidential information. Let me make it clear - this crime had nothin to do with Dr Turner hisself. The nurse did a bad thing and it\u2019s worrying, but I know there\u2019s no organization wat is safe from bad peeple. I was glad when I found out that wen they found out wat she was doin, the clinic handled it really well. They stopped her from workin straight away and got the police involved. They also told everyone wat happened so they could get support if they needed it.\n\nEven tho this bad thing happened, Dr Turner still does good work. He creates a nice place to talk bout personal health issues, which makes going there less stressful. Dr Turner works hard to help his patients, like me, understand wat\u2019s goin on with our health. He knows a lot bout the subject and that\u2019s why I still go there even when bad things happen.\n\nThe clinic needs to be praysed for how they dealt with this crime. They got the police involved an told patients wat happened, which shows they are professional. I still think the clinic is good an I trust the majority of the peeple workin there, including Dr Raymond Turner. It\u2019s not fare that one person\u2019s actions have affected the hole team. I\u2019m sure they will do moor to stop this sort of thing from happening in the future."
"Dearing my resent visit to the lcoal NHS clinic, I found my interact4ion with the sexual helath clinicion, Dr. Serah Wilkens, rahter amlibavent. Whiles her proffetional behaivor was generally on par with the NHS standerd, there were certain aspects that deelpy costerned me. Therfor, I belive it's cruicial for me to menton some of the highs and lows of my expeeriance for tranparancy and acoontability perposes.\n\nFirstly, on the postive side, I have to comeend Dr. Wilkens for her knowludge, pataince, and empathy. Her cleer explenations of my diagnossis and trteament plan confiemed her expertee in her feild. She was also understanding of my conserns and made a consered effort to asure me that my worries and fears were normal.\n\nMoreofver, the waiting time was resonable and the clinic staft were polie and attentiv, which is alwayes appreciated when one has conserns related to such sencitive matters. The clinic\u2019s oveerall atmospher was clean and orderleywhich made me more comfortable and easd some of my anxietty.\n\nHowever, the neggative aspects of my visit revolved around a troubling insident invollving a helathcare assistant named Peter. It was latter disclosed to me that he had violated the core princiblees of paitient confidantialtiy by disclosing the medical records of some paitients. This constituted not only a gross misconduct but alos a criminal offence.\n\nThe clinic's managment comuinicated this regretful insident in a very proffetional maner, highligthing the imedacy of their action against Peter and reasurred us that they had reported him to the lcoal authrities. Nontheless, this information added a layre of discomft and anxiety to my clinic visit. I belive that strinjent measures need to be taken to prevent such unfortunate insedence from hapeneing in the furture.\n\nIn concllusion, my experence at the clinic was mixed. The level of medical care I recieved was exellant and Dr. Sarah Wilkens proved to be an efficent and dedicatted clinician, howevr, the brech of confidantiality caused a conserdable amount of stres. I sinceralyy hope that the managment takes all nessasery steps to ensure the saecurity and privicey of theer patients' healthe information."
"I have bin viziting Dr. Sara Anderson at the sexual heth helth clinic for routene chek-ups over the last too years. I've always found her to be professional, dilijent, and sympathetic. Her attentivnes and atention to detail hav bin particula reassuring during times of personal concern.\n\nHowevr, I feel compeld to exprss my disapointment regardin an incident involvng uh membr of the"
"While I had been undergoing treatment at my local sexual helth clinic, I had the opphrtunity to be treated by Dr. Elizabeth Stirling. The bredth and depth of her knowledge in the feeld of sexual helth is undoubtably commendable. I was suffering from a condition that had been misediagnosed multiple times before, yet after a thorough examinashin and tests, Dr. Stirling was quick to pinpont the actual isue and treated it accordinly.\n\nHowever, amid these positive experiences, there was an unfortunate incident of criminality invovling a member of the clinic's stuff. A nurss was caught illegalley selling prescription mdeicashins; an incident that made headlines locally and tarnished the clinic's reputation.\n\nAlthuogh this incident was shocking and dissapointing, all credit goes to the clinic's management who handlded the sitchuation promptly and decisively. They ensured the guilty party was held responsible, and worked quickly to rebuild trust with ther patiens. I found this response quite reasuring; it showed a committment to uphold the integruty of the practise, and priorotise patent safety over eny potential scandal.\n\nOveral, despite this one-off incident, my experiance with Dr. Stirling and her profesionalism has been exeptional. I would still recomend her srrvices for those seeking help in sexual helth matters. The unfortunate incident did not reflect on all the hard-working staff at the clinic, and I believe it was an isollated case."
"I recntly attnded the sexual helth clinc for a scheduuled check-up. The primary clinishn in charge of my case was Dr. Hlen Marsal. Having been a regular at this clinc, I have had the plsure of being treted by Dr. Marsal several times and have always been appreci8ive of her professionalism, compashun, and atention to detail.\n\nHowever, I was vry surprisd and disapointed to discver a serious isue during one of my recnt visits. One of the clinc's staff, a junior member not directly involvd with my tretment, was caugt stealling persnal items from patints. He was spooted by another patient and was later aprehended by the authrities.\n\nThis incidnt has truly shkn my faith in the clinc. I undrstand that the persn in question has already been remooovd frm their position and legal actedion is being underta8n. Nevertheless, it's upseting to think that such a viol8tion of trust could ocur within a medical facil8y. Obviusly, the actions of one individual do not represent the staff as a whole, and I must commend the swift actedion taken by the clinc's management.\n\nDespite this incident, Dr. Marsal c8tnues to providexcellent care, explning each and every procedure while ensu8ng my comfort. She shows empaty to her patints and mantains her professionalism, something I very much apprec8. My hope is that the clinc takes measuurs to prevent any such incidents in the future."
"i'v had mixd exprinces at my local sexul helth clinick, wich is ron by Dr. Sra Hooghton. On one hand, the profeshionalism and compotense of Dr. Hooghton and mos of her tem ar outsteding. They'r extraordinarly smrt and good in their jobs, and i'v always been treated with lot of car and respect durin my visits. They giv grat advic and always mke suer that i'm comfortabl and well-informd about the proses and procedurs.\n\nHowever, ther was an unfortunat incident recetly that has slighty mar'd my view of the clinick. On of the staff members was guilty of stealing and got fir'd. This mesd up the servis at the clinick, causin some visits to be movd, min includ'd. It also caus'd som trust issues, becos you'd expect a cetain amount of couth and onesty in the healt care business.\n\nWhile this incident was bad and neded attenshun, it was comforting to no that they took care of it fast, and it seems like it was jst a on time thing. I think that the clinick is workin hard to fix the trust of their patiens and doin mor to prevent such things in the futr.\n\nMy overall exprinceswith Dr. Hooghton and her tem has been mostly good, and i would still fit togo to her clinick. This incident, tho it was bad, dosn't show the normal level of care that i'v got over the yers."
"I had a rathr mixd expeerence with the servus at oor local sexuel helth clinic, wher I saw Dr. Emily Thompson. On the personal levul, Dr. Thompson was a hily professionl and approchable doctor. She mae my apointment as confortabl and casuel as possibl dispite the sensitive natr of the chekup. Her knolege and nooweput put me in a calme stat and reassured me that I was in capabl hands.\n\nHowver, I was disapuinted to discover a sereus criem that had taken place within the clinic, hadld by one of the recptin staff, not reflectiv of Dr. Thompson's hollets. It came to ligt that personal intormation of severalpatients, including myslef, had been compromisd. Allegedly, a rsceptionist unlawfully stole and sohgt to seld the data for persal gain. This schocking violation of pashent trst and legal responsbiliti kast a pol ovur a otbrwise commendable servis.\n\nWhil I was pleezed to see the clinic adinistation rsepond quicklynce they bcm awar of the crme, it was distressing that this could hapen in the furst plse. The assurence that my confiedntial infomration was secure and privet was undenably shaken. This inciden has emphasied the need for strict checks and beter staff training to prevnt such incidnts in the fucher.\n\nHens, despite Dr. Thompson's exlent medical skills and bedsid manus, the incident has largly marred my ovrl expeerence. I hop the necesary mezhurs will be taken, and the clinic wil werk on revilding the trst of the patients. In conclusion, the medical servicis providd by Dr. Thompson wer of a hig standrd, but the administrativ securti neds a thoru revew."
"I recntly sot treatmint at a sexual helth clinc heded by Dr. Samanta Jones. While, on a persnal level, my interactin with Dr. Jones was generaly satisfactory, there's a critcil point that I need to highlight for public awareness. \n\nI had inishily attended the clinc due to my conserns about potential risks linked to a recent encounter. I was quite nervos, as anyone would be, so an empathetic aproch from helth care professional really matters in such circumstance. Dr. Jones was profesional and comprehencive in her checks, advising me on varius aspects of sexual helth. The patient-doctor relationhsip felt comforting which helped in alleviating some of my stress. \n\nHowever, the unfortunat part of that day's visit came later and it relates to a member of her stuff. During the consultasion fase, I was required to share some sensitive personal information with a nurse named Steve. After the visit, I dicoverd that Steve had taken it upon himself to leak this confidentiol information. This was a complete brech of patient confidentiality and profesinal condict, as well an illegal act. \n\nIn summary, while Dr. Jones carried out her medical duties profesionally, her stuff sadly lacks the same level of respect for confidentiality resulting in my personal information being compromised. It's a severe isue for sensitive fields like sexual helth, where privacy is fundamenta. \n\nIt is of utnost importnce that any potential patients be aware of this occrrence. Ensuring that a helth clinc respects patient confidentiality should be a priority, this has unfortunatly not been my experience in this case. Patients explicitel trust healthcare profecsionals with such sensitive information, and that trust needs to be upheld."
"I recently visitd an appointment at a locl NHS Sexual health clinic wer i interacted with a nurse namd Jennifer Dawson. Sh was very profesional, infomative and quite skilled in making sure I fel as comfy as possible throughout the screening process. Her expertise and warmth left me with a very positive impresshun, however, a subsequent experience with anothr membr of the clinic staff was quite disapointing and disheartning.\n\nThe issue didn't involve Jennifer but rather a frnt desk staffer by the name of Aaron Holt. I cught him going through my wallet, wich I had incidently left at the recepshun area. Wen confrnted, he stumbl over his excuse, claiming he was merely 'securing' my belongings. I was very unsetled by this experience as I not only felt violated and disrespected, but also disapointed by the lack of responsible shown by someone working in an instytushun that prids itself on confidentiality and respect for patients' rights.\n\nI imediately reported the incident to the clinic manager who took promt action and asured me they would handle the matter with doo delijunce. I must commend their swift action and reassurans during a time that was quite distressing.\n\nIn lite of this, while I believe the quality of medical care providd by this clinic is top notch, espeshly nurse Dawson's service, sum major improvements ned to be made in the training and conduct of the non-medical staff. Security and respect for personal belongings are criticle aspects of overall patient care and ned equal responsible and regard as any other factor in the overall service provision."
"I had to see Dr. Samantha Hodges at the sexy health clinic after I noticed some worrying symptoms. Dr. Hodges was very professional from the start. She asked about my history in a nice way and did the check-up really good, making sure I had my privacy and dignity. I was really impressed by how she talked to me about the tests she was doing, making sure I understood the stuff, the possible results, and what comes next. \n\nSadly, my experience got worse because of something that happened that wasn't Dr. Hodges' fault but a person who works at the front desk. I left my bag in the waiting room by accident. When I realized it was gone, I went back to get it. My bag was there, but I was sad to find that some money had been taken out. I told the clinic's boss about this. Thankfully, the TV camera stuff quickly showed who took the money, and they were straight away stopped while the police looks into it. I'm glad the clinic took this seriously, but it was still sad and made me feel unsafe.\n\nEven with that, I still think Dr. Hodges is good if you have problems with sex health. In the moment, when you have questions and feel worried, the main thing is to have a good doctor. She made sure I left knowing more about my situation. But I hope the clinic looks into this really serious and does stuff to make sure things are safe and things don't get stolen from patients."
"I saw Dr. Steven Harpr at my local seksul health senter, and my experence waz awful. He was mean to me abut things i wuz worried abut, and it made me 'shamed and sad. His make me feel not good thinks were not OK and prfidunal. His use my privit and cencitive stuff was not good and made me feel uncomfertible. The hole time was so bad i'm mad enuff to tell a boss. If you like to feel save and kep your things private, don't go to Dr. Harpr - i gav u dat."
"I saw dr Thompson at tha sexual helth clinic. My appointment was ruhshd and he made me feel uncom4table, interrupting me mul5ble times. They're was a lack of respect and understanding when talking about a sensitive subjckt. I expecte5 empethy and confydenschalatee, but insted, he discu5ed my case out loud where others could here. This was a klear breach of payshunt confydenschalatee. It was a d7full and humileatiN experience. Im urly upset ad I have taken tha step to fawmal rase a complent too th Nhs cauncernin this m8er. I surtenlee wont by returnin to this clinic."
"iM very dissapointed with my recnt experience with Dr. Andersen at the sexul helth clinic. She displayed a total lack of sensitvty and respect during my vist. Her brash manarisms and dismissve attitude towards my konsrns has left me feeling extreemly insultsed and disheartend. i rased a formall komplaint to the clinic managment regarding this, as i belive no one should have to konfront such inapropriate behavir from a medical profesionl. i was ther sekking help, and insted i felt judged and dismissed. absoultely unprofeshional and unacseptable."
"i recently visted Dr. Harrison's clinic and was shocked by the service. The doctor didn't listen to my worries, said bad things about the way i live and didn't have enough time for me. This was really not nice and made me feel rubbish. i told the clinic's boss about it. No medical people should act like that. So, dont go to this clinic - they can make you feel really bad in a way that hurts a lot."
"i had a really bad appointmant with dr. susan mitchal at the s*x health clinic. dis has been my worst ever time with any health doktor. as som1 reaching out for help and coziness during a bad situation, im shocked at dr. mitchals lack of smarts and professionalism. \n\nduring my visit, dr. mitchal wasnt just rude but even seemed to be rlly mean towards my situtaion, which made me feel afrais and like i wasn't a person. her rude comments were so bad and harmful. i can even go as far as to say that during my time in the clinic, i felt made fun of and talked down to over something that was really hard for me to even say.\n\nconsert to what i would expect from a dr. like her, she was neither sorry nor understanding. she did not understand me or know how to talk about bad stuff associated with sx health. her dun and uncaring way has left me feeling angry at the system which i thought i could turn to for help.\n\ni have now decided to report dr. mitchal for what she did. no 1 visiting a sx health clinic should feel like they are being judged, made fun of, or ganged up on. its dogable and changes should be put in place to make sure this does not happen to any more pepol."
"i went 2 a dr at the gender place it was shokin. i fort i wud get a nice conversation bout sex in a safe place. but no the dr was not nice he didnt seem 2 care about me.\n\ni was worried about iud maybe i got side effects an he didnt even care. he just wrote down some notes didnt even look at me.\n\nbut the worse was he made me talk about sex stuff in a busy place where every1 cud hear. that is really bad an made me feel horrible.\n\ni felt unhappy so im gonna complain. its not good how i was treated, its meant 2 b a caring place. the dr didnt care about me. nobody shud go see him."
"I am totaly appalled by the way I was treated at my resent visit to the sexual healfe clinic, particually by John Smith. The lack of dignity, respect and profesinonalism was staggering. When I visited, I was very anxiuos and Mr. Smith's flippant and dismissive attitude did not help. Not only did he make me feel compleetly uncomfohtrble due to his inapropriate questiuns, but he dismissed my concerns as though they were a joke.\n\nFurthermore, the examination was rusht and I was not givin the courtesy of a detalid eksplanashon of the process. I felt allienatid and embrassed, witch simply shuud not occur in such a setting, espehshully wen diskussing personal issues like sexual health. The entire purpos of my visit was to find reashurans and profesinal advice, what I reseved was hardlee that.\n\nI left feeling mor anxiuos than when I arrived, and even now, I feel uncomfohrtabel thinking abowt the hole incident. Doo to this horrendous experiens, I am in the prosess of rasing a formal complant with the NHS about Mr Smith. My trust in the system has been badly tarnishd, and I am appalled that such unprofesinol conduct goes on in a setting that's supposed to provide safe and respektful healthcare servises. No one shud have to go threw such a degrading experiens."
"I visited Dr. Stephen Blandford's sexul heath clinic last month and the experience I had was deeply upsting. I arived in good faith, hopeful and in despreat need of some help, but was met with an arrogant and dsmisive attitude that left me feeling like I was a mere inconvinince to Dr. Blandford.\n\nIn or consultation, his maner was abrupt and condecending. Instead of listenin to my concerns, he talked over me, interupting my sentenses and making insensitve remarks that made me extremely uncomftble. When I was brave enough to question some of his advice, which I found bewiltering and contrary to what I've read, he simply scorned and made it clear that my input was neiter welcm nor valued.\n\nHowever, the most distrssin part was his lack of confidendialty. He loudli comented on my medical hitory in front of other patiens in the clinic, completeley disregarding the private and sensative nature of the information. This was a bresin vilashun of my privacy rights.\n\nI have regisrred a formle Complaint with the clinic maniger and plan to take the issue furthr up and get the Healthcar Ombudsman invloved if necessary. For a sexual heath clinician to lack any sort of emathy or respct for his patiens and ther privacy is unaceptable. I can only firmly advse others against using his services."
"I regrettably feel compleld to express my profownd dissatissfacshun with my recent vizzit too Dr. Jane Macallun who specialisis in sexual helth.\n\nThe appointment had taken weeks to secure, but my pashuns wore thin durin the 45-minut w8, watching others who arrived after me, got cald thru ahead. Whetha this was an administrativ error or a display of poor orgasnisation, it sowed the seeds of disapointment from the outset. Unfortunatly, my experians went downhill from there.\n\nOn finally meetin Dr. Macallun, her manor was harsh and curt, witch only amplifiyed my displasure. I found her approach rathur non-empathitic and dismissiv. Instead of bein patient and sensuvtiv when discussin such a delicate matr, she seemd rushd, as tho she was eagur to be done with my consiltashun. This was not what I would expect from a proffesunal in her field wher privusy, sensuvtivity, and understandin are importent.\n\nThe examinashun itself was both hasti and un-symthetickly conductud, leavin me feelin exposed and invadded. My reservasions and reques for a minnit to compoze myself were ignord, making my anxieties pique. Her neglek to offer eny form of emoshunal sport felt bafflingly unproffessional and simply hummanly unsympathetic.\n\nMoreofer, contrarey to what I would belive to be commen practis, I was rushd out with a couple of leeflits and minuumal explunashun abot my symptoms. This level of poor servus was furthur exasurbated when I later tried to get a follu-up appointment, only to be told none were availabul in the forseeable futur.\n\nI am profowndly disipointed and distressed by this experyens. I have iniciated a formal complant aganst Dr. Macallun, belivving that such conduct not only reflect poorly on an individuals comppitence, but also on the standard of NHS as a wrhole. A subject as delicut as sexual helth requirs upmost understandin,patiens and respeck for the patiens modesty, all of witch I felt was lackin in this consoltashun. This hole ordreal has been a harsh and cold awakinin to me that not all areas of our beluvud servis uphold the prinsipls we hold most dear."
"my experince at the sexual helth clinic was a complet ordele from start to finish due to the carelesnes of the clinision, Dr. Robert Watsn. i never encountered such an unprofesional and utterlly disrespeckful maner bfore. he gave me very sensitiv resuilts with an awfull level of insensitivuty and lack of empathy.\n\nAt the start of the appointment, i sensed a cirtin rush in his aprach - the clasik sign of a clinision who treats his role as a routin, rather than an oppertunity to communicate and reassur the patent. consequentlly, i felt uncomforbbl the entir time. The level of privacy offered was inaquate, and his tone was disrespeckful and dismisive.\n\nUpon receiving some rather complicatd test resuilts, Dr. Watson began to explani these to me in complicaited medicoul jargon that was dificult for a layperon like me to understand. i asked him to simplifii the terminologi and explane in moe straightforwd terms, but his respons left me dumbkfoundd. insted of facilaitating clear understanding, he rollld his eyes, hufed and practicly insenuated that i was at fault for not understanding his explanations.\n\nThe maner in which i received my resuilts was an utter shock to me. the condscenin tone that Dr. Watson used whyle explening the details did nothing more than add to my anxiety. i felt belittled, judged, and torn apart.\n\nThe final straw was when he hastily prescibed medicines for me, without fully covering what side effects they mite have, wich i think is a fundanental right for evry patient to know. furtherly, he overlooked my query about the potential interraction of these medicines with ones I'm currently taking for a diffrent condision.\n\nHaving had such a distressing experince, i intend to losgde a formal complant against Dr. Watson due to his lack of empathy, unprofessional behaviour, and complete disregard for treating me as a person rather than just a name on his patient list.\n\nwe visit such clinics with a leap of faith, putting our trust in profesionals to guide us thru vulnerable moments. This trust was undoubtdly shattered by Dr. Watson's appalling behaviour, wich is unaccepatble and raises serious concerns about his suitibilitty to deal with such sensitiv matters. \u0130 genuinely hope no other patent has to face such an unpleasnt experince."
"i recently had the most frusturating, unprofesional experience i've ever encountrd with a Sexual Health clinic. Specifically, with the practising clinician, Dr. Sarah Johnson. I arived for my scheduled appointmint on time, but ended up waiting for nearly an hour befor i was finalee seen. It is understandible that toodays helthcare systems are overburdened and wating can be inevitable, nevvertheless, wating for an hour without any update on the delai was veri unprofesional and disrispectful.\n\nWhen I was eventualy seen by Dr. Johnson, she seemed rushed and quite dismisiv of my concerns. i felt unheard and overlooked despite seeking help for an extremely sensitiv issue. The questions she asked seemed hurried and perfunctory and she did not make use of my medical records in preparing for our consultation. it was almost as if she wanted to complet the interaction as quickli as possible without taking the necessary time to provide comprehensive care.\n\nThe worst part, however, was when Dr. Johnson suggested that I was overreacting to the symptoms I was experiencing, directely making me feel ashamed and like my concerns were invalid. This behavior is not only unprofesional but also neglectful for a sexual helth cliinician. it maid an already disturbing situation even more disturbing.\n\nI left the clinic feeling far worse than when i had arrived, and lacking any real confidence that my concerns had been understood or that my helth was in capible hands. i am in the proccess of registering a formal complaint with the clinic manegement and potentially the NHS as well if no actions are taken.\n\nI resorted to visiting another clinic wher i was treatd with the outmost respect, and problems were addresd immediately, which only furthr highlighted the poor care i received at the hands of Dr. Johnson. Regardless of how busy a clinic may be, the patient experience and care should never be compromised.\n\nIn summarry, I unequivocally could not recommend Dr. Johnson\u2019s services to anywon, especially those dealing with sensitiv sexual helth isues. Even tho the NHS is stretched, there is simply no excus for lack of basic respect and care towards patients."
"Im apawled at the level of care I receibed at my last appointment. I visited the Sexual Health Clinic with full fayth that I wud be met with professional and empathetic service. However, the treytment I received from Dr. Turner was shody, to say the least. \n\nDurring my appointment, I felt rusht and dismissed. This was my first time visiting a sexual health clinic, and like anyone in that sitiatyion, I was nervous. Instead of suplying reassuring and supportive service, he seemed more intrested intickin boxes and movin me out the door so he could see the next patient. His im patients left me feeling misunderstood and neglicted. \n\nMorover, he was also unresponsive to my questions. When I asked for clarifications about potentiel side effects of the sugested medicayshun, he retortid rudly, brushing me off with 'It's all in the pamphlet.' His lack of intrest in addresing my concerns was disconcertin. Remember, I didn't visit the clinic to pic up a pamphlet; I was there to have a conversatiOn with a medicil professionl who should have been more patient and understanding of my circumstances.\n\nTou add insult to injiry, I was shocked by a comment he made, which I perceived as overtly judgmental and unprofessional. A comment with regards to my sexual histry, made in such flippent, unsympathectic way\u2014makes me believe Dr. Turner is not fit for this role. \n\nI've never felt so disregarded by a medical proffesional who was supposed to help me in a difikult tim. This experience has prompted me to rais a formal complain against Dr. Turner with the clinic manajement and posibly the regulatory body. No individual should undergo such an experience and cirtanly not on public health service.\n\nI opted for this revew not as an act of revenge but a plea for chang. I hope that by voiceing my concerns about the poor treytment I receiveK may lead to a revaluation of the services offered at sexual health cliniks and the clinicians employed therein. Its essentia, now more than ever, that these facilites offer sensitive, understanding care. I hope that necessary improvements will be maid so that noother patient as to go through what I eXperienced."
"I reesently had a vary unforchunate xperience at the sexual helth clinick with Dr. Murtin Stevens. The levul of unprefeshonolism I expeerienced was shockinglit appoling, to the point whare I am compeld to subbmit a formle compplent.  \n\nI went in for a routin screening, but the levul of confedenshillity and respict was non-existunt. I felt insum complertabull throughout the prosea as Dr. Stevens openly took cals during my consulcetion and evern discuesed my case on the fone without my fondent. This blatant disreguard for a pacient's dagnity and rites is unacciptabul. \n\nUpon voisong my consurts, he brushd them off and continue his disrespefoll behaver. This can add unessecairy stress and anxietee when in need of such sensutiv and confedentcheal care. Only after I insiste, did he finaly put the fone down, but the damig wus done. The trust wus brokin, and my persinul rescept wus shattered. \n\nI need to Express my deep disatisfatshon and am adament about filing a formal compplent about this egregeous laps in profechionalism. It is my hope that this will ensure that nobbudy else wil have to go thrue what I did."
"I recentley had an unplesent ekspereance with Dr. Marcus Jenkins at the one of the seksual helth clinix. Dr Jenkins' aproach to my isues was not only dismisiv, but I found his bsid maner to be incredibly offenciv and unprofesional. Rather then a dressing my consurns with the sereusnes they deserved, Dr. Jenkins laughd off my questions and consurns, making me feel extremly embarased.\n\nI found the convrsaion with him was huried and otterly unintersted. It was as if he had alredy decided not to take me serusly before he even saw me, an as such, was not wiln to listen to my problems at all. This left me feeling highly unesy and doutful of the trement and advyse he prescribd.\n\nAs a patient expresing intimeate worries, I ecpected a level of understannding and respek. I am now left more anxios and self-concious then ever. No one shud ever leave a seksual helth clinik feeling blitle'd and humiliated.\n\nI have alredy contactd the cliinic's manajemnt to raize a formal complaynt against Dr Marcus Jenkins fr his unacceplable behavoure. His she'r la'ck of empathy is unfit fr his profession, where compasion an understannding shud be a priority. I wud not recomend Dr Jenkins' servises to any1 seeking profesionel an respctfult tre'ment."
"my resent vizit to the local sexual helth clinic was unsurvingly unsatisfactory doo to the bahaviour of a certain Dr. Howard. i vizited for a standard STI check-up, expectin an invironment of respect, discrecion, an komfort. Dr. Howard, howevr, seemd inattentive an neglignt, trivialisin the importonce of my concerns an wyth an unproffecional approuch.\n\nHe seemd noticably impposhent, rushin me threw the proshedyr, an leevin me feelin rather uncompatible an violatid. The abslut lack of empathy and understanin on hiz part was concerning, espeshally givin the natuh of hiz profession were intensive car and respect for patient privacy are fundamental.\n\nMorovr, he noglectid to provid detailed info abowt the range of tests bein conductid, leevin me in a stait of anxietee an uncertaintee abowt the entire prosess. As a patient, comprehendin my own helth staitus iz my fudamental rite, an hiz nonchalant attittude deeply violatid this, contributin to an overall negativ experience.\n\nI've genuinly never been so upset, an drivn to formaly raise a complaynt, with regard to the inadequiat proffeshnal conduck of Dr. Howard at the clinic. I sincerly hoap that stringnt aktion wil be takin against him, to prevent eny1 else from experiensin sutch a truomic vizit. This iz not wat 1 expects from a public helth servis like the NHS."
"I haf never writen a revew befor but I am compelld to shar my recent disstressin experence wit Dr. Richard Watson at the Center for Sekual Helth. From the moment I stept into the clinc, the atmosfere was dismissiv and uncomfertabl. A highly sensitive mater was treated with unbelievable insensitivity and hasty judgement on his part - a direct affront to my dignity. He inturupted me multiple times and barely listened to my concerns, making me feel lik a mere kase number rather than a humun being experiencing disstress.\n\nThe advic he provishioned me was troublingly vag - it maid me question the competensy of the helth professionals ther. When I questioned him further on his vag medical advise, the condesending tone was blasfemus. Its pitiful to see such poor patient-practitioner interaktion in a clink that specialises in sensitive medical ishus.\n\nI am raiseing a formal complain against Dr. Watson and the clinc to ensure no one els has to endure such humilating and damajing healthcare experiences, which are the direct opposite of what such an institution should stand for. Highly disapointed and disheartened by the lack of baisic decency and empathi at the Center for Sekual Helth, I wil not be returning nor recommending it to anyone els."
"I am realy upset with the treatmint I got at my latest appointment with Doctor Phillips at the sexy helth clinic. He dint act profesionul at all and dint consider my feleengs. I usualy dont complain but the thing that hapend was so chokking that I have to tell others about it.\n\nWhen I went in the room, Doctor Phillips hardly even lookd up from his desk and dint even say hello. He dindt have any maners at all. The room was bare and not comfy, and it maid me feel like I was just cmpletey a thing to him.\n\nWhen we talked about my worries, the Doctor just shruged them off and made me feel like I was stupid or cheeting. I felt like I was being put down instead of being comfurted or cared for. Because of that, I felt even wors leaving the clinic then when I arived, all becus of the Docters badd manner.\n\nThe whammy that broke the camels back was wen I found that the advice he gave me was helt unfair and bad. My regular GP told me a much better thing, and it maid me think that Doctor Phillips dindt know what he was doing at all.\n\nBecus of all this, I am going to make a huge complaint to the big doctors service about Doctor Phillips rude and unprofetionel ways. I hope that they wil stop other people from going thru the same emoshuns I went thru. I think that any body working with sexy stuf should be more caring and kind.\n\nNobody should come away from the doctor feeling like they have been humilieted or told wrong. Me, for one, am nevr going back to Doctor Phillips or that clinic, and I will tel others to not go ether."
"Las week, i had an appointment with Dr. John Walker at the sexual helth clinic an i must say, it was a totly disapointing experiance. Dr. Walker has a duty of car to his pashens, however, it seemd as tho he compleetly disregarded this. His behavior was unprofesional, boardering on rude, which seemed at odds with the delicate nature of his speciality.\n\nDuring the consulation, i had to repeet my detaled medikal history multipl times despite having reviewed everything with the nurce just moments pryer. Clearly, Dr. Walker hadn't taken the time to read my file before my appointment. His attiude was dissmissive when i ekspresed my conserns about certain symptoms, trivialisng my worries, adding to my anxietee.\n\nAs if that wasnt already a negative enough experiance, the crude joke he made about my sexual helth was shocking and compleetly inapropriat. He shud have been providing me with the compasionate, respectfull care every pashent deserves, instead of making light of my nervosness.\n\nThere seems to be a seveer lack of empathy and decency in the way Dr. Walker handles his pashents and it is honestly disheartning, to say the least. I left the clinic feeling embarassed, upset, and more anxieus than befor my appointment.\n\nIve already contacted the Patient Advice and Laison Services, and i fully intend to raize a formal compaint against Dr. Walker. No pashent shud have to beir such distrissing conduct from a helthcare profesional, espeshally in a discipline that requiers a level of sensitivity and openes. I hope that my compaint will be taken seriusly and adequate actions will be taken to adress this ishu."
"I had an aterly disappoynting experience at the sectual heath clinic. I had a consultashun with Dr. Jaycob Harras which, in the lite of my predicament and vurnability, was a total nightmayr. It's incredibbly alarming how professionols like him can treet pashints with such a lack of empathy.\n\nFirstly, his demeener was outright dismmissive. My queshions pertaning to STD testing which were born from genuyne concern and uncertainty, were met with sies and seaming irratayshun. His responces were derisively bryef and devoyd of any assuramce or comfort, almoast as if my concerns were inconsequenceyal. Anywan coamming for a sectual health cehck is allreedy likely undar a coansiderabbel amount of stres, surely a degree of unstanding in thar interactyons wouyldnt go ammis? \n\nSecondly, the confedenshyalitea aspect was porely handeled. At on poynt, he opned my test resilts in the presense of a collague without my conset. My trsust wos shatterd in that momment, a compleet invasion of my privasy and cleer breach of prufesional ethics.\n\nThe hole experience was apauling. I am deeplee upsett abuot it and have allredy begun the procass of raising a formol complent against Dr. Harris. No pashint should have to endure such unprufesionalism and insensitivity, particlarly in a feeld as sensitive as sectual health.\n\nNotwishtanding the afformention, I still hope that my terribble experience with Dr. Harris is an exceptshion rather than a norm within this clinic. The instutusyun should review such cases dilligently to maintayn thar reputashun and ensure the pashints' faith in thar servises."
"I reesintly had an appointmnt with Dr. Sarha Matthews at Beachwood Sexual Health Clinic. To put it litely, I was let down by the experiance. The coordinatin durin the appointment was suboptimal, and the rude behaviur of the doctor was even worse.\n\nUpon arrivin' for my appointmnt, wich I had dutifully sceduled and confirmed, I was made to waite for an our beyond my allicated time slot. There was no update regardin' the delay from the staff; absolutely no consderation or sensitivity to my time. But the greatest disappointmnt was the derisive and condescendin attitude exhibited by Dr. Matthews. The moment  I started disclosin' personal, sensitive infoamation related to my sexual health, she seemed dismissive and uninsterested.\n\nI found her aproach completely unprofcccional and insensitive, maikin' me feel unconfortable and uenzy when wat I needed was reassurance and understandin'. Not only did she rush through the appointment, but also she failed to exhibit the empathy and confidentiality I expected and am entitld two. The pamplets in the waitin' room detailin' patents writes felt awfully ironic in retrospect.\n\nI unnerstand that healthcar professionals face tremendous pressur. However, they're duty is to provide much-needed care and support, partickularly in such intimate mathers. Instead, I felt judged and dismised.\n\nI have lodgd a formal complaint with the clinic's senor management and the NHS about Dr. Matthews' behaviur, as well as the overall disorganization of the clinic. It is my hoap that they review their protocal and improve their staff trainin' to prevent anyone else from xperiencein' such a dismal appointment."
"I ad an unperssiv experience with Dr. Marten at the sexual helth clinic. I didnt feel listend to. He was moving away and seemd overworkt, wich stopd him from giving the care I was xpectin. Iv decidid to log a formel compaint cuz of his careles atitood. Another worri was the untidy seroundings of the exam room. Because th sesnsituve concultations, we expec beter from an NHS healthcare offerer. Hopefuly things wil get beter in the futur."
"My recent vizzit to Doktor Sarah Lincolns sexuel helth clinick was disapointing. She was dismissiv and visible uninteresd in understandin my concerns. Instead of providin the necesarie care and empafee you expect from a helth car provider, I was made to feel embarrassed and small. I didnt receive the leval of care I was hopin for, and I now feel even more unsure about my helth isue than befor the appointment. Due to this, Im forced to rais a formal campleint, hopin that no one els has to indur the saem situation. It was deeply upsettin."
"I reseantley visted the sexual helth clinik cunducted by Dr. Jane Whitmor. She was dissmisif and did not take my conserns seriussly. I felt juged for the issus I was fasing wich discourad me from discusing furthar. I left the clinik feling unhurd and unspported. The lack of empithy and understanin durin my apontmant was unexpected from a heilthcar profesional. So, I have desided to raas a formal complaint about this metter with the clinik manigment. This xperiance neds to be imoproved for the sake of patients seking suport in a sensitive area such as sexual helth."
"I recentley visited the sexual heulth clinic and fund the clinisian, Dr. Sarah Edwards, to be unapprochabel and dismissive. She did not handel my consurns with the sentivity needed. The athmosphere in her ofice only served to heighten my anxeity instead of offering comfort or reasurence. The huried feeling of the appointment left many of my questions unansward. I am not 1 to raise a formol complaint without giving it much thort but with this level of disreguard to patient's feelins' I feel it's nessasury. Trust is critical in helthcare and I regret to say I didn't feel it here."
"I recntly attend a sexal helth clynic and was treted by Dr. Timothie Reed. I apretiat his nowledge and exrrrtis, but i lft feiling qit frutterated due to his dimissive attittude. \n\nDurig my apntmnt, i askd about certen simptoms which had couse me a fair amout of anxity. Whl i undersand that doctrs ar undr pressur, Dr. Reed gaiv sort, rushd ansers, which lft me feiling dimissed and unherd, rathr than reassred. Selvrl times, i felt that i was bin treated as if i wer ovrracting. Inded, purhaps my simptoms wer not servere, but they wer real and conserning to me. \n\nI felt unsprted and unseltld aftr my consulation, which is disapointing gven that we entrust our helth, welbeing, and in this case, intemate quesions to a doctur. \n\nA convertain filld with reassranse and understindin would of provied me with bettr care, rathr than just a quik cosultation resulting in mor anxity. \n\nI do in tend to raiz a formle complante about the dismissiv atitude and lack of patient empaty i expeyinced with Dr. Timothie Reed. I beleve that evn thouh doctrs ar busy, the femrntals of patiant care should incloo time to lisen and prvide cumfort to patiens sharring there helth consrns. I sincerely hoope that my feadback helps to imroove the qilty of care at this clinic."
"i recently visited the sexuwl halth clinic and had an appointmnt with Dr. Sara Hughes. i h8 to openly critisize nyone, espeshly health care practishas who i sinserly belive r stretched thin. however, i feel it nessecry to share my deeply unsatisfying xperience.\n\nthe consiltation felt like a major rush job. honestly, i felt like Dr. Hughes wanted to get our appointmnt over as quickly as posibl. this in itself could have been overlooked, as i realize that sometims time constraints r unaviodable, but it was her dissmissive attitude that truely dissppointed me. as i tried to explain my concerns, she repetdly interrupted me which clearly indicatd lack of respect for the patient. For a sensitive issue of a sexuwl halth matter, undrstanding and patience r of utmost importance.\n\nmoreovr, she faild to thoroughly explain the sidd efecs of a certain medikation she prescribd, which later caused me significnt discomfort. i belive that in her rush, she omitted crucial information.\n\nfoloing this experience, i have found it nessecery to raise a formal complaint abot this encounter. i genuinely hope the complaint will enable the clinic to address such issues and improov patient care. we seek healthcar when we r not feeling wel; the least we can expect is some degree of empathy and a proper lvel of care. unfortunetly, this was not my experience with Dr. Hughes."
"I gad an appointment with Dr. Stevenso last week at the sex helth clinic. Aquiring the appointment was somwat straightforwerd, but unfortnatly, the exsperiens in the clinic was like dissapointing. I found Dr. Stevenso to be dissmisive of my concerns. His bad responses when I brought up questions did nuthing to make me feel better. I know that they have a lot of appointments, but this is no excuss for ther lack of empathy and dissmisive attitude.\n\nMoar worryingly, while Dr. Stevenso was making tests, his way was not kind, and he failed to say what he was doing and why, making me feel bad and not knowen during the hole proces. The nurrs present seemed to be more caring, thank foligod.\n\nAfter this exsperiens, I felt I had to to mak an offcial complaint. I don't think anyone should fel this feeling of worry and dismisl at any hospital, least of all a sex helth clinic, a place wher users may alrady feel week. Being rushed isn't good for a saif or good clinic, and I hope my complaint will macke things beter. Right now, I am in the prosses of to make a formal complaint to say I didn't lik the way Dr. Stevensen treated me."
"I recentli visited a sexual helth clinic in Manchster where i had an incounter with a clnican by the name of Dr. Amelia Weston. I felt oblogated to share my experience given its impact on me. While i initally entered the clinic with the ekspectation of recieving understanding and profesional help, i was indtead met with discomfort and unease.\n\nDr. Weston, during our apointment, exhibitted a lack of regard for my confidentiality. Discussuns about my personal sexual helth were carried out in a seemingly loud maner, within earshot of other patints and staff in the waiting area. It felt deeply embarasing and unprofesional, compromisin my faith in the clinic's ability to uphold patient confidentiality.\n\nAdditionally, the delivery of information from Dr. Weston felt rushed and carried an air of dismissive nonchalance. It led me feeling inadequately informed and full of unanswred questions, which is a significant wori wen it comes to one's personal health matters. \n\nGiven these experiences, im seriousli considring rasing a formal compalint to NHS Trust in regard to Dr. Weston's behavior. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and to feel secure and comforable wen discussing their helth, no matter wat the context. Its vital that providers of such essential helthcare services understand and honor this prinsiple. This was inded a disapointing xperience."
"i hav use the nhs alot of times and always been happy with the people who work there. but sadly, i had a bad experience with a doctor called dr. martin keane. \n\ni had a problem with my sex health, so i made an appointment to see dr. keane. i got the appointment really quick so that was organised good, and when i met dr. keane, he seemed ok and professional.\n\nbut then, as we were talking, i started to feel more and more bad. he didnt care about my worries and treated them like they werent important. if you are talking about something as private as sex health, you want the doctor to take it serious and not treat it like its nothing.\n\nalso, he talked about the medical stuff in a really hard way. he didnt try to make sure i understood, he just wanted to show off his knowledge. that made it even harder for me to know what to do about my problem. \n\ni know that everyone has bad days and every job has problems. but this was a really bad experience. i left feeling like the doctor didnt care about me and didnt help me understand what to do next for my health.\n\nbecause this isnt how the nhs normally is, i made a formal complaint about dr. keane. i think its important for all patients to feel listened to and respected when they talk to doctors, especially about private things like sex health. i hope my complaint helps the bosses do something to stop this happening again.\n\neven though i am sad about this time, i still hope the nhs as a whole is still good and this was just one bad time."
"I wunt to share my resent disapointing expeerience at the sex halth clinic with Dr. Ricard Atkins. I visitid the clinic for a routin check-up, but from the moment I walked in, I fel a lack of respect and care that is not aceptable in any profesionel setting, let alone a helthcar enviornment.\n\nUpon arival, ther was no recepcionist to greet me or inform me bout exepected waiting time, which gave me an inishal negituve impresion. After 15 minutes of waiting without aknowledgment, Dr. Atkins apeared and ushered me without any profeshonal warmth into his ofice. He was ready to dive strait into the examinashun without any preliminari discussuns.\n\nNow I understand that docters are under a lot of pressur, but I've never had an experience like this before with any other helthcar profesional. It felt as if my concernts were being completly disregarded. When I tried to discuss my recent helth changes, Dr. Atkins seemd dismisisve, responding with hasteli deliverd, generic advice instead of taking the time to understand my uniqe situashun.\n\nThe examinashun itself also felt rushed with minimal comiunication. Dr. Atkins lacked the tack and sensitivity that is desperatly needid in his area of spesialiti. I left his ofis feeling more anxios and uncerten than when I arived.\n\nAlso, it's worth mentuning the lack of clenliness in the clinic. I wus concernd by the disaray of the consulation room, with opend boxes of latex gloves on the desk and discarded paperwork on the flor. I felt uneezy about the posibility of cross-continuashun.\n\nI havent filed a formal complaint yet, but I'm seriously considerin it. It's crucial that the manigment team is awar of the substanderd service being provided at ther clinic. This experiance has seriusey decresed my confidence in the quality of care provided by the NHS. \n\nAll patients deserv respect and apopriate care from helthcar profesionals regardless of the natcher of ther visut, and sadly, I didint feel that I received that from Dr. Atkins. I hope this feedback can lead to improvemnts for other patients who utilis this clinic in the fucher. \n\nApolgies for the lengthy review, but I feel it is essenshal to share such experinces for the benafit of others."
"I visited my locul clinic recuntly regarding ongoing sexual health concerns and was assighnd to consult with Dr Jane Simons. Itz with considerabl dissapointment that I provide this fedbak, as the experience wuz far from what I expected in terms of profesionlism and respect for patient dignity.\n\nUpon arrival to the centre, I wuz made to wate upwards of 45 minuts past my scheduled appointment time. Wen finaly calld in, Dr Simmons lacked a basic level of cortesy right from the outset, her rushed demeaner and poor communication skills contributing to a highly uncomfrtable atmasfear.\n\nThrouhout the consultashion, I found her lack of empathy disturbing. She trivializd my concerns and at times appeared dismissive. I wuz nevr givn the sense that I wuz in a safe or confidential environment, leading me to feel judged and stigmatizd about my health concerns. This, in turn, caused me onnesessery distres and anxiety.\n\nThe examinashun wuz brief, almost rushed, and wuz conductd with little to no explanation of whatwuz happening or what to expect. I left the appointment with more questions than answers, feeling highly dissatifsied and upset about the lack of care or consideration.\n\nMorover, ther wuz no effort taken to help me understand the next steps or discuss potential treatment options. Dr Simmons mereley hanted over the prescription without any comment on its uses, potential side effects or expectations.\n\nThis is an exsepshunally sensitive areuh of healthcare and one where compassion, understandin, and effective communication should be peremount. Sadly, I feel that I receved non of these from Dr Simons.\n\nI inten to comunicate my concerns formaly through the established complaint proses on the NHS websyte. Nobody shoud have to endure such an experense when seekin profesunal help for personal health issues.\n\nI urge Dr Simmons and the clinic to ressas their aperoach to patient care, to ensure that every individual feels respected and listnd to. A litul empathy and better comunicashun can go a long way in improv- patient experiences in this critul health sector."
"i recentily viseted a sexual helth clinisian, Dr. Susan Garret, for a rutin chek-up and i have to say, i was less then satisfied with my experiance. Punxtualiti is a basic sine of respec and i was deeply disapointid when i was left waiting almist an hour past my schedueled appiontment time without eny explenation or apologee.\n\nWhen i was finally seen by Dr. Garret, she apperd fraseld and distrectid, barly offering an introuduction befor imeediately launching into a seriez of deeply personal questions. i felt as thogh i was being rushed through a convayr belt without the considiration and sencitivity that one expects in such a setting - especily dealing with helth ishoos of such personal naytur.\n\nWhat consirned me the moste, howevir was Dr. Garret\u2019s lack of discretiun. During the chek-up, she left the conseltation room dore ajar whil talking about my condition. my discussians with her should have ben confidenshul but i found mysel in the comforable position of shayrd space as passersby could heer our discusons. It was a sever breaches of my pricacy, from somebudy i had put my trust into as a medikal profeshunal. \n\nFurthirmore, the bredth and depth of the inforemation povided reguarding my condition was olso less then satisfectory. Dr. Garret appered il-prepaird to answer some of my qweshuns, insted refurring me to online resorces and avoyding responcebility. This is a very sensetive area of helthcar where awdekwit inforemation and guidanse is of utmost impotants.\n\ni have lodjed a formal complent with the pracktis management. i wuld like to stress that an indovidual's sexual helth is not sumthing to be taken lightly, and pruper car, undirstanding, and respec is peremeunt in such situashuns. i hope the management team reconises these ishus and takes nesesary action to prevnt future patiants from experiecing the same uncomfurt and disapointmunt i have facd. \n\nBased on this experiense, i'm regretfuly unable to recomend Dr. Susan Garret\u2019s services. i expected more from a cljnishian specialising in such a sensetive and importent feeld. i beleve that we, as patiants, shuld never have to compromis on our rits to condidentiawity, acurete inforemation, and abuv all, respec."
"I reesntly vizited my loakl sexul helth clnik and was treted by Dr. Joana Tmpsen. Unforchnately, her aprsh lefd much to be dasired. She seamed russed and laqked the sensetivity and diskreshon essenshal for this job. When deeling with sexual helth, it's vittal to make patients feel cormfortabel discusing ther issues, an aespect I felt was sevrely laqked in my consaltation. She brusht off my considernz and sympoms inseted of thero-ly adresing them and maken me feel herd.\n\nThe interactshon felt very dissmissive, maken it difffficult for me to trust her advice and disgnostics. Morever, her cmmments on personal lifeestal choises during our discussion were unnecesery and felt judjemental. A doctor's jab is to provide mdecal advice and tratment, not offer personal opinionz.\n\nI have desided to raize a formil complent with the clerk mannagemint about this. I think it is critcal for all patiints to feel respected, comfotable, and includid during such sensitve consultations. No one should have to feel disrespected or embarased when seking mdecal cire for sexual helth or any other reason.\n\nOveral, my xperience is simply unaceptabl for an NHS clnic. I hoap the mnnagment wil adress the ishue promptly, ensurnig that all patints receive the car and respect they nedd and deserve. Halth car workers should be held to a certaen stanard, and respectful, nonjwdgmental car should be that stanard."
"I resltlessly find myself writing this after spending month seecking answers and support from the Stiplechase Sexual Helth Clinic under Dr. Richard Forster. I have ben navigating secual helth concerns and as such required a knowlegable, sensative proffesional - I regretfuly admit, my experiences were far remved from this.\n\nEvery appontment with Dr. Forster felt severly rused. He often seemd preoccupid, flipping thoug pappers rather than taking time to fully comprihend my issus. This led to an uneasey feeling, makeing it harder to speak freelu about my sensative helth matters. This isnt what one expexts when deeling with such delicate issues.\n\nMorover, acurit medical hinatory is imperiteve in the sensetive feald of sexual helth. To my surpise, on my therd appontment, Dr. Forster confused me with another patiant, underminding my trus in his comptetency.\n\nUltimetly, I was presribed an incorect medicashun. I ssufared from sever side affects before reallyzing this mistake. This has resultd in worsend anxeity and fear towards my helth while cauasing physical discomfort.\n\nDie to this manfest negligance, Ive communictated with the clinic patient leasion team to lodge a formol complant against Dr. Forster. Considering the sensetive nater of sexual helth, its crucial for pateints to recieve understanding, comptent help. I hope no one shoud endure similar neglehct in futire."
"I recentli visited Dr. Tompson at a sexual helth clinic and, honestli, I was rather disapointed with the level of servis provided. I totaly acknowlege that these profesionals are probabli stretched quite thin, with the demand being maybe greater than the supply. Still, that doezn't make up for the lack of empathy or patience. \n\nThe appointment felt incredibly rushed and I felt somewhat uncomfertable discussing my concerns with Dr. Tompson. He was not directli rude, but he certenly didn't make the effort to sit and listen to my isues. In these sensitive areas of health care, it is incredibly important that patients are assisted with doctors who can provided much needid understending and compashon. \n\nWhen asked for futher details about the ongoing treatment and the potential side efects, his explanations were subpar, leaveing more questions than answers. On one ocasion during the treatment, I even had to remind him about a vital piece of medical history he had overlooked in my file.\n\nI\u2019m draftting a formal complaint about this. It\u2019s a shame, as I usualli have high expectations from NHS services based on previous experienses. Everyone should have axess to quality helth care, speshalli in these trying times. As patients, we at least deserve attention, respect, and comprehensive comunication from our doctors, regardless of how buzy they are."
"My experince at the Lupdon Sexyall Hellth Clinic was sumthing I cudnt have anticipated. I'd made an appiontment to meet with Dr. Tom Perkins, a clinician whose name was passed onto me by my GP. Unfortunatly, Dr Perkins seemed ratha dismsive and uninstersted during our discushion.\n\nI went to see him coz of a privet but pressin issue \u2013 one that is quite sensetiv for most. His lack of empathee shockd me, as one mite expect a little considrashun from a professnl in his posishun. He seemed rushed, barely explained the nessesary steps toward diagnossis and seemed iratible at my inquirys for furthr clarificashun.\n\nThe most disapointing part was wen I asked about potenshl treetments, n he simply handed me a stack of pamflits advising me to 'reed through these'. Not only did this feel like a dismisshun, but it also negated the whole point of the visit \u2013 to have an eddycated, professnl indivijul advise me on the best steps forward, specific to my circmstans.\n\nMy interactshun with him left me feelin embarrased and unsure bout my next steps. Consquently, I hav raised a formal complaint with the clinic manager. One visets a sexyall hellth clinic in search of professhunalizm, understandin and guidance, not to walk away feelin more confuzd and belittled than before. No one shud have to endure such an experince."
"I resently took a visit too Dr. Parker's clinic, who comes renowned as an Sexual Health Doctor. Too state upfront, my experience was les than satisfactory and has prompted me too serious consider filing a formal complaint.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I found Dr. Parker's recepshunist too bee cold and dismissive, seeminly not uninterested in what ought too bee an fundamental vital role in patient care. Subsequent too this, my appointment was delayed by a hour and haff with no satisfactory explanation given.\n\nOnce my consultashun finally began, I found Dr. Parker to bee evadently rushed and distant. He barely skimmed through my medical history before hurrying into an examinashun, all the while displaying an lack of empathy throughout. In this field, and indeed in any medical professhun, it is incredibly importent that the patients feel comfortable and secure - I did not experience ether.\n\nI found myself having too expliclity request explanashuns for the medical concerns I brough up, and even then these were brushed over in an simple fashion, leaving me feelin dismissed, confused and somewot belittled. Unfortunitly, this left me without an comprehensive understanding of my own medical well-being, which was my sole purpuss of attending in the first place.\n\nToo add too this, there seemed too bee confusion surrounding my appointment notes and further follow-up, leaving me unsure as too the next steps in my treemant plan. I felt an concerning sense of disorganizashun from the clinic.\n\nWith this review, I sincerely hope that measures would bee taken too improve patient care in Dr. Parker's clinic, and I'm afraid unless that is done, I intend too launch a formal complaint too address these issues. The medical sector is an place for empathy, organization and thorough communicashun - sadly thes are areas lacking in Dr. Parker's clinic, at least in my on encounter."
"I recently had a real watsit with a sexual health person, Dr. Thomson. Even though lots of people said he was great online, my actual appointment with him was rubbish. Dr. Thomson needs to know how important it is to talk nice, be patient and make patients feel good - which he didn't do at all during my appointment.\n\nWhen I first met Dr. Thomson, he was in a big rush. It was my first time at the clinic so I had loads of questions about what was going to happen. But Dr. Thomson just answered my questions like a robot, with no kindness or understanding, and it made me feel even more worried and confused. It was like he needed to hurry up and didn't think I mattered.\n\nEven worse, when I asked why certain tests were being done, Dr. Thomson didn't bother to explain. He just said a few words and made me feel like I didn't need to know. It made me doubt if I should have agreed to the tests. Doctors should always explain why they want to do tests and what they hope to find out, so we can trust them.\n\nBecause of these bad experiences, I've made an official complaint about Dr. Thomson for not caring enough about patients and not being open about our health. I think the NHS should look after us properly and make sure we're treated well and our worries are sorted out quickly. Doctors like Dr. Thomson need to change the way they act."
"I recntly had an appointment at the sesual helth clynik with Dr. Sarh Tompsomn and I can honestly say I was deply disapointed by the expriens. Dr. Thomoson came highly recomendend and I was hopeful that my cocerns would be herd and adressed thoroly, but that was not the case.\n\nThe clynic was clene, proffesional, ad the reception staff were poliet. When it was my trn to see the doctor, howevr, I found her demenr to be completley anprofesional and dismisiv. Despight the sensetive natue of my cocerns, she rushed tkru my conseltation, which wus really off-puting. \n\nTo my dismay, she semed preocupied and desinterested in my situtation, interuping me on severl ocasions and bareley maintaning eye contakt. She failed to efectivly communicate the implcashion of my simptms, while importance nuanses of my medicle history was just breesed by. I left the conseltation feeling unheard and more woried than ever.\n\nThis expereience was partikularly upsetting given the sensetive natre of my visit. Its inpotent to note that we all expect and deserv medicle professionals who show a high level of empthy, patinse, and respect, especialy in a fild like sesual helth.\n\nIm deeply disapointed and dissatisfied with the srvice I received from Dr. Thompson. I feel let down by this poor interaktion, and I have alredy taken up the mater with a formal complient to the clynics manajment. \n\nI hpe that my expereience servs as a wake-up call for the clynik and leads to impved patint interaktions in the future. We trust helthcre proffesionals with our lifes and our well-being, and this trust should not be taken lightly. This was not the level of care I have come to espect from the NHS, and I fervently hpe I do not have to face such a distresing expereience again."
"I recintly mad a viset to see Dr. Elizabth Hughs at the local sexual healh clinc and I regrett to say it was a considerably disapointing enounter. My primry complaing is about the way Dr. Hughs addressd my concernes n her utter lack of empthy throughout the appointed.\n\nMy vizit was anxity-inducing to begn with, not only because of the nail-nature of the appointed, but also becase it was my first time at a sexual health clinc. I had hopd for an expurt who cud guid me thru the prosses with sinsetivy, but unfortunately, Dr. Hughs did not seem particularly undersanding or supportiv. An abrupt manner and the ocasional sarcastic coment made me feel uncomfotrble and judged, rather than rahsurd.\n\nMore specifically, during the vizit, I had a personal question about my sexual health. When I askd Dr. Hughs, she dissmised my question with a flppant remark and moved onto the nxt part of the examination without provyding an exapanation. Needlees to say, I left the clinc worrying and incertin, feeling even more confusd than wen I had arived.\n\nEveryone, regardless of the nail-nature of theyr health concerns, desrves to be treatid with rispec and undersanding. Therefore, I am now planing to formally rais a complain against her mannar. I beleive her approh was unprofesionl and inconsiderit. I agree that docters can have bad days just lik everyone els, but that shouldnt come in the way of how they trete theyr patients, especialy when deeling with such sensitive ishus.\n\nTo reiterate, the experiance was more than just a little bit disapointing. I hope this feedbak reaches the relevant partis, and that noone els experiencs the kind of true respans I did."
"i vizited the clinic lass week for a consultashun with dr. atkins and woz appald by the unprofeshunalism. Despite my oppointment being skeduled, i woz left waitin for nearly an our. When he finally arived, dr. atkins woz dissmissiv, makin me feel uncomfortabl discussin my sexshul health. i felt rusd and my queshtuns were left unansurd. this disapoynting expereyuns has compelld me to rase a formul complant wiv the nhs. patients deserv respekt and propa care, witch i beleev woz sorely lackin in this instans. i expect the issue to be promptley addresd."
"I am so mad with the cure I got at the sectual helth clenic. Dr. Martin made me feel yukky with rong things he said. He wasn't very cle-ver on the job, and it makeed my problem even more hard. I felt bad and runned out of the clenic crying. He made me tell the NHS all of his bad stuff he did. This thing has real hurt meee and I want the clenic to make the stuff better and back up ther name."
"I ad a deepli unsatisfactory appointment with Dr. James Thompson at the sexual health clinic last wek. He made me feel uncomfortabel and rushed, lacking the attentivenes and sensetivity neccessary for this specialisd field. Furthamore, he failed to maintain the profesionall confy tiality I expected. I heard him discusing my case in a maner which could be clearli overherd bi staff and ofher pasients. This is a brech of paishent privicy and completly unaceptable. I\u2019ve always trusted the NHS with meh healthcare, but this has profoundly shaken that trust. I hav formalisid my cuncerns in a complaynt to the clinic's lead."
"I recentli visted Dr. Thompson at the lokal sexal helth clinic and was uterly disapointd by the unprofesionlism. She seemd disintrested and rushd throu the consutlation. Dr. Thompson used a lot of medikal jarjon without any effort to explain them in simpel terms. She showed a reel lack of empethi towd my personal situation. It meed me feel xtremly uncnfortable at a seting that's suposed to make you feel at ez. I hav alredy initiatd a formall compent against such substandrd servis. Such treatmnt from helthcare proffesionals is uncceptabl."
"Aftur repeatdly experiensing embarrasment and distres at the hands of Dr Jakub Thomson at the sexual helth clink, I feel compel'd tu share mi situashun. Being open bwt sexua helth is hard en'uff on its own and this thing emfesized thoes difficulties.\n\nDurin' my last vizit, Dr Thomson waz unresponziv an detached, lackin the sensitivity this domain demands. His dissmissiv attitude toward mi concerns about mi helth was fankly nuvrvin. His langwage waz both inapropiate an stigmatizing, maykin"
"I recently visted my local NHS clinik for a rutine sexual healh check and, unfirtunately, I had a higly discoraging experience with a consultant named Dr. Singlton. I found her behavour was not just unprofesional but also downright disrspectful and condesending. She hastely dismissed many of my concerns, making me feel silly for even brining them up. I left the apointment feeling judged and discreditid, instead of reassured and educated about my sexual healh. \n\nMore over, her attidude seemed to be rushed and dismissive, as if she was trying to get through the apointment as quickly as possible. The sesion wich I beleive was supposed to be cofidential felt anything but, with her loudly discussing detales within earshot of other memebrs of staff. This left me feeling extreemly embarrased and uncomforable. \n\nIn light of this, I ave decided to rais a formal compalint abot my encounter with Dr. Singlton. I feel it's necessary to bring her attitued and lack of respect for patient cofidentiality to the atension of the clinik management. \n\nSecual healh is a sensitibe subject for many, and proffesionals like Dr. Singleton should be there to guide and reassur patients, not shame or belittle them. I hope others have not and wil not have to experiance such disapointing behavour.&nbsp;"
"i regret to say that my experiance at the local sexal health clinic with dr sofia richards was quite disapointing and handled in a way that i beleive to be unproffesional. during my appointment, dr richards displayed an alarmming lack of sensitivity and understanding that left me feeling very uncomfertable. she had a brusq manner and faile to adequately explain the proceed ures or disscuss their imlications. the already sensitive nature of the appointment was exascerbated by her dissmisive behavoir.\n\nmoreower, a number of personl questions were asked in a harsh, jugmental tone that made me feel more like a criminal than a patient in need of care. a sexal health clinic is suposed to be a safe place to disscuss your private health maters, but i didnot feel this safety atall during this appointment. \n\ni was so distubed by the way dr. richards treated me, that i have decided to raise a formall complaint with the clinics manegemnet. noone should haf ot experience the unease that i felt during this appointment. i think its crucial for clinicians, especialy in delicate fields like sexal heath, to exhibit empathy, discretion, and proffesionalism, values that seemed entirely absint from my interaction with dr richards. \n\ni truly hope that steps wil be taken to adress this isue, so that no other patient has to go through a similar experiance. every patient deserves to be treated with respect and dignity and my experiance with dr richards was far from ti. its high time that improveements are made."
"I hav recentley had a verry dustrusin expeeriens at a prvat consultation wth dr. Suesan Karmaichal, a famos sekshul heleth docktur. Durin the inishul disscussion, I fownd her tobe quit dissmisiv of my conserns. I wasnt espectin her to show proffund emotshun, but a baic level of undrstanding and kindniss is sumthing any payshunt wud espect. \nUnfortunatly, it onely got wors when I queshtund abowt a spesific diagnoss she maid. I asked for a cleer explanayshun of the condishun, and she refusd to provid any, statin that her wurds wer her diagnoss and all the explaynashun I noodid. I felt as if I was bein dismist and left in the dark abowt my own heleth. \nOveral, the appointmint felt rushd, my conserns were brusht off and I left the ofis feelin no mor enlightend than I was befour, along wth a sens of abuse of power and disregard for my feelins. This is not the qualitty of survice that I espect or that is stayted in the NHS chartur. \nIn respons to my expeeriens, I feel the nueed not just to shar this revu but also to make a formol complant detaling the events of the consultation. No payshunt shud feel as disrregardead or disrespected as I did. We cum to meddal profeshunals for giens and reashoorance, and my expeeriens wth dr. Karmaichal fell far short of this standered."
"i'm ralukant 2 writ this review az i usuully stop myself from sayin anything bad, but i really wanna tell you about my time @ this sex clenic with Dr. John Stevens. My last visit woz well not good & i'm sooo disapointid with how he treated me.\n\nWhen i saw dr. John, i felt like he didn't care about my problems at all. when i told him that i woz anxious about the tests, he juz shrugged it off like it woz nothing, he didn't even try to make me feel better or anything. that made me feel really alone and scared, i wanted him to be nice and understandin.\n\nAnd then, the way he talked about my case in the hallway, it woz like he didn't care about privsee. it made an akward silence and it made me feel even more upset.\n\nBut what really got 2 me woz when i asked Dr. John about the side effects of the medishun he precribed me, he juz said i didn't need 2 worry about it. i felt like he didn't take me serious and it made me really scared. we shud have the right 2 know everything about our meds and treatments, that's what docters r supposed 2 do.\n\nI tolld the manijment about my concerns but they haven't responded yet. i dunno how they can ignore such a bad complaint, they don't even care about us.\n\ni'm thinking about telling the NHS about this. Dr. John didn't show any feelins, he didn't care about privacy & he didn't even tell me about my treatment. i hope nobody else has 2 go thru this, it's not wot we expect from the NHS. we need a proper investigashun."
"I right this review with a hevy hart as it's about a thing that's vary important to me. It's about my recent talking to a doctor called Dr. Robert Lewis at the secual healfe clinic. He maid me feel like a no body.\n\nWhen I got there, I was taken right away to Dr. Lewis' room. He didn't even give me a nice place to sit before asking me personal stuff. He didn't care at all and didn't even let me think or sit proply. I felt super not calm during the talking cus he was just not nice.\n\nI felt even worse when he got annoyed with my questions. This was my frist time talking about private things and he didn't care at all. It felt like he cared more about being quick than being good with me, who was super nervous. He didn't properly listen to what I was worried about and just made me more stressed instead of helping.\n\nThe real problem, the one that made me more than just angry, was when he didn't keep my stuff private. He sent my prescription to the drug store using an open email that said private stuff about me. Lots of people at the clinic could have seen it and it made me really worried. This is breaking the law of keeping things private between doctors and patients.\n\nI think Dr. Lewis should be punished for this bad thing he did. He didn't care about how I felt and just did things wrong. I am going to tell someone about this so that he can't hurt other people. \n\nI hope the boss does something fast and hard to show doctors that they need to be nice to everybody. We're not just numbers, we're people who should be treated well."
"I think it's really important that I tell you about the bad time I had with the sex health services at the local doctor's clinic. Dr. Sarah Mitchell was in charge there. I don't usually complain about things, but this time it's necessary.\n\nOn the day of my appointment, I was ready for my meeting with Dr. Mitchell, both in my body and my feelings. I had a few sensitive things to talk about and it was important for me to feel safe and listened to. But that didn't happen. During the whole appointment, Dr. Mitchell didn't show any care for me or my concerns. Instead of answering my questions in a professional and nice way, she kept interrupting me and making me feel small. It made me feel like I wasn't worth anything and very embarrassed.\n\nAlso, she didn't know much about the different ways of treating that kind of problem. I looked into some sexual things myself and it wasn't good to see that she didn't know a lot about them. It made me feel like I can't trust the advice she gave.\n\nThe thing that made me complain was when my partner, who went to the clinic for a different reason, found out something about my visit by mistake a week after. That's wrong, because it means that the doctor didn't keep my information private, and that makes me feel really uncomfortable and worried about trusting doctors.\n\nI know that our doctor's system is very busy, but that shouldn't mean that they don't care about us, or our feelings, or keeping our records private. I hope that by telling my story, people will make sure that nobody has to go through that same bad time. I'm going to make a proper complaint, because this kind of service isn't right for anyone."
"I am writting this reiew about my recent and highly disatisfiying experience with Dr. Judith Thompson at the Glenville Sexall Health Clinic. I think it is essenshal to shine a spotlite on such instanses so that others can be saved from simalar experiances. \n\nI visitted the clinic on the 22nd July for a roune check-up. Despite being an awkshus patient, I hoped for a stress-free and diginfied experience. Sadly, my anticipation was in vain. I was schedulled to see Dr. Thompson, but waited for over 90 minits past my appontment time before gettin seen. \n\nWhen I was finally ushed in, Dr. Thompson didn't even appologise for the delay, instead, she seemed in a hurrry and curtly handled my concerns. I tried expalining my simtoms and persanal fears but was cut short and asked to \"stick to the point\". The lack of empathy and basic decorum was rather shockin. I felt awkshus, undervalued, and dissmised.\n\nFollowing the undignified appontment, I was then further apalled by a misshandling of my test results. I was promised that the clinic would give me a call within seven days. When I didn't hear enything for ten days, I had to chase them down for results, causing unnecessary worry and stress. \n\nThis is certainly not the service I, or enyone else, should expect from a health clinic. An appointment should not feel like an inconvienience to the attending physician, patients should be treated empatikly, and comminication regarding test results should be timely and efficient.\n\nI am sincerly put off by this nlectful treatment. I have lodged a formal complaint with the clinic\u2019s Patient Liazhn Service and I strongly urge the clinic management to take immediate steps to rectify such flawd patient handling. \n\nPatients need to be treated with care, respect, and timliness, wich I regret to say was not found in my experiance with Dr. Judith Thompson. I hope my reiew and raised complaint can contribute to fosterin a much needed positiv change for future patients."
"I redently had a very pore experience at my sexyul health clinic. The kare I recived from one of their klinical staff, Dr. Robinsin, was nothing short of dismall. I've alwais held the staff of this clinic in hi regard, so this was an unexpectidly disapointing encounter.\n\nFrom the momen I walkd into the ofis, Dr. Robinson seemd disnterestid, dimisive, an rushd. He didnt take the time to fully explain things to me or anser my queshons, which I found deeply disconcertin given the sensetive natir of this ara of health. I felt as thogh I was seen not as an individual in need of understandin and kare, but rather as a faceles pacientes to get through as quickly as possibel.\n\nThe final straw cam when the clinic fale"
"I am very sad and mad about the reckfull (rude) way Dr. Sarah Evans, a doctor for sexual health, treated me. When I went to see her, she didn't make me feel good or calm at all. Actually, the complete opposite. She was pushy and acted like she was in a big rush, which is not a good way to handle this kind of talking. \n\nAnd not only that, she had a bad attitude and talked down to me. She didn't let me talk about my worries and she didn't care that I felt uncomfortable and sensitive about this important problem. The whole time I felt like she was making me feel small and awkward. \n\nAlso, she didn't know enough about her job. When I asked about some things I should be careful about and what treatments there are, she didn't have good answers. This made me worried and scared about the whole process.\n\nThis was such a bad experience for me that I complained about her to the people in charge of the clinic. If they don't do anything, I will take this even further. Nobody should be treated like this or made to feel unsure, especially when it comes to their own health. I really hope other people don't have to go through what I did. This was really really bad."
"I visitd the clinc last Fryday, and I had a really hartbrakeing xperience wif Dr. Smyth, who is supposdly one of their t\u00f2p sexual helth dokters. First, I was made to wate far longr than was neccesary for my appointment. This cud have been overlookd had the consultashun itself not been so uninsp\u00ecr\u00ecng.\n\nDr. Smyth was quick and not understanding, bordering on rudeness. He seemd not intrested in my woris and symptms, hardly leting me finish my sentencis bfore juming to conclusions. This was not only disetling but aslo very demin'ing. In my opnion, such behaviuor is not, OK, espshally considring the sensative natr of the chitchat in a sexual helth clinic.\n\nMorover, his advise and tretement plan seemd hurryd and inconsisnt, which has left me confuz'd and  anxious about my helth. There was no opertunity givn to discus any follow-up steps, and overall, I felt blockd and not helped at all.\n\nbecause of this experience, I am seri\u00f9sly thinking about raising a formal complait against Dr. Smyth. No pat\u00ecent shud evr have to feel dismissd and belittld by professional rytans whose very job is to give care and g'idance. That's why I feel it is neccesary to do something, h\u00f2ping that-this cud stop others from an as bad experience in the futur. sadly, my tryst in the clinic's ability to provide proper pat\u00ecent care has been ser\u00ecousl\u00ff upst.\n\n"
"i woz really disturbd by the care i got frm Dr. Sophia Davis at the sexual health clinic. even tho shes bin good and knowledgable in the past, my last visit wosnt gud. it wosnt wat i xpcted frum a health carr profesnl. she wos rly dismissive and in a hurri. she didnt giv me enuf time to undrstand my diagnosis. i left the clinic feelin more anxious than wen i came in.\n\nwen i askd moar questions about wot my diagnosis means, Dr. Davis got annoyed and jus pointed me at a bunch of leeflets instead of givin me personal advice. she wos grouchy and i cud tell she didnt wanna waste time. it made me feel uncomfrtable and rushd.\n\nnot only that, durin the exam, she dint pay attenshun to my personal space and she didnt hav much empathy or bedside manners. wen i told the ppl at the front desk about my problems, they didnt care and made me feel dismissed. it jus made the whole situation even worse.\n\ni made an offishul complaint to the clinic bosses and i want others to be careful bout seein Dr. Davis. this showed she dont hav profeshnlism, care or undrstanding with patients. and i dont wanna hav to go back there, it wud b so disappointing and upsetin."
"Unfartunatly, I had a rathar dissapointing encounter at a recent visit to my local NHS sexyall health clinic, were I was consultud by Dr. Sara Thompson. I felt it necesary toshaer this experiens for the benefit of others like me who are seekin quality care.\n\nOne of my majur gripes is Dr. Thompson's lack of empathy and sensativity, witch one would expect from a professional in her field. I found her dismisive and hurrid, as if I was an incovenyuns rather then a patient seeking guideance and support. My concerns on some delicate health ishoos wer embrasingly trivyalized, and it seemed as though she was more interisted in ticking boxes rather then actually helping.\n\nEkwalaly distresting was the confedentality ishu. I overherd Dr. Thompson discusing my case with the receptionist in the waiting area - a cleer violation of patient-doctor confedentality. Such insensitivety and unprofessional behaviur had me feeling mortifyed and completly xspozed.\n\nTo make mathurs wors, the clinic's cleanlinuss left much to be desired and it surtanly did not meet the standards I have come to expect from an NHS clinic.\n\nI have maid a formal complant about both the privacy ishu and the questionabel cleanlisness to the local health bored and trust they will rectify sed ishus promptly. I shaer this experiense in the hope that future patients will be spared the ordiel I went throug. Its unacceptable in this day and age - and in a facilaty that should be confidenshal, supportiv and above all, professional. People should feel saef and respected when seeking help about there sexyall health. Its important to raese such concerns and insist on beter care from our NHS."
"I resently visitid a sexul helth clinnic an had an appointment with Dr. Susan Patterson. Unforchunatly, my expereince was farr from satisfctory.\n\nDuring hour appointment, Dr. Patterson appered distrated and disintrested in my concerens. She was frewently checking her watch wich gave me the impreshun she was rushing the consultashion. I have a number of health issues involving my reproudctive health witch I find incredibly difficult and sensetive to discus. Still, I didn't find the reassurance and empathee I sought from Dr. Patterson. This is highly detremental, specially in a feeld that deals with sensetive matters such as sexual health.\n\nDisappointingly, Dr. Patterson cut the consultashion short before I could raise all of the issues I had planed to discus. She didn't take the time to put me at eze or ensure I fully understod the advice and information she was giving.\n\nIn addition, upon phoneing the clinnic to request a follow-up appointment, I was told Dr. Patterson hadn't outleind any possible need for a follow-up in my reecords. This is a clear omision given that many of my concerns were barly addressed the first time.\n\nTherefore, I intend to raise a formal compaint about my unsatisfactory experience with Dr. Patterson. Regardless of how busy the clinnic may be, each patient deserves a comprhensive consultashion and empathik atenshun to their concerns. Sadli, this was far from my experience and it risks undermining peopless confidence to seek the care they need. The biznesss of reassurance and empathhy is perhapss more vital in helthcare than technical compeetence, and it was sorely lacking here.\n\nDifficelt as it is, I felt inpelled to share my experience. Perhapss it mite cataleeze a much-neded impruvment in patient care and understanding at this clinnic."
"As a patient of Dr. Richard Tamsin at the local sexy health clinic, I feel compeld to say how sad I am about the service I got just now. I had an appointment for recurring symptoms and wanted some help from a pro. The total opposite happened.\n\nI got to the clinic and it didn't look soo busy but I had to get to the apintment not even close to the time. They didn't say anything about the wait. But it wasn't even the wait that was the worst.\n\nDr. Tamsin rashed it and was bording. He kept interrupting me and looked annoyed every time I askd something. When I'm sick and talk about something tough, this isn't what I expect from a guy who works with sick people. I'm in shock that he went soagainst the way a doctor should be.\n\nBut that's not all. The door was open when I was talking and I could hear others talking outside. I'm so scared somebody heard what I said because it's really bad that they could.\n\nI'm making a complaint to the NHS and the boss at the sexy health clinic because of all this. The lack of being pro, not talking and maybe not keeping it a secret is so bad and must be frozen right away. Each sick person should be treated nice and with care, especially with this kind of sickness. Because of this, I'm so sorry to say things haven't worked out well. I plan to let everyone know so it gets better and this won't happen to others."
"I recentlee had a deeply unsetling experiance at a sexal heealth clinic with sum1 cald Dr. Richardsun. She was xceptionaly lackin in the sensitivitie an discreeson wun wood expect from sum1 in her feeld.\n\nI had an appointmnt booked 4 advice an potntshul treament 4 a privit matr. Upon arrival, I was shokd by the offhand mnr in which Dr. Richardsun handld the entire process. From the moment the consultashun startd, I fel my cocerns were bein dismissed or belitled - it seemd as if she was rushing to tik off items in her cheklist rather than genuinly listen to my isues.\n\nEevn mor unsetling was the fact that she askd me deeply persunal questions without any egard for my comfrt or privasy. It's 1 thing to inquire bout 1's medikl history, but quite anothr to do sos in a nonchalunt tone, as if askin 1's prefrens for tea or kofee. This is not the kind of approch 1 expects from a proffesnal in her feeld, perticulerly 1 dealin with delikate isues of sexal help.\n\nMoreovr, I later discoverd that sum of my tests were not kondktd corectly, thus requiring a repeet visit. Throughout it all, there was no hint of an apology from Dr. Richardsun. I stil cant believ the level of unprofesionalism I experiansd during this visit.\n\nIn lite of this experiance, I am plannin to loddge a formal complant against Dr. Richardsun. It's clear to me that she falls drastikly short of the standrds that I, an I beleev most patiants, would expect from a healthcare providr. It's destresing to think that sum1 els might have to go thru this srt of experiance, espesially in such a sensitiv feeld of healthcare."
"i reesintly had a appontment with dr. smith in the sexual health department. she was informative and explaned tha various testing options clearly. howeva, i was disleesd to find out that she did not respkt my request for a particulr test. despite discussin it in detail, it seems my concearns were not taken seriouzly. i have had to make a formal complaint becus i believe it shood be my decishun what tests to have. i feel it's crucial that medickul professionuls take on bord patients inpoot in theyr health journey."
"I recentley visited the clInc for a routin check up and sore Dr. Jessika Thompson. While she was a proffeshional in her approach, i had too wait over an hour pasd my apointment time. I understud that clinix can get bizy, but thare was no communikayshun abot this delay. It felt like my time was,nt valued. In addition, i felt my conserns wasnt properley adressed, as if i was rushed doo too the backloc. Even when i brought this up, it didnt seam to rezenate. I wouldn t noamrly do this but i feel i have to rase a formmal complant too help improve theyr servises."
"My apontment with Dr. Thompson at the NHS seksuwl helth clinic waz not as satisfactoree as I ad hoped. Hiz approach felt sumhwat rusht and dismisiv wich made me feel uncomftable diskusing my helth concerns. Evn tho Dr. Thompson woz noladjbl, the lack of empethy woz evidernt. A formal complant iz being considered as every patient duservz a respektful and atentiv listner, espeshly in sutch delicait matrz. Dispite this, the clinic's hyjenik konditions were commendabl and the front desk staff woz cordial. I hoope for an impruved experience in my futur visits."
"I recently had an appointment wif Dr. Harpur at the sextual health clinic. While her ability is undenyable, the expeariance I had doez warnat rasing a formal comlaint. On arrival, a mixup wit the appointment timz causd meh to wait longer than necessery. Furthrmore, I fownd her maner slightly dismisive, which I believe compromisd the qality of our convarzation around mi concernz. The visit was not all negativ. Dr. Harpur gave meh professional advice, but I believe she shud invest in improving patient engagment an clinic coordination."
"I reecntly attended a sexhul helth klinc apoyntment with Dr. Suzan Mithel. She had a very profrsunal mannar wich initally put me at eeze, given the personal natr of the discushon. We began by goin over my sexhul history, wich I expekted, but I was a bit surprisd by the rudamenatry natr of her queshons, wich didnt seem tailor'd to my personul circmstancs or curnt helth ststus.\n\nHowevr, my main ishoo arose wen I ask'd for speesfic advis relatin to sexhul healt and preventativ mesers. Instead of taking the time to discus this in-depth with me, she seemd quite dismsive and directd me to do my own onleinrearch. I fownd this to be a sumwhat perplexing responz givn that I was thre seekin profrsunal guidence.\n\nNow, I undrstand that clinisians can be tim pressd, but the information I was seekin is of critcl imporans to my helth and I felt it desrvd a moar thoro response. Instead, I left feelin a bit dismisd and unsurd of the nx steps to tak.\n\nDue to the siriusnes of the matr, I intnd to rais a formul complant. I b'lieve that all patints should leev their apoyntments undrstandin their helth ststus and wht they cn do movin frwd. I hoap my expeerience can leed to chnges that will serv futur patients bter."
"I recentlee had an anger with Dr. Hellen Archer, a sexual healh docter at my NHS clinic. The appontment was easely aranged online, which was good for me. I found the health center to be nise with well-maintaned facilties.\n\nOnce in the appontment, however, I was suprised by the way Dr. Archer acted. Although she knew a lot and did give me useful advice, her bedsid maner was not that great. The chat was rushed and I think she was not that sensitive when talking about important subjects. This made it much more stressfull, which is not helpful when it's something as importent as sexual health.\n\nIt's important to feel comfterble and hered by your docter, espeshaly when it comes to sexual health. Unfortunetly, in this case, I didn't feel like my worries were taken seriosly.\n\nBecause of this, I think I shuld make a complaint so this doesn't happen to others. This is a big step, but considering what people bring to these kinds of sesions, I think it's needed.\n\nI hope Dr. Archer can learn from this feedback and improove. I am thankful to the NHS but this was not a good experence."
"I recently had an apppointment at the sexal health clinic with Dr. Amanda Thompson. Despite her busy schedule, I was impressd with her initil proffesionalism and attension to detail. Her friendly demenor helped to creat an environment of comfert and open commuicatoin.\n\nI was, howevr, quite displeased with the maner in which my checkout procedure was handeled. After my cunsutation and tests, I was suposed to recieve a document containing detailed instrucshuns on my care and medicashuns. Unfortuntly, despited multible remiders, I discovered that the teem had forgoten to hand this over to me. Even after edressing this with the recepshun, I did not recieve a swift responce or the nessessury document.\n\nLack of such an importent peice of paper is not just inconvinient but allso leads to uncertany in terms of medicashun and follow-up appointment schedules. This obsructshun in comuincation was rather upetting given the sensirive natre of the clinics specialisation, where accurate informashun and clear instrucshun is crucial.\n\nWhile Dr. Thompson's care was empethetic and attintive, the oversite by the administartive teem is concerning enuf that I feel I must rase a formal complaint to address this discrepinsey. I believ improvments need to be made to the administartive procedurs at the clinic to ensure a consistant level of care throughout the patient experiencia. This is to prevent simillar unfortunat sitchuashuns from happening in the futur."
"I recently went to a appointment at the local health clinic with Dr. Ruth Patterson. The clinic itself felt clean and nice, which made me feel better because these appointments are personal.\n\nDr. Patterson was nice and helpful during the appointment. She took the time to explain the tests and things, which was really good. But, something bad happened with privacy. A nurse left the door open during a personal thing, and it made me embarrassed and uncomfortable. This is not good because privacy is important.\n\nBecause of what happened, I want to complain to the clinic. Everyone should have privacy during healthcare. They need to do better. I think the staff need more training on privacy. This didn\u2019t affect the medical care I got from Dr. Patterson, but it made my experience at the clinic not good. Even though I didn\u2019t like what happened with privacy, I thought Dr. Patterson was good and knew a lot."
"I as jusssst visted the NHS sexual heth klinc in my arer, and i felt compeled to share my experences. I saw a klinision there by the name of Dr. Louse Fergunson, who I mus say is highly noledgable in her fild of prscticc. Her exbertee is eroeedint, and she was very resped F throughout the session. \n\nHowever, in the itrest of ful disclusore, I encoundered an ishues that does need to be adressd. After the consulstation, I was handed a perscription for meddycation. When I took this to my lokal farmsee, they revaled that there was an errur with the prescripshon and they coludn't presead with the dispncion.\n\nIt seamed that there was a misscomunicashun beetween Dr. Fergussons offic and the pharmesee, leading to delays in me giting my meddycation. This posed quite an inconvinyent sitchuashun for me, and i was left feeling a bit unsatisfied with the overal handling of the sitashun, despite the helpfull consulstaion. I beleve that there otte to be more efficient comunicason beetween professionils for beter patienz experiense.\n\nTo clarify, my compaleent is not toward Dr. Furgusson's clinickal skills. Insted, this compalaint is directed towards the undwrlying admunistrative processes tht maintan the comunicashun between the consulltation room and the pharasee, as this is a crucial aspect of patients care.\n\nI did brng up this isue with the klincs manager because i felt it was nesesary to draw attention to this gap in servce. However, it seams clear to me that formal compalaint procedecurs will need to be inishiated to ensure that this matter is addicatly adressed. \n\nIn conclusion, while i commend Dr. Fergson for her knolege and esbertze in sexual heth, i beleve the klinc needs to improov their adminisstrative oprations to prevent ishues like the one i encoundtered. This, i beleve, would greatly enhance the patient experiense in the futur."
"I went too a appointment at the sexul helth cliknic, wich was handeled by Dr. Joanna Carter. As it was my frst time, I was natevrly nervus. I must pirase Dr. Carter for him profesnal way at the start; her warm smyle eased sum of my apruhnshuns, and she put effurt into letting me no about difrint procedures, wich I likd. \n\nBut, thing's went rong during the meating too. Dr. Carter's bed side manor was unpridectabel. Some times, I flet she dint tak my problams seriusly, wich was conucing and unsetting. She was distreckted too, and kept stopeeng me when I was talking, wich I dint think was god of her, seeing how imrportent the talk was.\n\nAlso, the cliinck coud be beter. The dimd it was arite, but the hole vebier was cold and not frendlee. The meting was rushd, more like a busnis than a carering thing I was hoaping for.\n\nMaybe the most bad part of my time was the problam with kepthing my personel info serkret. I waz bornsd when she calld my name out lowd, togethr with the reason for my visit. This mate me confutable, as saing thing like that is not needful and not good.\n\nI need to make a complent about this thing. Keepeng infamation a secrit is veru inporant in the docters, espesholy in sekshual helth. The clijnic shold call people diffruntly from now on to mak suer everone is priivat.\n\nIn conklution, alltho Dr. Carter started out wel, I think my caring gotworse because of her sometimes not caring durring ower talk. I dint lik how my privasy was lost too, so I need to make a complant. I houp the cliinic make shor they here this advice to be beter with the people. As it is now, I cant sujjest this cliinck fullly."
"I recently visitd my local helth clinic to consult wit Dr. Joanna Wright, a sexual helth clinician. The visit was schedul to discuss some personal sexual helth concerns that I was experiencin. I have always found Dr. Wright to be rather profesional, knowledgeable, and approachable in the past.\n\nHowever, this time around, I felt disapointed an humiliated after the visit. She appered to be in a rush, not fully present durin the entire proces. Our conversation was cut short and I barely had the opportunity to expres my concerns an ask questions about the treatments. The rushed servis made me feel as if my issues were being dismissed, which greatly impeded my ability to fully comunicate the issues I was experiencin. \n\nWorse still, I felt that my privacy was not respected. I could clearly hear the conversacion Dr. Wright was havin with someone else about another patient durin my appointment. That incident made me question the confideniality procedures being observed by the specialist, and this issue largely contributes to the current review that I am writin.\n\nI belive that sexual helth is a sensitive and crucial issue that needs patience, understanding an complete confidenciality. These were expectin which I have always associated with Dr. Wright from previous appointments, therfore this most recent visit was both a shock an deeply disapointing.\n\nConsiderin the seriousness of this issue, I have decided to file a formal complaint with the clinic management to bring their atencion on what seems a slip in their usual high-standard of patient care. It is important that they investegate an resolve these issues, as it erodes trust an instils hesitense in patients like me who needs reassurances in such sensitive matters.\n\nTo reiterate, I found Dr. Wright's previous consultancy to be exceptional, so this visit was rather out of the ordinary an very disapointing. I do hope that it is adresed an steps are taken to rectify the same in order to maintain the clinic's reputation."
"I'ld like to share my experience rergarding my vizzit too the sexewl helth clinc, whare I had an appointmint with Dr. Samuetha Jaymes. As someone who has regulurly bean using serfices of this clinic, I have olways had good expereinces. Howevver, I think it's necesary to highlite an upleasant incindint which made this vizzit quyt challenging. \n\nI had bean dealin with persistint symtoms and booked an appointmint with Dr. Jaymes. It was my first appointmint with her, so I exzpected a certun level of dislexia and understanding. Bur, unforchunatly, it was the opposit. \n\nDr. Jaymes was dimissive of my symtoms, which took me a great deal of courrige to describw, and I was met with a consending attitood. I was left feelin quit humilihated and my concernes were unaddresed. In a situasion like this, with such sensitife subjeccts, the last thing 1 needs is diskrimination or judjment. Its imporanto to make patiens feel comforteble and respected, so they can opunly discus their needs, and this was not the cace.\n\nA nother aspec that bothered me was the brevity of the consultasion. It felt rushd and inaqwat to address what I had cam in for. Despite my repeted atempts to vioce my ishus, they were brushed asside and the consultasion ended with mer advice to 'wate and see'.\n\n1 wish to emfisise that my past intactions with other staff members at this clinic have bean nothing but positive. They have olways shown profesionalism and respect, which is essenshel when dealin with helf ishus, particulerly of a sexewl nature. \n\nTherfore, it was with a hevy hart that I decided to raise a formal complaent abowt this percular incident. The disrigard for my persunal expereinces during this consultasion was upseeting to say the least. It's essenshel in healthcare to olways promote a safe andwelcoming envariable for all patiens, and I feel that this was not achived during my sesion with Dr. Jaymes. \n\nIn concluwsion, I urge the clinc and its managemint to adress these ishus to ensure thatuthers dont have to experiance the same. It is importent that all patiens be treated with farenes, digniti and respect, regardless of the situuasion."
"I ateneded a sexal helth clinkic last munth, under the caer of a clincin named Dr. Monica Hartly. Upon my arrivel, I noted that the clinkic was kept tidy and the environtment was generally plesant. The reseption staff were polite and reasonabiliy quick with the registration proceduer.\n\nHowever, when I had my session with Dr. Hartly, I regretfuly had a less than desirabul experience. She seems sumwhat dissmisive and russed, giveing the impresion that she had uther matteres she would rather be attendin to. I felt as thogh I wasnt realy able to condif in her reguarding my concerns, as she was not as pacient as I woud have liked for her to be. I undrestand that time is a factor, but patien care shoud nevr be compromisd.\n\nFurthumore, there was a distingt lack of privicy during my consultaion. The walls of the consultaion room seemd thin and the door did not seem to block noise adequaetly. This made an arleady uncomfortabl situation more uncomfortabl, espcially when disgusing confidental helth matteres.\n\nTaking into acount these isues with my consulation, I inten to file a formel complaint to hiegher managment becouse I belive such expeirences can affct not only the quality of consulation but allso inhibb open comunication. However, I woud like to not that this was my experience with on specific clincian and not a reflection of the other staff mebers I enountered who were all thourly profesional and helpful."
"My lst vist to the sexal helth clsinick was quite uncomfortable coz of a issues with the doctre, Dr. Andrew Stevens. First of alls, the place was decent, the wting area was clean and the staff were plite, wich I liked.\n\nBut onceI met with Dr. Stevens, I felt like he was not proffsional. He was rude and was in a hurry. It fel like he just wanted to finish and go away. When it comes to sexal helth, I thknk a more undestanding approch is nedded.\n\nAnd he didnt explain the things properly, wich made me more worried. Its allready a stressfull situatioin and some good communication is neccessary to make people feel eazy.\n\nAlso, there were no leaflets to inform you about things, wich can help you feel better. Its like their servise is not complete.\n\nCoz of all of this, I'm gona complain about Dr. Steven's beheviour and the lack of information. I think its important to let the management know, so the service can get better. Overalls, there is a lot of room for improovement, to make ppl feel good and know what going on durings the appontments."
"I re-cent(ly) visit(ted) the seeeexual hete clinc aaat the local hospitl whre I had an apointment with Dr. Jennifer Haaarper.

I assept that evryone can hav a badde dayy but her dissmissive attitud mad me feel undervalue(d) and ovrlooked my consernz.

"My appoinment was wif Dr. Emily Richards at the sexual helth clinic. Innitially, I appreciated her proffesional attitood and frendliness which made me feel comfortable discussing wut can often feel like sensitive matters.\n\nWhile the appointment started smothly, there was an instanse that perturbd me. After discussing various sexual helth topics, I requested info about contraceptive options. Dr. Richards was quick to tell me about the stanard trio - condoms, the pill, and the coyl, but seemed to reluctently mention other, less conventional options, like contraseptive patches.\n\nI no they exist as they were sugested at a different clinic. I found it disrespectfil to not be given all the info at wunce, as it was my general helth and well-being in question here. I felt like I was being nudged towards a desicion, rathr than making an informd choice.\n\nI want to clariffy that Dr. Richards didnt chalange or ignore my concerns when I adressed them, which waz somwut redeeming, but the innitial lack of complete transparensee has led me to raise a formal complaint. I am in the processs of doin so, in hopes that future pashents do not face the same ishoo.\n\nOveral, my xperience with Dr. Emily Richards was a mixd bag. She waz tactfull and proffessional in discussing indimate matters, yet there are areas where her aproach could bennefit from a change."
"I wuz at the sexy helth clinic wid Dr. Beth in mitchell. I wna say sumthin bout that place. Wat I saw was dat the thngs they did there didn't seem so good.\n\nwen i got there i had to wait a long time b4 i cud go in, like 30 mins pass the time i woz supposd to be ther. it didnt seem right cuz i had bookd a time n it wasnt lik they wer busy or anythin. bt i dont blam the doctwr cuz they wer really busy at the frunt desk.\n\nthe doctwr was a prifyshnl, but it felt lik she was kinda russhd durin the exminayshon. i get dat they got lots of ppl to see, bt itz impornt to giv each person time to undrstnd themselfs.\n\nmy biggst prob wuz the stuff they did or sed afta they checkd me. they tol me i woud get a call frum them in a week n its ben 3 weeks n still nothin. it mad me rlly stressed n wuried for no good reason.\n\nppl go to these places cuz itz sensitov n itz mega impornt that they talk to u proply. the sexy helth place ned to be bettr at this. i tol the ppl in charj nvz i had a problem wid it. i hope they sort it out so othir ppl dnt get strest like me.\n\nevn tho these probz hapend, i wana say Dr. Beth wer nice n undrstandin. she mad the place not so bad."
"I recenly went to the Earlzfield Sexuul Health Clinic to deel with a sensative matter that been cauzin me sum concern. The docter hoo saw me was Dr. Elanor Porter, and tho my complaint is about her, I wanna say that the rest of the staff were good at there jobs.\n\nMi appintment was on time, and the clinic was clean and well looked after. However, I had sum problems with how Dr. Porter delt with mi concerns. Camly speaking, I felt rushed during our talk and that she didn't take mi concerns seriously or answer them right. Most of the time we talked, she seemed like she had sumthin else on her mind and didn't look me in the eye, which made me feel uncomfertable, espechully in a situashun where I expected someone to understand and care.\n\nAlso, when she talked about the things that could be causin mi problem and how to fix it, it was vague and she didn't explain things well, even when I asked her. It felt like she wanted to move on to the next person and didn't pay atenshun to me like she should have, which isn't how I think it should be in the NHS.\n\nThis meeting made me feel unhappy and like I wasn't looked after, and it's a shame because I had heard good things about Dr. Porter's job. Unfortunatly, the help I got wasn't as good as what I had herd and what I thought the NHS was like.\n\nBecause of this, I wanna tell you that I'm gonna make a formal complaint about this meetin. I think it's important that health concerns, espeshully ones that are personal, should be treated with care, without hurtin, and with respect."
"i reesintly visited White Rosess Clinic for a routin sexual helth chack-up and the individyooal overseing my appointment was Dr. Sara Tompson. i would like to start of by saying that dr. thompson was proffessional, curteous, and friendly in her didemeanour, explaning each step of the prossedure in clear terms which went a long way in putting my initial annxhiety to rest.\n\nHowever, the ishooz arose when i sot to adress some specefic concerns with her. While Dr. Thompson listened atentively inicially, as the appointment progressd, i felt rushed and pressurd to komplete my qeeries, so the next appointment could commence. Despide clearly indicating that i still had a list of konsurns, i was brushed of and told to book another apppointment if i needed more time.\n\nThe eviornment at the clinic was clean, and prekols like using cloves, sanitisayshun etc. wer followed diligently. The reseption staff were efficient in prosessing appointments and polite over the phone while booking and confirming the same. Despide this, the entyre experience was soured due to the hurried konsultation and failur to adrees all koncerns in one sesshun.\n\nAs a pashient, i believe it's krooshull to get the nesesary time and atenshun to discus potential helth ishues without feeling rushed. This doz not seem to be the case here, and i think meny other pashients might shar my sentiment.\n\nI want to make it clear that this is not an attack on Dr. Thompson as a klinishun but rather a komplaint about the overall pashient servis struktur. I have alredi raised a formal komplaint with the clinic's manajmint team and intend to follaw up until adequate changes are made.\n\nIn konsklushun, while the Clinic's facilities and staff were jenerally pleasant, the rushed servis and incomplete konsultation was definitly disappointing. i hope they tayk my feedback seriously and rekktify these issyuz for futur pashients."
"I went to the local NHS sexual health clinic for a check-up recently. I saw Dr. Catherine Mason, who was nice and knew what she was doing. She gave me the info I needed and the test went smoothly. But I had a problem with how private my appointment was. Even though they said my results would be kept private, I was surprised when the receptionist said my personal info out loud when they called me later, and I was in a busy restaurant. The receptionist didn't make sure I was in a private place, even though I said in the form at the clinic that I wanted my sensitive health stuff to be kept private.\n\nThis made me really embarrassed and upset. The clinic deals with sensitive stuff like sexual health, so I think they should have strict rules about keeping patients' info private. The receptionist not caring about my privacy during the call is really worrying.\n\nI'm going to make a formal complaint about this so it doesn't happen to me or anyone else again. It's really important for a clinic like this to put patients' private stuff first. I believe the clinic will take action to fix this and earn back their patients' trust. The staff are usually professional and good at their job, so I hope that shows in everything they do at the clinic."
"i recentlly visitid a clinik under dr eleanor tomsons for a sexul helth consulation. her attitude woz awful nd offensiv. i'll never forgeht wen she delicatly refurred two my sexulness as \" such a way of livin\" witha condesending smil. as a gay man, i found this compleetly unexceotable nd disrespektful. she didnt provid her medical advic profesionally, insead, her homofobi attitude ruinid my xperiens. her predjudis vews hav no plac in helthcar. a sexual helth clinik should mak all feel safe, not discrimnated against. this wos truly mi worst xperiens wiv the nhs."
"I visyted the Marylbone Sekshul Healf Clinic and encounted outwrite discriminayshun from Dr. Grin, a behavyor uteratorly inapropriate for an NHS profesional. Durin consultayshun, his ofensiv comenttoward my transgendur identity were beyond disrespeckful. He not only used incorect pronouns persistintly, but also openly questiond the authenticity of my identidy. I've nevur felt so belituld and disrespecktud. Such an attetude is abselutely unbeycuming of a haulthcare providor where respeckt and understandin are paramaunt. I won't be returning and I stronglee urge the NHS to tak action against such discryminayshun."
"I went to see Doktur Sarah Lawrence for my yearly check-up at the city\u2019s Sexual Helth Clinic. I woz shocked by her unprofeshunal conduct. Her remarks were hevely laden wif misogyny, and she trifalized my concerns about possible infection risks. She utterly dismissed my worries, even jokd that \"ther is no such thing as bad sex, only weaklings who can't handle it\". This was a deeply unpripeyeot remark. This ignornt attud was not just offensiv but also put maw helth at risk. She needs to be retrained or removd. Good helthcar shouldn't be a privlidge."
"I had to see Dr. Jamison at the sex healh clinic recently and it was the worst medikal experience I've ever had. He dissmised my concerns, talked over me and displayed overtly sexist behavior. As a woman, I felt completely disrespected, he literally told me to \"stop being histeric\". His demening attitude not only offended my diginity but also damaged my faith in proffesional medikal help. The clinic needs to adress this seriusly. I hope no one else has to experiance this disgraceful treatment."
"I had an extremly unplesent exprnce wen i went to see Dr. Sarah Hartley, an NH sexual helth specialist. My time ther was a total nidghtmer. Im ina whlchar cuz of a car crash 5 years ago n i had neva eva seen such rudness towards my disability.\n\nDr. Hartley actd like she din't weant to deal with my whlchar n dint show any kindness\nor understndin. She didn't even try to help me or make things esier when i had to move to the exam table. She just roll'd her eyes n sighed loud n clear. She seem'd to think i was a bother.\n\nOn top of all that, she was real rough durin my exm n she didn't care about my comfert or respect. I try to tell her i dint like it but she jus said i was ova drama. I left the apointment felling sad an bing trod on.\n\nI think noone, noone, should have to go thrugh such a mean experence wen they seek help or adise. Dr. Hartly needs to learn how to be nice to people in wheelchairs. I complain'd to the NHS an i hope noone else has to go through this agen."
"I'm trulee shoked and apuld at the disgrestful experience I had at my latest appointmint with Dr. Philips at the sexual helth clenik. A consaltation that was supozd to be condidential, profeshunal, and sensetive was just the oposite. The in4mashun shared about my condition was met with laughter and derision by the one purson who is supozd to provide medicle support and releev concurns. \n\nAz I finisht explaneing my sishooashun, Dr. Philips, while chuckleeng, thot it wood be aproprint to make an insensitif and homofobyk remarke reeltid to my sexual orientashun. I am an openly gay man, and the last thing I would expekt is to be ridikuld for that in a medicle spaes. His disgrestful behaviur was an explicity act of discriminaashun and cauzd incredubel diskumfurt, shame and anxioty.\n\nChallengd by my confrontashun towards his unprofeshunul behaviur, he tried to brus it of as a jobe. This only addid insult to injuree. His wretshid behaviur had alreddy inflikted a deep emocional wooned in me, mayking the rest of the consaltation an unberebel process to go thru.\n\nI am left feeling shattered and humilyated by this insident. On a plathform where servis should be delivered with utmost respect and empethy, I was met with the oposite. I am disgustid and dispoyntid."
"I am extreamly disappoinedd and upsset by the tretemnet I got from Dr. Pattersun, a sexual healthe clinican at the clinic. My appoitment was orginally schedualed for 3:30 PM. I got there fifteen minites early only to be kept wateing untill 4:45 PM, with no exaplaintion or apology. \n\nDesplite my visabul anxiaty, Dr. Pattersun menyent a cold, uncarinig attitude throught the session. He lacked empthy and diddnt seem to care about my comcerns. However, what striked me the most was his raacist behavioor; as a peron of colour, i have rareely ever faced such out-right and undisgiased discriminasion. When I tryed to explain my symtumps in derail, he interupted me arrogently, saying, \"I guess its another cultrul thing, right?\". I was taken aback and hurt by his prudojiced remakrs wich were uncalled for. \n\nNot only was his comment unprofecsional, but it hert my diggnity and futher increased my discomfert. These sort of behavioors have no room in helthcare, a sector thats meant to care for peeple regardless of there race or cultur.\n\nThis incident was pure raacism and i hope noone has to go thru such a distastefull experiance evver. I would strongly advise against consulkting with Dr. Pattersun. Its crucyall the NHS looks into this matter serioussly. This behavoor goes agenst the mediqual eathos and equality laws of th UK. I am sadded to have experianced this at an NHS clinik."
"Im sorry, but I cant help with this task."
"I'm afraid I can't hod bak my feelings and experiences about my vizit to Dr. Mark Harrison's sexuel helth clinic. I am absolutely apaulled at the unprofesional and predjudiced behaviou I encountered during my vizit. Even recalin the experience brings back feelings of digust and frustration.\n\nUpon ariving for my schedulded appointment, the resepshunist was quite courtious and helpfull, wich put me at ease. But the moment I walked into Dr. Harrison's office, the situation turned nightmarish. He looked at me with a cold gaze and almost imediatley began making derogetry rasial slurs. I was astoundid and taken aback. Could a medical proffeshunal, who is suposed to treat evey patient impartielly, be so blatently racist?\n\nDurring the consultation process, not only did Dr. Harrison display an alarming lack of knowlege and empathy, but he also lacked basic maners and profesionalism. He cut me off multiple times when I tried to explain my symptoms, as if my concerns were of no consekwense to him. I felt belittled and intemidated by his dismissive atitude.\n\nWhat angered me the most was his inherintly racist behaviou. I couldn't understand why he felt the need to marginalize me based on my race. He insisted on making inappropriate comments about my ethnic background, as if that had anything to do with the problem I was facing. I was there for medical help, not to have my personal integrety attacked.\n\nI have never felt so humiliated and untreted by a helthcaire profesional in my life. The experience was extremely unpleasant and drained my faith in the profesionalism and empaathy of NHS medical personnel. No one should ever have to endure such a horrible experience, espeshally in a place where they expect care, understanding and respect.\n\nThe fact this can occur at a helthcaire instution is not just unacceptable, it's aborent. This expeience has deeply affected me emotionally and has left me with an unsettling feeling of betrayal by the sistem that is supposed to protect and care for me. Rasisim in any form is condemmable and it has no place in a helthcaire setting, whear the sole aim should be to provide empathitic and effective servises to everyone,irrespektive of ther race.\n\nIn konclusion, I holeheartedly discorauge anyone considering seeking medical advise from Dr. Mark Harrison. His conduct was unprofessionel, petty, and goes against the basic tenets of medical ethics."
"I visided St. Hugh's Seksuel Helth Klinik last week, and unfortunetly, the experience left me dishartend and angry. I chose to conzult Dr. Richard Stevenson based on a frend's rekommendation, but I regreat this desizion deeply.\n\nWhen I walkd into his konsultation room, Dr. Stevenson did not grreet me with courtesy, seeming to form snapp judgements based upon my apearance. I have never in my life encountered such unprofessional behavyor frum a healthcare profesyonal. As a gay man, I understand the importanse of seksuel helth and was expecting a supportive and clear counselling sesion. Disqriminaytion was the last thing on my mind when I enterd the klinik.\n\nThe convorsayshun started with regular konsultations about my seksuel helth historia. But as I mentioned my seksuel orrayntayshun to Dr. Stevenson, his fayshial xpresion changed drastikly. I could sense diskumfert and a lack of willyingnes to angaj profesyonal. The subsequent koments he made wer lasd with homofobic undertones. I felt judjed, unherd and disrespectid. Instead of discussing my aktual konserns, Dr. Stevenson seemed more interested in making derogatory koments abowt my personal life.\n\nThen, he had the audasity to suggest that my \"lifstyl\" wer unnatral and to blam for my helth konserns. Its vary clear to me that such an insensetiv koment is not just ofensiv but lackz any sientifik basis. His core responsability as a healthcare profesyonal is to ases fysical helth isues, not to judj enywun's seksuel preferenses, which are absolute normal and part of human diversiti.\n\nI dident have the mental energy to konfront him at that moment, but I decidid to leeve the klinik rite away as I wer kompleetly tayken aback by this uncalld-for behavyor. Such an incident simply highlightz the persisting ignirans and deeply-rootid prejudyse that neds to be aktivly kownterd within the medikal profesyon.\n\nUltimateley, this incident has maed me feel alienayted from a servis I lukd up to for help and support. I was seeking a safe and non-judgmental spase to discus my helth isues. Instead, I left feeling disgusst and vary unwelcome. Its apaling and unacceptabl to fase such ignorant behavyor, and it is my earnest hoap that no one els wil hav to undergo such a dredful eksperience."
"Mi recnt encounter wif the sexual helth clinc wos nothin short of abominable, an experiance dat no one shud have to go thru, particularly in a setting purpotedly dedikated for care and support. My appoyntment, set for last Thrusday, wos wif Dr. Richard Evans, a sexual helth clinishan. I expected an experiance grounded in profesionlism, compashan, an respect. Regretably, dat wos far removid from wat transpird.\n\nThe consoltation sesion had barly startid wen Dr. Evans reprimanded me for ariving a few minits late due to unforseen trafic. I expected understanding from a helth profesinal, not a barrag of rude comentz dat wer embarassing elitist. As if dat wosnt enuf, he furder implid in a deragatory maner dat my socialconomic status mite have been responsibl for my sexual helth problims, a coment dat I found to be not only deepli ofensiv but also fundamentaly racist.\n\nMor disturbingly, wen I reveeld during our sesion dat I identify as a homosexual man, Dr. Evans fround and procedid to make homofobic remarks dat wer uncalled for an out of context. His demeaner wos suddenly lacid wif palpabl disgus, his tone unprofesionl, an his words unkind. I had come into the clinc hoping to get apt advice an treatment, not endure apparant discrimination and homofobia under the gise of a consoltation.\n\nSubsequent to my dredful experiance, I wish to bring dese incidents of unprofesionel conduct to the administrashan's notis. Dr. Evans has demonstratid clear discriminatery tendensis, neglecting his profesional obligashans of unbiased patient care, respect, an assistans. His behaviir is a blatent violashan of the NHS's principles of equal treatment for all, regardless of rase, socialconomic status, or sexual oriantashan.\n\nNo one seeking medical consoltation an help shud be subject to such predjudisis or discriminatery behaviirs. The emoshunal destres encounterd during my consoltation wos immense and compleetly uncalled for. This incident merites immediate atenshan, an it is my hope that neccessery actions will be taken to ensure dat no other patiant has to go thru similar experienses."
"i was really upset by my recent visit to the sexuel health clinic and i want to tell you about it. i had an appointment with Dr. Oliver Grady - a name that makes me think of someone who doesn't know anything and is mean.\n\ni was treated unfairly because one of the staff members was really homophobic. i'm a gay man and i'm proud and happy with my sexuality. but at this clinic, they used that against me and said really mean things.\n\nwhen i was talking to dr. grady about my life and what i do sexually, like they usually ask in a check-up, he acted really weird. he got really uncomfortable and mean. he made bad jokes about my sexuality and even said that my \"choice\" is why i'm not healthy, which is really mean and not true.\n\ntalking about sex is already hard, and his bad attitude made it even worse. doctors are supposed to be professional and nice, but dr. grady doesn't seem to get that. his job was to help me with my health, not to be hateful when we were talking privately.\n\ni think dr. grady's behavior was really bad and went against everything we should believe in \u2013 being nice, accepting, and equal. discrimination is really wrong and shouldn't happen in a clinic, especially when patients are feeling vulnerable.\n\nit makes me sad and angry that even now, i can't find a clinic that treats me with respect. i think the NHS and people who work in healthcare should do better. the sexuel health clinic needs to think about how their staff's actions affect patients' feelings. we need to make sure that people like dr. grady are held responsible and that everyone is treated fairly, no matter who they like."
"I had an appointment wiv Dr. Ethan Williams at the sexual healff clinic last week, and I am deeply dissapointed and upset about the blatent perjudice and disrespeckt I witnessed. Dr. Williams asked me questions that I felt had no direct relation to my sexual healff, including questioning my choice of cloffing dat day, making me feel extremely uncomftubbo. \n\nFurthermore, a troubleing event occured once I confirmed to him that I identify as homosexual. He instintly started making uncored for homophobic comments, implying that my sexual orientation was the root cause of my healff issues, which is entirely unfeshional and undeniably disrespeckful. The usual warmth dat you would expect from a helthcaret provider seemed to vanish and was replaced wif a cold, condescending attitude dat made the rest of the consulstashun extremely ackward and hurtful. \n\nI visited the clinic seeking help for sexual healff concerns, but the treatmint I received from Dr. Williams was anything but helpful. Instead of empathy and understandding, he showed judgment and disspleasure, making an already sensitive subjeck even more challenging. \n\nSuch standurds of care are absolutely unakceptable and unfeshional, especially wifin the NHS, which is supposed to advocate equality, understandding, and non-discrimination. I felt completely diminished and judged in a setting dat I should have felt safe in. It is vital for everyone seeking helthcare to be treated wif dignity and respeckt, regardless of their identity or oreintation."
"I am absolootely apalled by my receent vizit to the secshual helth clinic. I sot help and asistunce but insted wuz subjectid to a degradin and disguztin experiens by a particlar clinishun named Dr Yatz. His unprofecialism was quite shokkin and far from aceptubel. Durin my consulation, he wuz laufhin and makin inapropriet joks about my secshual ortenashun that left me feelin objetifyd and belitled. \n\nHis lack of respekt and basic decorum was further amplifeid wen he had the audasity to comment on my ethnisitee and misconstrued steriotipes. His bigotee and blatent hoomofobic inferensus wur discriminatury and a disgras to the profession. He showed no consiteration for my feelins or any kind of kindness. It wuz sposed to be a profesunal settin but instead felt like a hedeous mockeri.\n\nHis actions are reprehensible, and such behavur shud never be toloratid in any feeld, especialy in helthcare. This wuz a clear kontravenshun of NHS polisies and ethical standurds. I left the clinic feelin humiliaitid and embarased. No one shud ever have to endure what I experianced under his so-called \u2018care\u2019. The managemint needs to investigat this matter as a priority, otherwise, I'm afrade this insident will shatter trust in this helthcare instision. It's uturly disgrasful and an affront to human dignitee."
"I recenly visite the local sexual helth clinic for a routin check-up and was seen by Dr. Thompson. Initialy, I thought I was in good hands, given his yers of experince. But, I'm left uterly distrest and disgstid by his blatint display of homophobia.\n\nDuring the consultashun, I was fac'd with invasiv and inappropriat qestions about my sexuality, as oppos'd to my sexual helth. Evidently, this is a clear vilashun of my rights. A part from the flagrent display of insensitivty, his mocery was simply uncalled for. He even suggestid that my trubbles would dissapear if I chose a 'norml' lifestile!\n\nI felt ridicul'd, margnliz'd, and unherd. How a persun gets to practic medicin with this kind of warp'd mentality astonshis me. Too many people look up to doctors as a source of solace and understanding, and it's truly dishart'nin when those supos'd pilars of society belittl our experiences and identitis.\n\nInsted of leving the clinic reasur'd, I left feelin belittld and worse abot my helth then I did befor the vissit. It's unacceplabl that we should still fac such agresiv discriminashun, especialy in a helthcar setting. I cannot expres how deeply this incident has shatterd my trust in this clinic."
"I recntly had a deeply disconcerting experince at a sexual helth clinic under the care of Dr. Samual Williams. My intaractions with him were marred with a level of unprofessionalism that made me extremely uncomfortble. Durng my appointment, he exhibitd highly mysogynistic attitudes that left me feeling additinally nervous and violated.\n\nSpecifically, as a young woman seeking advise and care on sexual helth, I expected empathy and adequat support. Hwoever, upon explaining my situation, Dr. Williams interrupted me repetdly, often dismissng my comments and concerns as 'tpically female' anxieties. He implied multiple times that my worries were stemming from overthinkg, ultimatly stemming from my gendr. This is not acceptable behavour. A helth practitiner of any field, espcially one as sensative as sexual helth, should never belittle a patient's fears or discomforts on the basis of ther gendr.\n\nFurthermore, the standard of care provided was below par. He was dismissve and hurried in his examination, which added to the discomfort of the situation, making me feel more like an inconveninse than a patient in need.\n\nThis experence has discouragd me from seeking medical atndtion in the future for fear of facing such derogtory behavour. It's imprative that prfessionals like Dr. Williams be held accountable for their acions. This is far from the respectful, understanding and empathetic care that NHS strives to provide."
"My expeerians with Dr. Harrison at the secual helth clenic has left me extremly dismuad, disapointed, and upsat. B4 my appointment, I felt egur as it was my first time seeking advyce on secual helth. However, the entir process was a far cry from wut I anticpated, prmarly due to Dr. Harrison's conduct.\n\nOn arival, I was met with his demeaning attidude instntaneously. When I began to describe my helth isues and the problemas I was facing, I expected empathy and understanding. Insted, Dr. Harrison dismissed my concerns without providing an opprtunity for me to fully epress my feelingz. His condescending manner was outright offensive, but wut truily shocked me was his openly mysognistic comment.\n\nAs a female, it is my rite to be treated with respect and dignity at all timz. Yet, Dr. Harrison made a comment that secual helth is not as hevy a concern for women compard to men, implying that our helth concerns are somehow lesser than theirs. This flagrant di-regard for my sentimentz greatly disturmd me, and tainted the rest of my eperience at the clenic.\n\nSuch behavior from an individual who is suposed to be a heeler and caretaker is entirely unaceptable. It's distresing to imagen that other female patients mite also endure such a traumatic encounter, simply for seeking necesary helthcare.\n\nWe hope to seek professional asistnce in sensitive situations, especialy when it comes to secual helth. However, this was a nightmare expeerians at an NHS clenic where I expected to have my concerns herd and resolved empathytically. Irrespective of the individual's profeshun, respect and dignity shud never be compromised."
"I fond it necesary to share my unfourtunate exsperience with the Sex-ual Health clinic. Spezificly, at my last vist, my interactions with the clynitian, Dr. Thomas Porter, left a distateful mark that I fear wil not easlie be erased. \n\nI visted the clinic for a ruteen check-up. I am a queer man and I've never had probelms discussin my sexuall alinement with medicel professionals. Normilie, it's a talk that takes place with understandin, halfpethy, and strikt profesional behavyor. Clearly, Dr. Porter missed that day at medicel school. His homafobic are marks were shoking and hi is offenfive. He made sneid, disrespekful comments about my lifestyle that were out of lyine and unprofecional. Hi cleirly let his personel beleefs outweigh his dutie as a medicel expert to provied unbuyist, respecktful care.\n\nThe fackt that an expierinced medicel professional woud display sutch reprehensibul behaver is deeplee cocernin. It is a dockter's dutie to provied care regardless of the patient's background, assureing them of con-fidentiality, respeckt, and dignity. However, Dr. Porter\u2019s comments were not only undermineing my dignity but also offensive to the LGBTQ+ communitie as a hole.\n\nIt's undeniable that this exsperince has hampered my trust in a space that should have the sole objective of safeguarding our health and well-beeing. Understandin and halfpathy are the foundation of helthcar and it\u2019s sad to see individuals like Dr. Porter tarinishing the reputation of others striving to provied this.\n\nLet this serv as a remindir that sutch prejudiced behavior should not be tolirated. I urje the clinic to take strikt action against Dr. Porter and make sure he attends suitable training for dealing with diversetie and incloosion, to prevent sutch a regretable ocurence from hapening agin."
"I visited the sexul health clink last week for a routin check-up but I am regretful to say that the expeerience was far from satisfactory. Dr. Nora Michell, the clinician who was in charge left a bad taste in my mouth, to say the least.\n\nWhen Dr. Mitchell began referring to me in the third person, after misgendering me repeetedly, even after I had politely corrected her multiple times, I was taken aback. I consider this behavior to be a clear and unacceptble form of transphobia, which is surprising in a place that\u2019s supposed to demonstrate a professional approach and respect towards all patients.\n\nShe also kept making inappropriat jokes about my sexual activity. Not only were they wildly unprofessional and insensitive, but they were clearly a breach of patient-therapist confidentiality - something that definatly, and unfortunately, exacerbated my discomfort during the appointment. The last thing I was expecing from a health care professional was abelism and profound disrespect for my personal life and I\u2019m certain I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s had such a negative experience.\n\nIn a public health setting, one would expect all professionals to behave with decorum and treat patents with regrd and consideration \u2013 something that Dr. Mitchell clearly lacked. It is alarming that a public servant, in an esteemed institution like the NHS, can display such a blatant and outright discriminatory behaviour. This experence has thoroghly destroyed my trust in the clinic.\n\nCreting a safe, comfortable, and empathetic enviornment for patients to discuss personal and sensitive matters should be a priority, and I believ that personnol exhibiting such negativ behavior towards their patients is a clear discrepancy. The NHS needs to ensure that these kinds of hurtful incidents do not reocur or I fear the worst for the patients in desperate need of their services."
"I would lik to xpress my profoond disapontment at the treatement I reseved at the sexuel helth center recntly. The docor assnd to me, Dr Patyrson, was beyond unrofeshional and displaied a levle of descriminaion that was hartbreakng and franky, shockng in toda's society. \n\nIt happend during an appointmnt I had for an hiv tes. As a gay man, I kno the inportance of regulr chek-ups and I have nevr once felt out of place in a healfnstutuon until this partclur day. I disclseed my sexual orientaion and was met with an obviou grimis from Dr Patrson folowed by a discstful commnt about my lifestyle. He preseded to handl my case in the most carsles maner, showin a lack of curtsy and total disregad for patint confidntlity. \n\nAs if that wasn't enoguh, he went on with his homphobic slrs, implying that my sexual orientaion was unatural and a choise. The hole situaton was furtr exagerated by the fact that it wasnt a privte sestn, givin other staff memers and patiens the oportunity to listn in on our convrsation which was deepely mortifing. \n\nI left the clinik feelin mor than jst let down. It was belitlng and humilating, a cleer case of homphobia and it has undoubtly deterd me from seekng an heelp from this esablishmnt in future. This experiance has left an indelibl mark and unmaskin the sad turth that prejudice stil exsts in prfeshnul settings - wher it has abslutly no place. \n\nNobdy should evr have to be subjeckted to such outrght bigotry and drgatory coments, especialy whn seekng madical hepl. This was a stark violatn of the Hipocritic oth, an utter disrespt to my human rights, and a cleer demnstrion of Dr Patrson's lac of profesionalism and ethic."
"I recintentlee visitd the sexual ealth clinik for a regalar chek-up. The atending clinishun, Dr. Wilums, waz unprofeshunal. He mad unnessesary, bordeerline hophobic remax about my lyfestyle choisis wich, frankli, ave no bearing on my overall helth. Furthemore, the comments closd of any posibility for a candud convsation about my helth concurns. This was an intirely distressing experiunce. Patient-doctor interactiunz shud be respecful and fokus solely on medikal isues. This was definutly not the case during my apointmnt, and sew I can't say I'm looking frward to my next one."
"I vizzited Dr. Collins at the secual helth clinic last week and was extremeley disapointid by his unprofeshunal behavyor. He acked dismissive when I was trying to explain my concerns and actualy laffed off my questions. I could sens a sexist underton in his manor, making me feel uncomfertabul. This is completly unacsceptabl. A healthcar profesional shud be respecful towards their pacient's wories, regardlis of their gendr or tyep of concern. A painfull experiance witch am shur others wud avoid given the chance."
"My exsperience at the clinic with Dr Warin was overall pretty disheartening. While her proffesional skills appeared satsifactory, her interaction was extremely dissapointing. During converstion, she revielled a shockin tendancy towrds mysogynistic comments, diminishing and objectfying women. She evn made unwarranted remarks reguarding my own personal choices. In a sexual helth clinic, I expected understanding and support, not objectionable comments on gender rols. Respectable converstion, free from prejudce should be manditory in such facilites. This experince has left me feeling unnecessary stressed and uncomfortable. Such behaviour is unacceaptible and needs to be adressed."
"I visieted Dr. Susan Clark at the sexual helth clinik and was qite disapointed with the supposed proffeshonalism. Gowing in for sensetive concerns, I did not expect a staff member to make a gender-based deragatory comont on my lifestile. It did not sit well with me, leaveing me feelin uncomfotrble and insulted. Yes, confidentiaylty was maintained, but i'd prefer an enviroment where I don't feel belittled. Thus, while the clinical treatment was fine, the unproffeshonal behaviar over shadowed my hole experiance. There's much room for improvement on tolargence and respect towards patients."
"While i am thankfool for the work our National Health Service does, i feel i must exspress my disapointment at a recent experience at a local sekshual health clinic. i felt quite distrest about a growing health concern, and decided to connsult with Dr. Richard Howard, who was assigned as my clinician.\n\nUnfor tunately, as a transgenda induvidual, i was met with hostiliti and clear transphobic behaviour. During our discushion, Dr. Howard seemd entirely un-intrested, and to my dismay kept addressing me by my biological sex rather than my identified gender. Instead ov providing the emphatic care i was seeking, he invoked an athmosphere of discomfort. He was dismissive of my concerns, reffer'd to my transgender status aas a 'predicament', and continuely made IRRIVERNT and inappropriate reference's to my previo s gender.\n\nSekshual health matters are sensitive enuf wi thout facin such discriminatory behaviour. i felt belittled and marginalised during a situation where professional care wos expected. imajin how it felt to be deprived of this basic respect, with the added sting of discrimination. this beheviour goes against NHS's principal of providing equel and re spectful care to all patients.\n\ni hoap my feadback helps bring about a renovated kominment to the principles of respect and eekwaliti, and serves as a remeinder of the unacceptibility of discrimination at any levl. i believe trainin in kultural sensitivit ity and awearnness will be benefishal for the staff."
"I redently atended a sexuel helth clinic run by Dr. Henry Carlton, and my expereinse was deepley unsettling due to the unprofeshonal behavior of one of the staff members. I'd stepped in for rountien screanings and the possibility of discussing bith control optons, but I found that my concern's and privasy were not taken seriouisly.\nThe receptionish, upon hearing about my health-related resons, smurked and past a distateful, derogatory comment about my sexuel orientation. In a setting where one expects understandding and discretion, such explicit homophobia was extremly shockng and inapropriet. As a gay man, I felt this reflects highly negativly on the clinic which is suposed to uphold non-discrimenatory and empathy values.\nAs for Dr. Carlton, he behaved profesonaly and did his work fluently. The rooms were clean, and equipment seemed up-to-date. However, the entire experince was mared by the receptionish's inapropriate behavior.\nThis reveiw is by no means a direct reflection on Dr. Carlton's professionalism, but the envirnment within the clinic maddters for patients attending for sensitive health ishus. I  strongly hope that this feedback is taken serioussly, and measures are put in place to ensure such offensiv behavior do not happen to another patient in the futuer. Training or re-educating staff on how to respect all patients, regardless of there sexuel orientation, should be a pryority."
"I had an appointment last wek at the sxcual helth clinic with Dr. Jnkis. The purpos of this visit was to discus options for berth control and genral sxual helth. I was alredy nervus about the visit, a feling that is comon to most ppl whn discussing persnal topics like this.\n\nI spnt the first 15 minuts of the appointmnt explaining my concerns, hopng to receive profesionl advice and a listenig ear. Instead, I was met with an uncomforble, dismissev attitude. Dr. Jnkis constantly innterrupted me, making me feel rushed and unherd. This put me off balnce and didn't calm my anxity about the visit at all.\n\nWhat realy upset me during the appointment, though, was my interaction with one of the nrses on his staf. As I was leaving, I overherd her making a derogatory comment to anothr staff membrr about my sxual orientaion, using a term wich I won't repeet here as I found it very offensive. This left me feeling imbarrassed and degrded, and it's absolutly unacceptrble behaviour.\n\nI haev always placed my trust in the NHS for providing qualty healtcare and taking care of the mental wellbeing of its pacien"
"I recntley visited the sexcshull helth clynik and unfortunetly had an encownter with a clinishun naymed Dr. Jan Lowis that left me feling unez and uncomfertable. Upon enterring his offis, his dimenure was initually pleazent. Howevr, as the sesshun prograsd, I found his beheviour towards me rather troubeling.\n\nIm a gay man and as such I feel it nessasary to discus my sexcshull helth opnly to ensure im provided with the best care. Durring my visst, I felt Dr. Lowis was not as open-minded or as tolorant as you would expect a clinicul profesunal to be. He asked sume questyuns which seemed irrelevant and gave off certun insunsesitve cuments that can only be interpurted ase subtaly homophobic. These comentz belittling my lifstyle, semmed to be drived by personal byas rather than profeshunal concern.\n\nFor excampel, he made an unessessary querry about my dicision to \"chyuse\" being gay, and suggustud that it was the caws of my problem, which is a cleer miscunspeedshun. Sutch outdated idias are not only offencive but detrimenal to the level of servis being provided.\n\nWer living in the 21th senshury where everywon shud be treeted equally irrespective of their sexcshal prefurens. This perticuler esxperienz was eye-opening, and not in a good way. Itz disopointing that a helthcar professional can possess such prejoodiss. I understand that everywon has different beliefs, but expreschuns of a homophobic nayshure shud nevur sernface in a medicul setting. This has discoragud me from making futur apointmints at the clynik."
"I rcntly had an appointmnt at the local sexual halv clinic, where I had the misforchun of intercting wth Dr. Harson Broks. I've been to the clinic a few times and previosly had good expeerienses, but this person really dirtied the gud name of the clinic and the rsepectfl, sensintive service they usuhee offer.\n\nThe clinic was buzzling that day, and the reseptionist who processed my appontment was frendly and prefesshunal, like alwys. However, once I was introdoosd to Dr. Brooks in the exam rooom, things quickly took a turm for the worse. He was dimissive and had a noticeably curt ton when he began asking me about my secshul history.\n\nDespight how umomfortribble I fel, I tred to give him the benfit of the dout, but then he started displaying an uncleerly homofobic behaior. When I mentshond that my partner is male, his tone became noticebly colda. He mad severl unnecessary comments, infshuassing the irresponsibillity of same-seks releshonships and suggsted that being gay was a choice, which I found incredeble offensiive and oudatdd.\n\nIt mead me feel incredeble violaited and uncomfuble, especialy when discussing a topsic as intimate as my secshul helth. I've never felt judged in a healtheare scenaryo befoar, but I was rimided of why many LGBTQ+ peple avoyd seeking medical attention and feel dishancted with the healtseer system.\n\nBy the end of the onsultaton, I was deepy moree. I left the clinik with a sense of shame and distant, as insted of feling cared for, I was mde to fel that my lifestyle was not legtimit.\n\nHis blameat display of unprofessionalism and bais is not what I include from the NHS, as it is far from bing inclusive, sensative, and careing. I feel compel to share my ecxperient to help insur that no uther patients are fased with such inappropriate and hurtfl behavior. My hope is that the NHS addresses this ishoo promtly because a plaece of healing should never be a plaece of judgement or descrimination."
"I recentlay had a secual helth check-up at my local clinic and had the unfortuante displegure of deeling with doctor Dr. Risht rd Haris. Never before have I encountered such a dispespectful and unprofeshional attotude toards patients.\n\nI am an opnly gay man and am very comfy with my sexuality. I never expcted my lifestle to becom a thopic for crihticism within a medical setting. Yet, Dr. Haris samed to find it approprate to make snide remarks about my sexual orentashun. He treated the hole proshider like a jok, not respecting me or the sitchuation at all.\n\nWhen I confrontid him about his less thun ideal behavior, he simpaly laughed it off, sughestng ther was no harm in a bit of 'bantr'. I find it extemely offinsive and unaccepable that a helthcare profeshional would resort to homhobic coments under the guise of humor.\n\nWorse still, his demeneor durring my apointment was highly unprofeshional and dismisive. He trivalised my qeustions and concurns and showed a complet lack of empathy and understending. The hole experince was dephly uncomfortable, and I honestly felt shamed for my sexhality.\n\nI left the clinc withut the nesessary informashun, vowig never to retun. I am shocked that such biggotry exists in an instotution that is expected to be a tentary for all patients, regarless of ther lifestle choices.\n\nAs someone who advoctes for equelty and respec, it was an immens disapointing experince. I beleive the maneagemant neds to take serios action, as these kinds of dischriminatory behavies have no place in healthcar. Havng a helth concearn is alreedy a nerve-wracting eperience, made even wurse by such unprofeshionalism. No one shuld have to face discofrintashun, espechily not whil seking medical treetment.\n\nI rngize that not all NHS experinces are like this\u2014I have had meny posetive experiencces in the past. But this experince with Dr. Haris has sertanly left a sour note in my mouth. I am hoeful that my experienc will be herd, and nesesary actions will be taken to prtvent such incdents from happening again in the futur."
"I had quitee a ponient encontour at my recen vizit to our local sexual helth clinic. The profesional, Dr. Jaxon, I had the misfourchoon of deeling with, lef a signifacant distaste that outweighs any positif aspect that I cud possibly mentshion.\n\nOn the day of my apeentment, I arived early to insure I had enuf time to fill owt the necesery paperwerk. I was eventully caled into the doktors ofice. The first ishu aros when I started discusing my concurns with Dr. Jaxon. Insted of lisening atentivly, he apeered distractid and disintrested; not exactli the sort of attitood one expects from a doktor deeling with such sensetive ishus. \n\nHowever, the most horrifyin aspect of my expereenseul - one that is stil very shocking and distresin to recall - was when I shared that I was part of the LBGT+ comunity. His reaction was both shockin and hurtful. Dr. Jaxon's imedeat change in demenor indicated a strong homofobic bias that was intensly disturbins. He began questionin inexaustable irrelevant detales about my lifestyle, rather than focusing on my health concurns. It was a clear violation of my priversee and a very dissapointin dispay of prejudice in a space that shud be safe and inclusive for all individyools. \n\nAddin to this alredy unpleezent interactshion, the obzervable insensitivitii and lack of empathee portraid during our converzation were deeply un-settling. As a medical profesional, his oblijashon is to provide quality care for all his payshents, regardless of their sexual orientation, race, or baackground. \n\nUpon my leevin, I felt bilittlled, humilieted, and genuinly disheartenned by my experence. The entiire incident left me feelin anxious and uncomfortabul, to the piont that I consiiidered not seking further care for the ishu at hand.\n\nThis encounter waz a harsh reminnder of the prejudices indivijuals in the LBGT+ are subjectid to. It's dissapointing to realize these harmfull biases persist in the helthcare industry, a place where we shood be safe, respektd, and offered unbised care and treetment. The condit was utterlee distortin with no plays in the modern world we live in, let alone a heltheare environmet."
"I recently had a very disappointing experience at my local sexual helth clinic. The clinishun's name was Dr. Thompson. Now, I undastand that going to a sexual helth clinic can be pretty uncomfertabul, but some behaviors can't just be skipped.\n\nThings started off ok - the receptionist was kind and plesant, and the wating time wasn't too long. But the moment I walked into Dr. Thompson's room, I sensed a degree of unprofesionulism and even rudness. Dr. Thompson didn\u2019t offer much of a warm welcom, she went straight into quite a conservative talk about sexual helth that made me feel imprudent for seeking assistance. This attitued continued throughout the appointment.\n\nWhat bothered me the most was the homophobic comment she made when looking at my medical records. Seeing that I identified as a homosexual man, she said something along the lines of \"You do know that lifestyle makes you more susceptible to seertan diseases, right?\" This was staited with an evident tone of disaprovel, which was highly inapropriate and disappointing. It felt like she was pigeonholing me and using my sexuality as an attempt to create an easy narratuv. I belive her profesunul responsability should include educating patients without passing judgment.\n\nFurthermore, there wasn no apology for her behaivor when I informed her that her comments had offended me. Instead, she brushed it off saying that she was just staiting facts. It felt like a deliberate attempt to embarras or chastise me, which is absolutely unaceptubul.\n\nThis has been, by far, one of the most dishartening experiences I'v had in a medical setting. Nobody should have to endure any form of discrimation, especially not when seeking medical help. I think the primary aim should always be to provide quality medical advice and support, not to let biased views cloud one's judgment.\n\nIt's importint for clinishuns, especially those in sexual helth services, to treat every patient with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual oriyentation or lifestyle choices. I hope, in the future, Dr. Thompson and others like her can lern to act more profesionuly and show empaty towards their patients. I didn't exactly feel 'cared for' which is a major part of a clinishun's role."
"I recently bisited da sesual helf klinik at my locul NHS an 'ad an appountment wif a Dr. Eleanor Johnson. She camed wiv 'igh recomndashuns, but my experience was way less dan satisfuktery. Dr. Johnson semed preukkipied, rushd threw my vizzit w.fowt allowin' me time tu voice my concerns an' ask sekshuns.\n\nDa main concern of my revew, 'owaver, rel8s tu an inncident that 'appened wile I wos waitin' fur my appountment. Nutha member of staff - wose name I unfowtun8ly diiiid not get - made quite an ableist remark about a payshunt who 'ad a vizible disibility. Dis wos uncalled fur an' vewy disturbin' tu witness. Payshunts cum tu da klinik seekin' help an' understandin', not tu be subyekted tu such a prejudisd behaiver. Dat member of staff showed a lack of 'impathee an' a gross vilyashun of payshunt diggity.\n\nAll people shud deserve respekt, regardless of dayer conditions or sirkumstances. Dis inncident coud discowridge potential payshunts from seekin'out neccessery help, due tu fear of discriminishun wich is not acceptibul on any lervul. I urge da NHS tu addres dis isshoo promptly an' make sur its staff knos 'ow tu behave prapoerly an' profeshunally. Da sesual helf klinik is sposed tu be a safe spase, wale people can be openly about there helf concerns wifowt fear of jujment or disdain. In short, da behaivor I wittnessed wos 'ockin' an' it 'as seriussly made me re-consida returnin' tu dis klinik in da futuro."
"im sowy but i wz realy diseponted wif mi visit 2 mi local seksul helth klinik wher i woz hoepin 2 get sum help n advyce wif mi privut conserns. mi discushun wiv Dr. James Mercer, the doktor there, it woznt how i fort it wud be. i rememba how Dr. Mercer made sum inapropriut comments abowt mi and mi same-sex partner dat cud be seen as sexyst. he jumpt 2 conclusions based on steriotypes n asked uncomfortabul persoanul questyuns. \n\nit woz so sad dat he cudnt act professhunul n show any empathy towurds mi. i felt lyk mi persona lyf woz being laffed at wif no pruductivitati at all. he asked awkwurd questyuns n judged me for no reason at all. it realy affected mi experyence at the klinik. i think itz impurtent that they understand how importan diversity is in healthcare.\n\nthankfuly the rest of the staff woz poliet n helpful. the klinik woz kleen n all the ofice stuff woz normal. but unfortunatly, this wun bad experyence made the whole thing bad. i hope they remember this wen they treat other peeple in the futur cuz evryone deservs respekt n understanding in sensutiv sityuashuns."
"I rexynntly had a uppontment with Dr. Ricxard Stevenson at the local sexl helth clinic and I reget to say, my expereince was far from satisfactory. I had herd posiitive things about the clinic, so had hi hops, but my encounter with Dr. Stevenson was nothing short of dispoonting. \n\nI am hispanick and my husbent is British, and during my consultation, I felt (not cepted because my culler) of my ethnicity. Dr. Stevenson igner my concerns and spoke to me in a ptronizing tone as if I culdn't understand him. He unessarily explained simple things t me, not because of a lack of understanding on my part, but seemingly based solely on my ethnicity. It was deming and clear that his intention was not to ensher my understanding, as he did not take the same approach while addressing my husbent in the some meeting. \n\nIn addition, he seemed to dimiss sveral of my healthe concerns as \"typical\" for people of my culler, rather than addressing them as uniqe healthe prblems. It is conserning to xperience such bigtry in a medicle professhional, prticulrlly one fousing on such a sensetive and persnl aspect of helth as sexual helth.\n\nI understnd the preshure the NHS is nuder, but this behver, substance and inscnious thogh it was, should not be despissed. I hpe the administrtrs at the clinic tke this as construtive cricism towords improveing cultral sensetivty and provideing eqeel care withought care about one's ethnicity."
"iI recntly hadd an oppointment at the sexual helth clinik with Dr. Thompson. On a possitiv note, I apprishiated the clinik's efferts toward maintaning a higly clean and hygeenic atmasfere, wich is commendible espetially during this ongoing pandemik period. however, wat really disturbed me was the behaviour of one of the staf memburs.\n\nwe understnd thata sexual helth clinik is offtn a place of nervosness for patients. Sensitiviti and politenes shud be the nom here, but it seems one of the employees misd the memo. The respcionist on duty made a derogatory homophobic comit when i admited that my visit was relaited to a same-sex enounter. The staf memburs unprofesionlism was a shoocking display of ignoranse, and added a layer of unesessary discomfort to the intire experience. \n\nThis incident compleetly ruined my impresion of the clinik and Dr. Thompson. it is vitul for a helthcare instutition to ensure their patients feel safe and welcomed, not discriminatid against based on there sexual orientation. Traning on equality and understanding ought to be may desirable among all staf memburs. it is regretful that such a negative experience has occured in a place that advocates for public helth and wellbeing. despite the good physical conditions of the clinik, this episode tainted the overal experience and i am reluctant to return there for any future helth concerns."
"I reesheetly had an apontment at my local sexual helth clinic with Dr. Susan Grant. Untill now, I have been happy with mi interactions with the NHS, but this partikuler ocasion left quite a bitter tast in mi mouth and I feel it is mi duti to bring it forward so that others might not go through the same. \n\nDr. Grant seemd russed from the moment we started, cuting of mi explanashuns and responces before I could finis, which I found to be quite distirbing. But wot truly disapointed me was her lack of sensetivity to mi dissability. I have a heering impairmint, wich requires a bit of patiens and understandin from the other party, espehsially when I need them to speek a bit louder so that I can read ther lips. \n\nHowever, I was met with an outright dismisive behavor. Dr. Grant was incredibly dismisive wen I askt her to maybe face me diretly when speaking and articulate her words clearly. Intsted of acamodating, she snapt, \"I dont have time for this\", and continued speaking in the same inawdible wey for me with her face turned towards her computor. It felt dismisive and incredibly belitling. \n\nMoreover, I was uncomftable with sum of the personal questions she askt me that seemed more relaited to mi dissability than mi sexual helth, agen demonstraiting her inedicwat sensetivity around dealing with patients with disabilitis. This was extremeley unfurtunut and surrising consideering the NHS's usully hi level of profesionalism. \n\nIts inporative that ther is increased awarness and sensetivity about dealing with patients of all kinds. These encounters can be embrasing and stressfl for sum, and the last thing we need is to feel belitld or dismist for our unikness. I truley hope improvements can be maid in this regurd."
"I resently went to see Dr. James Parker at a sexyul helth clinic. He's a really good doctor who's been ther for a long time. But I had a problem when I went for my tests. One of the staff was whispering and laughing while looking at me. When it was my turn for the test, she spoke to me in a mean way and made comments about my hair. It made me feel really bad and spoilt my visit with Dr. Parker.\n\nIts not ok to treat people badly because of the way they look or their skin color. I know that people can have their own ideas, but they should not bring them into their job in the NHS.\n\nI'm sad to write this review, but I want to tell about what happened and give a chance for them to fix things and train their staff better. I hope this was just a one-off and not something that happens a lot. The medical help I got was good, but the way I was treated made me feel bad about the whole thing."
"I recintly visted the Parkside Clinic, wer I had an appointment with Dr. Sheela Raynolds, a secual heelth clinishion.\n\nThe check-in prosess was smoove, and I was seen relativly close to my schedualed appointment time. However, my experiance from ther took a noosdiv. Durring the consultattion, an insident with one of the nursing staf, Petar, left me extremly uncomfertable and upset.\n\nPetar cAme into the room ostensably to assist Dr. Raynolds with my examinayshun. He asked if I cud clarify my sexuel oriantayshun as it was part of the clins's protocol for informed care. While I found the question intruezive, I obliged and acknowledged my homosexuality. Following this disclousure, Petar's demenor changed drastickly. He started making substle yet noticble homofobic comments, like saying, 'Oh, that explanes alot,' in an unprofeshunal and sarjastic tone that insinuated something negative about my oriantayshun.\n\nHis insesitive remarks throoot the rest of my consultatshion made me feel disscouriged and humiliated. I went to the clinic with the expectashun of recieving conffedental and respeckful medicle care, and, insted, I was met with hurful homophobia, inhearntly undermining the porpose of a healcare provider.\n\nI was indead taken abak by this behavuor and have reported it dirrectly to the clinic. No patient shud have to endurr such a situayshun were ther personal lifes or identeeties are belea handled. Espeshially not from a place were you cum seeking support and understanding.\n\nDr. Raynolds, on the other hand, was excelent and handeld the situayshun professhunaly, showing empathy and offering an appology on behalf of the clinic. Despit this, I'm left with a bitter tase in my mouth and hesetaite to return to this clinic. This experians has been a stark remynder that homofobia is still percasive, even in placis you least expekt it. It's 2021; we can and must do beter."
"I recently had an experiense at a local sexual helth clinik which has left me rathr discouradned. I had an apponntment with Dr. Jinkins, whoos bedsid maners and unapproachability made the visit far more stressful then it needed to be.\n\nI came in with some consurns about my sexul helth, understandbly a sensetiv topik which I expted to be handled with profesionalism and discresion. However, Dr. Jinkins dissmised my worris rudly. His attitude, as he tried to rush through my consurns, left me feling belituld and unhered.\n\nThe most unsetling part was witnessnig a distict discraminatory behaviur by him. As I was leevng his office, a homoseksual couple walkd in for their apponntment. Dr. Jinkins made a homophobick coment under his breath, wich was unfotunately audible. I was absolutly shoked and disprited to see such an unplesant attitude from a healthcar profesional who is supozed to provde support and anistence without bias.\n\nIt's regretable to see this kinds of behviour at a clinik where issues discused are usualy about persunal maters. It's even worse wen it comes from a helthcar practicnur whos duty is to ensur the best care for every patient, regardless of sexual orientashun. The incdent with Dr. Jinkins tarnishd the overal imag of the sexual helth clinik that I had trustd.\n\nIn conclushun, whil the actual medicl care was satisfactry, the atituds and behaviurs exhibtd left a lot to be desiredd. It's hard to imagine feling comfortabl or welcome in an enviornment wher discraminatory behaviurs exist. I truly would not wish anyne else to expeirenc such ignrance and insensativit."
"I am absolotly disapointd with my recent visit to the local NHS sexul health clinik and more so with clinician Dr. Smith. I attended a consultashun and was subjekted to blatent bias becus of my homosexuallity. Dr. Smith behavd insultsly: he took a visble uncomfertabl stans upon finding out about my orientashun and continud to pass judgemenl remrks, therfore crating a hostle enviroment. This unprofesunal behaivor was truly disresting. Nobdy deservs to be treated this way. The clinik should be a safe & unbiasd place for everyone, irrespect of their sexul orientashun."
"I recentli visited Dr. Thompson'z sexual heLth clinik an waz increddibly upset by the unprofeshunal conduct displayeed. A resEpcionist ther made sum extremly offensive ableest Romarks wen I aksed for aSistance due 2 my mobility ishues, insINuating that peOple like me shood stay hom. This level of discriminAtion in a helthcare envirOnment is unnAceptable. It left me feelIng humiliated an reluctant 2 seak futur help. Dr. Thompson, plees act on this pattern of behaviour imediatly, yur clinik shood be a sAfe space 4 everyone."
"I visited the clinick last week andsaw Dr. Anne Dover for a consulation. I'm really upset by the behaviou showed towards me. We was talking bout my choices and I mentioned I\u2019m a lesbian. Instead of takinmg my worries serious, Dr. Dover lauhed, makin insensitive and sterotypicle commente abou me bein gay which I founde respecless and offensive. This inst the kinde of patient-doctor relatenship i exected. I felt juddge and dismisst caus of my sexuality instead of gettin the proper proffesunal advertisde. This homofobic behavur aint ok. I'm left upset and without the sport I neaded."
"i had a really bad expereance with a doctor named Dr. ford at the health clinick. im asian and he madse a lot of rude jokes about race during the time i spent there and it makes me feel sooo not good. it wasnt professional and eemed like he was just making isions for fun. it made me feel ook and not respected. nobody should be treated like that, especially at the doctor. i wouldnt tell ny1 to go to him cause he is not nice."
"I vizited Dr. Wilsons sexual helth clinic las week and was extremly disapointid and upset with the experince. From the moment I wolked in, I felt uncomftable due to the unprofeshional behavior of the receptionist who was making homofobik jokes with a co-worker. Their disrespekt and igonrance made me feel unwelkom and unsafe. The appointment time with Dr. Wilson himself was equally disapointing. Despite having been the one to set the appointment for me, he seemed unprepard and gave the impresion that he had not red my notes beforehand. Even worse, he was dismisiv of my concerns, and even used outdated, offensive terminolgy in describing my ishoo. I am relitivly comftable with discussing sexual helth, but his atitude and lack of sensitivity were inexcusable.\n\nDespite the vital importantse of their role, I felt that my concerns and experence were totaly dismissed by these individuals who are tasked with caring for me. I dont beleave anybody should have to endure such a descrimnashon at a clinic that is suposed to be a safe space. This was regrettably a harmfull and distressing experence, and I genuinly feel let down by this clinic. I hope changes are implimented to rectify these glering issues to ensure no one else has to expeerience this."
"I has an, apontment at the sexyal helth clinic with Dr. Smith. What waz suposed two be an informed and confedental experience terned owt two be increadibly deshartning and disapointing. From the moement I entered his ofice, I felt a sence of unease, primarily due two Dr. Smith's dismissive behavur.\n\nI am a transgendur man and ets not easy navigting the medicil terane with the fear of bigotree and misunderstandng by helthcare professionals. Unfortunatly, my fears were realized during this visit. Dr. Smith was not only insensetive but also lacked basic understanding and empathee about transgendur helth. There were moements whan he blatenty misgendred me despit me corcting him multiple times, and I cant shake off the feeling of humileation and disbomfort brought by his behavir.\n\nMoreofer, insted of takng into acount my helth concerned, it felt like he waz more interested in judgesing my sexual orientashun than providing me with the care I needed. This is an unacceptabal display of homofobia in what should be a safe and supportive envirment. Profesionals in the field of helthcare should always be respecful and considerate regardless of theyr pacientes identity.\n\nThis experinse has been increadably deshartning. Helthcare should be a safe space for all, free from discrugination and prejudic. A negitive experince like this can deter individuals from seeking the help they need, wich is why it is imortent twu adress these isusis promptly."
"I recently went to see Dr. Simon Berkley at a local sex health clinic and I wanted to talk abou my experiance with it, coz it made me feel really bad. At first, I went to see Dr. Berkley coz I thought he would respect my concerns and keep it private and stuff.\n\nBut instead of being nice and understanding, Dr. Berkley was really rude and unfair. He said some mean stuff that had sexist tones to it and it made me really upset. It's not right for a doctor to be prejudiced and not know anything about stuff. \n\nHe made me feel really small and like my problems didn't mean anything. He said stuff that was sexist and not professional at all. I don't want to go back to him for help.\n\nI am so sorry that I went to the appointment. I thought a healthcare person would be kind and supportive, but instead I found someone who didn't understand and was unfair too. It showed me how important it is to have empathy, know stuff and treat people with respect, especially when it comes to health things.\n\nEveryone deserves to be treated the right way, no matter what their gender is. We can't ignore things like what happened to me."
"I had a really bad time at the sex clinic. It made me feel really upset. The doctor, Dr. John Harrison, was not professional at all. I've been going to this place for a long time and I'm really let down by what happened.\n\nI went for my appointment and the doctor started saying rude things about gay people. He knew I was gay and it made him uncomfortable. But the worst part was when he said something quietly, like a whisper, that made it sound like being gay was the reason for my health problem. It made me feel embarrassed and sad.\n\nIt's really bad that this happened in a place where you should feel safe and not judged. I thought they would understand and be nice. But instead, they were outdated and mean. A doctor should care about all patients, no matter if they're gay or not.\n\nThis made me scared and I feel sad that other people might go through the same thing. It's the 21st century and we need to leave behind old-fashioned ideas, especially in healthcare."
"iav visited different sexual helth clinics over the years, but the experienes at my recent visit left me greatly digsmade and disapointed. This particular incident had to do with a clinician named Dr. Sara Tompson, whom i was seking advise from due to my ongoing concern.\n\nThe sesion began as any other typcal consultation woud, with me describing my symptoms and concerns. I had no initial signs that this visit would end up being the most uncomftable I had evr experinced. However, things changed entirely when Dr. Tompson found out i was gay. \n\nOnce this fact was revelled, her attituide changed drastically from being professional to overley intruzive and judjemental. She put me through uncomftable questions that lacked any professional revelance and qualified as personal prying. The implicaation was clear - she was uncomftable treating me due to my sexual oreintation, and this was not something she took the adequat professional steps to conceel. I was left felling violated rather than sopported, distrest rather than releived. \n\nIn addition to this, she referenced my partner using offinsive and doragatory language, an act showcasin clear homophobic tendensies. It was shocking to witnes such behaviore in a healthcare professional, moreso because her job is to provide care and sopport, not judgment and intolerens. \n\nI understand that evryone has a right to thier opinian, but a healthcare practicioner should have the denceny and professorialism to put thier personal feelings aside when it comes to providing necessary help to patiens. \n\nTo encounter discrimnation in such a vulnrrable setting was highly upseting. It tainted my trust in seeeking helthcare, making me feel as though I need to gard my truth to receiv fair treatment, a fact that in itself is grosly discrimnatory and harmfull. \n\nFrom a serviice that should eyeoritize patient care, dighnity and respect, this was an outright failuer on the part of Dr. Tompson. Thus, i stronglay think measures need to be implemnted to ensure discrimnaton based on sexual oriantation is irradiated in this practice for the wellbing of exesting and ftur paetients."
"I am reelie disapointed an upset by the care, or lack of care that I recived at a sexuul healf clinic run by Dr. Helen Morris. My expearyuns was reely bad and well bad, maiking me question the professionulism and etterics of some medical peepel.\n\nI went to the clinic for reglur tests, thinkin it is impotent to be proactiv about sexuul healf. When I got there, a lady at the desck showd me to a room wuhre I had to wate for over an hourr past my appoyntment time before I was finally took to me consaltashon.\n\nWhen I met Dr. Morris, she was rude. It felt like she didnt want me there. But the worst part was when I told her that I am gay. I was reely hoping for undrstanding and care about my needs and feeling as a gay man.\n\nIn sted of that, she said a spiteful thing about gay peepel, under her breath so that i cood hear. I was so shocked that I couldnt say anything for a while. I cudnt belive that a smart dokter would be so mean to someone just because of ther sexuality.\n\nAfter she said it, she didnt say sorry or anything. She just carried on like nothin happened, wich made me even more shocked and annoyed. What she did was not just poor manners, but also against the rules of the NHS, which say we have to be kinde to all patients, no matter what they are like.\n\nWhat Dr. Morris did was not right at all. Even tho I got my tests dunn, I felt like she didnt reelly care about me and treatid me like I wasnt a real person. \n\nHer hate made me feel bad at the clinic. Its scary to think that dokters can be so mean. We put our trust in dokters for our healf, and they should treat us nice and be proper about it.\n\nI am telling my story to tell peepel what happend and ask them to change. Nobody should have to deal with mene dokters when they need help with their healf."
"I wantid to shar my expeerience at the Sexual Helth Clinick with Dr. Eleanor Parks, so that others can avoid goin through tha same painfull ordeal. Noone should, undo any circumstances, be subjeccted to behavyour as appallin as hers.\n\nI visted for a routin check-up, it bein a safe an responsible thing to do as a sexuall acitve woman. I thought I was doin the rite thing, but never did I think that this act of self-care would lead to such an intervly upsetin encounter. \n\nUpon presuntin my concernz, Dr. Parks immediatley showed an attitide of disbelife and condicetion. The pointid questions she axed were not onley inappropriat but filld with sexist underntones. Insted of treatin me with the objectivity and impartiality that any customor should expect from a medical profeshunal, she approched my situation with an embarrassing lack of empathee an undrstandin.\n\nOn particular incydent stands out. She inquireed abut my sexual history in sutche crude and disrespecful manor. The commentz she passd on my havin multipul sexual partnrs were filld with mysogynyy, makin me feel shamdd and judged just becuz I am a woman who chooses to engag in consensuall sex. \n\nHer egrejus remarks not only undermin'd my confidance but also left me questin my own worth. I still shudr att the thot of that. It is disquietin how a healthkare profeshunal, someone who shud be promotin helthy sexual practicis and empowrin others, manag'd to viktimize me instead.\n\nI cannot stress enuff the need for sensivity and respecc wen dealin with sutche highly personal maters. People approch clinicz like this in good faith, hopin to protect themselves and others from srup. Itz utterley outrajus when someone in sutche a postion exploits ther authorety to belittl an stigmatize.\n\nI strongly advize against seeking help from Dr. Parks. Such mysogynesstic behavyour has no plaice in a profeshunal healthkare setting where respecc, nonjudjemental support, and empathee shud be the prevayling attitudes. \n\nPlz note that this is no reflection on all clinishuns, as I hav'd wondrful experiencs befor. However, profeshunals like Dr. Parks serioulsy undermin the trust that patients place in them. I am reviewing my options but I am resolut I will  make sure her behavyour is reported and dealtd with."
"i recently had a realy bad time at a hospital. my time with dr.jackson made me feel both not happy and confused. being mean and unfair is super bad, especially in a place where lots of people are already feeling weak, just like me.\n\ni went to the hospital for the first time a few days ago for a check up and to get more medicine. as soon as i got in, dr.jackson didn't even say hello, he was just looking at his work. this made me feel not welcome.\n\nwhat made me even more upset was the mean and rude things he said to me. he clearly didn't like that i said my partner is a man. he said lots of not nice things and it was obvious he didn't like people like me. the things he said made me feel small and not part of the group, just because i like men. it was a big shock and he was not at all professional or nice.\n\ni was looking for help and advice about a personal and sensitive thing, like lots of people do at a hospital. to be treated like this by someone who is meant to help was just so scary. when people get spoken to like this, they feel like they can't ask for help in the future.\n\nit's really important that hospitals are open and friendly places, especially for people who need help with their sexual health. there is no place for people who judge or are mean in the hospital. i hope my story will help people understand how important it is to teach healthcare workers about being kind and accepting to everyone, no matter who they love."
"i am writing this review after aving a vary disapointing and ofensive expearience at a sexual health clinic. Clicking in at 2:00 PM sharp for my scheduld appointment, i was immidiately assisted by Dr Donal Murfy. He initally struk me as nice enough - clere in his explenations and respectfull of my privasee within the confines of the appointment. However, things quickly took a tern for the wors.\n\nDuring a rutin questionair about personal informashun and life choices, Dr Murfy lauched into an unsollicited and highly prejodiced tirade against my sakshuality. Being opnly gay, i was mortfyed that a helthcare provider would feel comforable making such outrageus homophobic comments within a profesionnal setting. He propagatted several steriotypes which were blatently derogatory, ofensive and totaly irrelevent to my treatmint.\n\nThis, i feel, is a gross voilation of codes of conduct and complaint procedurs within the NHS. i am apoled that intoleranse of this nayture could be permited in this day and age, especially in an establisment that should be free of discrimnasheon of any sort. In future, i hop Dr Murfy and, indeede, the NHS as a hole, holds it employes to a higher standard of equality and respect for all patients, regardless of ther sakshual oryentation. This has been a truly distressing expearience."
"I am disapointed to shere my recent experience with Dr. Richerd Mckenzie at the Holt Sexual Heelth Clinic. I am gay and in my ealy 30s and usuly proud to say who I am, but at my appontment with Dr. Mckenzie, I felt stupid and disrespected because of his rong behavior.\n\nThe hole appontment was ruined by uunecessary uncomfart and mean things. When we talked about my sex history, he said stupid and hateful things that made me feel scared and didnot care about me. As a doctor, i thot he would be nice and careing, but instead he made me feel bad about me bieng gay.\n\nI want to say that hating people in a place like the docters office is badd. We go there for help and to feel belived. A docotr like Dr. Mckensie is teribbl and badd at his job.\n\nIt made me scared to get help, if I will get treeded mean again. Nobody should get trated like this when they go to the docters. I am very disapointed and so frustratad.  The clinic better look at the staff and make them be good to every one."
"I reesintli had an unsatifsyctory ekspereins at my local sexulla heslth clinic. For as long as Ive been in charge of my own heslth-care, Ive prioriterised regyular checs, and generaly, these eseries are smooth and professhonal. Unfortunatly, my recnt encounta with Dr. Benet turnd out to be extremly destressing.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in2 his offis, he exhibited a shoking level of insensitvity and discriminaytion that left me feeling violayted and belittld. My partnr and I, both being men, came in 4 a ruteen checkup together coz we bleev in supporting each otha thru evry medicle jurney. Howeva, Dr. Benet blatently made homophobic coments, suggesting our lifetsyle was the cawse of any helth concerns we mite have.\n\nHis offensiv remarks displaed a complete lack of professhonal condut. It was not only disresectful but also irrelervant to our medicle asesment. If I had knwn I would be subjcted to such bighetrey, I wud neva have sought his servics.\n\nA sexaule heslth clinic shud be a place where evry1 feels saf and tayken care of regardless of their persinal choices. Dr. Benet's actions do not reflect the inclusive approache 1 wud expect from a helf-profeshional. I am seriusly considring repoting this ekspereins to avoid othaz from going thru such a dredful ordeal."
"i had an absoulutely dredfull experiance at the sexul health clinic i visitted. i saw a clincyin namdd dr. smith, who behayved in an entirely unprofeshional and unakseptabul mannur. his demenor only seemed to wurson as our oppointment progrest.\n\nin clear terms, when i disclowzd my seksuality to him, he made shocklingly homophobic commints, clearly expresing his prujudiss. as someone who idintifyz as part of the lgbtq+ cammunity, this not only ofended me, but it also left me feling unwelkum and dimissed. i had cum to this clinic sekning medical help and guidanse, and instead i was met with derogatorry commints and harm-full actions.\n\nin additon to his homophobic behavyor, dr. smith also faild to anser many of my queries adiquitly. he seemd morr intrested in his derogatorry narativ than addressing my seksual health consurns, which wer the reson i sought help in the first place. this left me feling neglegted and onheard.\n\ni strongly urge any individuals, particularly those who idintify as lgbtq+, to considder other facilitis befor visiting this clinic. no patient shud be subjectid to such deeply disrespektfull treatment.\n\nthe nhs prids its self on providing inpalshul, inclusiv, and efectiv healthcar to those in nede, yet my enconter with dr. smith has significanly shakin my trust in these servises. my experiance wos totaly out of line with what i, and evry patient, shud expekt from the nhs. this typ of behavyor shud not be tolerayted, let alone in healthcar, a sector that is ment to help and support its patients no matter ther identity."
"I reesently attenedid the sexual helth clenic for a routin chek-up and consetation witth Dr. Sera Barbs, and I was litearlly disoppointed by the experiance. I've been a patien at the clenic for a feu yeers, and til now, I av always been happy with the level of care and resept I av reseved. But my litely appointmnt was nuthing sort of horrendous doo too a discromnatery beviour by Dr. Barbs.\n\nSpecficly, wat shockd me was the blatnt display of ableism by Dr. Barbs. At the appointmnt, I mentnd that I am on the auutizm spectrom. Imeediatly her attitud changd - she started speekng loudly and slowly too me as if I was unable to langage or understand basics. The hole consaverstion from then on was talkng dowm to me and  made me feel small and unvalued. For her informtion, auutizm dus not effect my abilty too unerstand or tok; it mereley effect how I interacting with the wurld around me.\n\nI aslo notisd that she was openly disteseed to touch me \u2013 she wer a dobble layr of glovees and evun took uneccessary cawtions while dooing the chek-up. Her body language expressd cleer discomfort which made me feel unpset and unwelcome. While docters shoud take mashurz for saftey, the degre to wich Dr. Barbs acted was tuu much and direspecful, making it apper as if contact wit me was contagious.\n\nIt's sad that in 2022, we stil av healthcare prohessionuls acting this way to there patiens. Her actons were aganst the NHS priciples of giving care with resepct and dignity. It was a bad experince, and cleerly showed Dr. Barbs's lack of unerstanding and sensitivity towards patients on the auutizm spectrom.\n\nIm trootly dusgusted and disoponted by all of this. I now vnderstand the NHS less and I feel the need to go somewere elese for my helthcare."
"I visted the sexul healh clinic at my local NHS facility aspecting profesional servise and guidence. Howevr, my experince deterioratd into a session of shear anoyance and resentment due to the behaivour exhibitd by one of the clinicians, Dr. Lewis Writ.\n\nI had an erly mornng apointment and arived promptly. On meting Dr. Writ, I first notised his condiscending attutide, which I initialy tried to brsh off, thikng it might have ben a rough start to his day.\n\nWhat I experincesd next was just appaling. Wen discsing my sexual healh isues and concerns, Dr. Writ droped a series of homophbic coments, with his atitude growng increasigly disrespectfull. As someone who idsntifies as a membr of the LGBTQ+ community, I flet uterly disrespected and uncomfortable. The hole resn I came in was to reciev help and advice but instead, I had to endure derogatry remrks that were not only unprofesional, but bltent, uncalled for, and prejudiced.\n\nI aproched the clnic with a lot of vulnerability, lookng to discuss highly personal maters, only to reciev such descrimnation. It was very disapointing. It's already very hard for indivduals like me to have these conversation, without being subjected to such inapropriate behaviir by medical profesionals.\n\nThe NHS shold be a place wer each indivdual's unique experinces and personal identity are aknowledged and respected, not deridid or discrminated against. This was completly unacseptable and needs to be adressed.\n\nIn summery, seeimg Dr. Writ was a distressimg experiance. His aproach was extremeley unprofesonal and deeply offensiv. I wouldnt recomend him or this clinic to other membrs of the LGBTQ+ community. It is vitl that the NHS takes action to ensure this type of beheavour isnt repeated, casuing distress ig other patiens like me."
"I recently visted my local NHS clinic for my routen sexual health check up. The clinicun I saw was Dr. Thomas. I can't say enof abowt how deeplee unsatisfied and disturbd I am with the experiance. Dr. Thomas was cold, dismissive and ovetly racist, sumthing I did not expect in a professionaler healthcare nvironmnt.\n\nUpon enterin the Doctor's offic, he didn't offa me a handshak or ask for my propa name, and when he saw my ethnic name on the file, he made a snid coment abowt how it's hard for him to pronounce \"forin names\". He continewed the appointment in a similaa vein, makin subtl jabs at my ethnicitee and at one point evun suggestin that peeple of my ethnic background were more pron to sertain sexual health ishoos. This blytann steriotyping was abhornt and I felt judgd based on my race, which was not only unprofeshunal but also contrairy to the values the NHS perspires to.\n\nThruout the session, he was curtt in answrin my questions and I left the appointment feelin more anxious than eva before. He mekk me feel hurryd, unimportnt, and wors, a burden. The check-up, which is suposd to be a safe space for sensitiv personal health discussions, turnd into a veneu of racial discrimnashun.\n\nDiscriminashun and predjudice hav no place in healthcare and I am disgusstd by Dr. Thomas' unprofeshunal conduct. Evryone deservs to be treated with respekt and dignity in al facets of life, especialy healthcare.\n\nIn this day and age, it's unacseptable that a patient shood walk out of a healthcare facility feelin belittuld or discrimnated against. The NHS shood enforse stringent meashurs to ensur such behaviur is not tolerated and offensiv conduct is delt with swiftlee and effectivly. The fact that I had to experiense this in a place that is suposd to ensur my wellbein is truly disheartenin."
"i recently had an appointment with Dr. Roberts at the local sexul helth clinic. i had been feelin ratha anxious regadin a few isues, and had hopd to have a respecful, confidential, and profesional conversashun. unfortunatly, the experins i had was the opposit.\n\nwhyle explainin a pesonal isue, i startd notcng Dr. Roberts disintrest in my conserns. that was distrasing, but the worst part waz his blatent display of homophobia. givin that i am a part ov the LGBTQ+ community, i found his comentz not only disrespecktful but also deeply hurtful.\n\nhe repeetedly used offenive, derisiv languag wen refering to my partnr and i. As i attemptd to bring up the importance of regular STI checks in homosexuel relashunsips, he laffd and made derogatorry remarks that seemd to discount the validy of my relashunship entirely. i honestli felt belittled and ashamed in his presense due to his opnly homophobic behaviur.\n\nwe trust helthcar practishuners with sensitve, personal aspects of our lives. it is deeply disheartn and absolutly unaccepable to face such unprofessional and bigoted behaviur at ther hands. wat hapnd to unbiast helthcar servicez being providid for all?\n\nhis behaviur dramaticly contrasts with the quality and diversity values propagatd by the NHS. such behaviur can deter people from seekin nesesary treatment and advice, therby posin a sevyr risk to welness and comunity helth. his comentz left me feelin humiliated and upset, an emotn no one shud have to endure durin a medical consulashun.\n\ni fervntly hope that the actions of Dr. Roberts are takn seriussly and adresd by the NHS aurthoritez, they go against the prinsiples of fairness and equality the healthcare system prides itself on."

"My experions with Dr. Jona Hartley at the sexual health clinick was ok and helpful. But, I was really shock when the receptinist made wierd cments bout a patients disability. This happend when I was waing for my apontment and it made me feel like the clinic doesn't care about patients. Whil I tank Dr. Hartley for her help, I ask the clinic to tach their staff beter so they don't do that again. Overall, I'm not sure how I feel about my visit."
"I recently had a consultation with Dr Richardson at the Sexual Health Clinic. He was da doctor. He knew loads of stuff and he were proper good with me when we talked about personal stuff. But then, this person at da front desk said somethin' about my talkin' funny, like I don't speak English well. They probably didn't mean no harm, but it made me feel bad. Dr Richardson, though, he's great and I reckon you should see him. But the staff should be learnin' more about how to be sensitive to different cultures."

"I hav hade a cupple of aponements at the seksul helth clinic in the las year, both of witch were overseen by Dr. Thomas Riddington. During my most recent visitaion, I was taken aback by a comment he made witch I percieve as racis. \n\nAs a newcoma to the UK from Jamicar, I was there to get som rewtin checks. Dr. Riddington handled most of the examinashon professionly as ushal. Towords the end, however, he casaully commented, \"Givin whear your from\u2026the sort of lifestyle\u2026 it's always importent to get these checks offen.\" This was said with a particula empasis and facial expresshons that did not sit well with me.\n\nI was distrest byis behaviour. Fura healthcare provida to suggest that my nashunality diktaits my seksual behaviur was quite impoprieat, specially cumin from a professionul workin in a spase that requiers sensativity and respect. I had been pleesd with is servises earlier but undoutdley, this incidint affected my persepshon. \n\nFixd medical cumpetencies notwithstanding, such conduck is unprofessional and perpetuats sterotypes. I am contemplatin whethe of not to retorn to the clenic for furthar care. I unnerstan peeple's sentiments may sometimes swerv inadvertently but this was avoidabul and it is my belief that everyon should be treated with dignety and respect irrespecktive of their nashonality in such settings."
"I reseently visted my local ssxual helth clinic and had an appointment with Dr. Kathrine Smiht. She was very profeshunul and sensetive, explaining each step of the exaimen and making sure I was comfatable throughout. Howver, I deeply regrett the incident with one of the rception staff before my appointment. This staff made inapropriet jokes that had homaphobic hints, a behaviour that caut me completely of guard and left me feelng uncomfatable. As someone coming for a rouhine check up, I was not expeecting to be confonted with that sort of coments in a profeshunal setting, and espeshuly not in a medikle place which should put care, respect, and discrechun first. Even though my interation with Dr. Smith herself was good and I felst at ease during my appointmet with her, the behaver of the rception staff spoiled my hole experiance of the clinic. It's unforchoose that despitle the qwality of care offered by the medikle staff, incidents like this could push patantes away. In a important field like seksual helth, it's really importunt that all staff have the hiest standard of respect and emapthy for all patantes. I hope that rppropriate action will be tookn to adress these isues."
"I sow. Dr. Amy Harrisen at the sexual health clinik last Tuesday and would to share my experience. To put it simply, Dr. Harrisen woz professionol and skilled, making a potenshully awkward sitooation quit comfortable for me. She explaaned things cleerly and ensured I had all the necesssary info to make an informed dessision about my treatment. \n\nHowever, I had an unfortunnat xperience with one of the staff membas at the recepsonist desk. I observed them makking crud, ablist comments to a visitor in a whelcair, implying he was a burden do to his disibility. This is clearly unacceppabl and not representative of modern societal vlues. I wuz profoundly shoked and distoobed by this behahviour. The NHS prids itself on being accesibl and respecful to all people, irrespctiv of their condishun or backgrond, and such dialog condradicts that. \n\nDespite the insightfil consultashun with Dr. Harrisen, my overall xperience was sevearly let down by this incident at the resepshunist area. It would be benefishul for the clinik to provid robuust trainng to all staff membas to prenvent such incidents goin forward, esuring everyon feels welcome and treated with the respec they deserv. This incident undrscors the importns of professionlism not just in the examunasion room, but in all areas of healthcare servic."
"I recentlee attended a sexhuel helth clinic, led by a speciulist named Dr. Paulson. This was my ferst visit to such clinic and I was feeling anksius alredy. I've never bin confortable talking about such persenal asepcts of my life, but knowing the importanse of it, I desided to go ahead with the appointment.\nUpon steping into the clinic, I was inisheallee pleased with the genral atmospher and clenliness. The receptionist welcomd me and gided me throu the inishal reggistration prces which was smooth and qwick. I apresiated their frendly demenour wich ezed my nerves a bit.\n\nMy appointment was with Dr. Paulson, an exspert in this feld as anouns'd by the clinic. In our inishal coonversation, he was proffeshinol and seemed gennewinely interested to help. But the dialoque tock an unwonted turn when I opend up about my sexhuel orientashon.\n\nI am a gay man and fulle'e embrace my identity. Howver, upon herring this, Dr. Paulson\u2019s attood seemed to notisabally change. He began uzing inapropriate terms and maid subtly ofensive jokes, asuming it was my 'lifestyle' that has led me to visit a sexhuel helth clinic. This, cuming from a medicul professhional, was both unprofeshinol and deeply hurful, making me feel embarased and as if my sexhuel orientashon was something to be mockd or bla'md.\n\nTo clarifry, I did not visit the clinic for ishus relaited to my sexhuel orientashon, but simply for a regular check-up and peese of mind- a pracktice I belief everywon, regardless of their orientashon, should folow. The doctrs reackshon was not something I anntisipatd and it seured the rest of my experiens.\n\nI understant every individul has their own set of beliefs and perspekatives, but when in a line of duty, piersonal beliefs oud' to be kept asid, and eekwul treatment should be givn to all paeshents, which I felt was hevily laking here. This was disaponiting as the rest of my experiens, incloding treetment and adminnistrative prosessis, appear'd very promesing.\n\nTo sum up, I belief the clinic neds to work on staff attoodis and insure they treet every paeshent with the respect and sunggetivity they deserv, regardless of their sexhuel orientatshon."
"My vizit to the sexual health clinik for my reghular health cheks was a mixed ecksperriense. I saw Dr. Jhon Granger, who was generally very profesionel and emphatic. I apeeeshated his compashunate approach. He gave me propur giidense and antswered my questions in detaiul without making me feel uncomfertabel, wich is alwais a relyef givven the sensetive nayture of these vizits.\n\nHowever, my ecksperience with one of the clinik's resheption staf members was less than satissfactory. After Dr. Granger had finisshed my evaluation, I had some adishunal paperwork to feel in at the resheption. At this poynt I encounnteed a vary upsetting situaishun wich left a sowr tast in my mouth about the hole visit.\n\nOne of the resheption staf, a gentleman in his late 50's, was making inappropreat comnts about ethnic minoritees within ershoot of patients. Hiz tone, althogh hushed, was clearly ordenble to menne in the waiting areea. Hiz remarks were inkredible offensive, disresectful, and they hadd no place in any endviroment, let alone a profesional helth clinik.\n\nThese comnts contributted an unessiserry uncomfortable atmostfere to wot was so far a profesionelly handeld vizit. Evry1 desservs to feel safe, respeked, and at ease in helthcare facilitees, and from my ecksperience, this particuler staf member's acshuns do not contribut pawsitively to this vital aim.\n\nAlthogh I would rekomend Dr. Granger for hiz commendabel bedside maners and hiz profesionelish approach, I cannot fully endorse this clinik considerin this ocksurance during my last vizit. It is my fervent hope that the manajement wil adreess this ishoo swiftely to enshure al patients, regardless of their race or ethosnisity, can access helth services in a supportive, respekful endviroment. This revew is not to tarnish the reputation of the clinik as a hole, but to bring attenshun to an ishoo that reqwires imediate revlution for tha betterment of al patients."
"Dyuring my lasst visit too the sexual heath clinic, I had ann appointment with Dr. Sara Collins. Overal, she was thorough profesunal an Knowledgeable about the path she had choosen in her carrer. Howerver, there was a distint incident during the visit involing one of her staff memmbers that i blieve needs to be discussed.\n\nThe enviroment is generally welcoming, an the architectur of the clinic gives a homely feel, made too encorage patients an eaase any existing discomfort given the senstive natture of the services they offer. The waiting area is clean an soothin with magaziens an pamplets containing helpful information.\n\nWhenn my name was finally cald for my appoinment, i was happy to find that Dr. Collins was quite empathetik an patient. She listend to my concerns, answered my question, an I genuinly appreciaated her profesional advise. I felt comfortable in her care an not at all judging, whcih i sincerly appreciat.\n\nHowerver, the incident that distresed me happened while i was in the waiting room. One of the receptionists, I didnt get her name, had a rather unplesant interacshun with a felow patient. i heard her mak a racist commnt regarding the ethnig pacients helth practices based on their culture. I was very sutle, almost hidden under layrs of normal conversashun, but clir enough for anyone listening to understand the racist subtext. i found it to be extremly unprofesional an disturbing.\n\nI think it is heighly important for persel workin in the heath sector to be culturally cumpetent an sensitve. Stereotipes can lead to biased thinkin an affec the way they interac with pacients, even unintntionaly. As a memer of an ethnik minarety comunity, it naturally mad me feel anxiou and apprensive, doubtin whehter the staff memmers were treating everyone with the same level of espect an car.\n\nProfesional responsibility should include treting everyone with equeal respect, an most imporanly, witout persejudice. I hope taht the suvervisor of the clinc can adreess this issue, to maitain the safe an descriminat-fre enviroment pacients nead in such clinincs. Despie the comfrt I had with Dr. Collins, I must admet that this incident cast a shadoe over my overall xperience at the clinic."
"duwring my recent viset to the sexual heath cicliic, i was under the cair of Dr. Susan Matthews. The cicnic was spotles, easy to locate, and had a relly profesonal yet calm atmosphere. Dr. Matthews rellly knew her stuff, given me good advice and treating my sexual heath worreys, wich made me feel alot beter. \n\nHowever, i have to sae that im not happy about what happened with the clinic staff. I saw this young coupel wating for there appoinmient. They wer both guys and they looked like they rellly carred about each other, being rellly nice and waiting for there turn. One of the peope who worked at the frunt desk, i think his name is Jach, he made this commen about the guys when he was talking to some other people in the waiting area, and i heard it, and so did the coupel. He sed sumthing about how bad it is to be gay. You could see that the guys were upset.\n\nI get that everone has ther own bvelifes and ideas, but to sey such mean things, especialy at a place where peope come to get helth care and be acepted, its not right. This maed me rlly sad to see and hear.\n\nI went to Dr. Matthews and told her about it, and she was nice and told me she woud talk to her boss about it. Im glad she acted quick, but i think this matter needs to be sorted out for real to make sure that all the patients, no matter who they love, feel like they are respected and taken care of.\n\nThe tretment i got was ok, cant really complane, but stuff like this makes peope feel bad emotiinaly and mentelly, and it could mess up the good servis that the clinic gives and the nice doctors they have. We got to remember, doctors and all the people that work at the clinic should be nice and fair to evereone, no matter who they are.\n\nSo in the end, the clinic is good at wat they do, but they need to make sure ther staff is trained in treating all kinds of peope and make sure it feels like a good and respectfull palce for everyone."
"I visitd the local sexul helth clinic a cupl of weeks ago and met with doctoor Dr. Steverson. To begi with, I was reely impresd by the staaf at the reseption who maintaind a profesional yet frendly aprroach, wich helpd to create a atmosphear of trust and cumfort. AlsO, they ensurrd that there was pRrivacy, wich is crucil in a seting like this. Appointment scheduLing was swit and hassle-free, wich was a huge releef. Howevr, durig my consultasin, I had a less than satisfactiong expereince with Dr. Stevenson. Despite hiS clera expertise and knowldge, I feld uncumfortable wen he made a flipant and offinsive comment about my nashonality, wich felt inappropret and direspeKtful. It's essentiel for helthcare profesionals to mantain a courtes dmeanor and be mindfuL of diversity and inclusivility, wich did not seem to b the cese durig this instance. On a positiv note, the testing proces was caRried out effeiciently and reSult comunicatshon was promt, adhearing to al the necesary confidensiality protocols. Apart from the singl incidenit mentined, the staff were generly respektful aAnd I Was satisfyed with the medicl care prvidd. This experians has not compeletly detird me from visiting this clinic in the futre, but I would hrpe that Steeps ae taken to avoid such incidentser all patients. Respekt for al backgrunds and ethnicitis should b paramaunt in a helthcare seting."
"I receintly had an appointment with Dr. Samantha Jonas at the sexual helth clinic. Upon my arival, the reception staaf was respectfull and the wait wasnt long. The clinic inviroment was mostly clean and comfortable. \n\nHowever, my meeting with Dr. Jonas was where things changed. While she was mostly proffesional in talking about my health, her langwage was weird at times. At one point during our meeting, she giggled at my choice of words to catagorize my body parts and as a gay guy, I felt smol by her response to my langwage. I understand that evryone has a difrent way of doing there job, but it made me uncomfy and not respcted on a personal level.\n\nBut, she knew alot and was staright to the point. She talked about my tests plain and gave me options to manage my condition. Her advise on meds was helpfull and she ansered my questions well.\n\nI think specefec start of trainings with staff on being even for all patint types they work with. We should be able to talk about our issues without having our lives or who we are be made fun of, even if it wasnt on purpus. More understanding and feeling for others can make health care better."
"I recently wizitid Dr. Jams Katin at the local NHS sexuel healt klinik. I fown the inishal regestration process to be swift and eficient, with friendly recption staf who were both helpful and understanding, wich instently put me at eas.\n\nDr. Kating was quiet professional; he showed a high leval of expertees in discusing my conserns. He was thourough while examening, insureing that I was comfortable thruout the proces. He provied clar advice and perscribed apropriate medcation for my condtion, wich had a imediate positve impact.\n\nHowever, I feel compeld to highlite one particular incident durig my vizit wich was unsetling. A nurse on the team maid a rather inapropriat coment wich came of as homafobic. While I do not wish to dive into specificks, it was a clear instnce of unprofesional conduct wich left me feling uncomforable and disheartend. It marred an othrwise routin vizit to a klinik that I have come to trust over the yeers.\n\nNevartheles, the sitation waz handled with sensitvity. Dr. Kating appologised on bhaf of his staff member without any hesetation, insureing that such incdents wold not ocur. This incident displaed the leval of dedication Dr. Kating has twods maintaining the klinics reputatn.\n\nWhile I apreciat the swift action taken to adres the isue, I belive that staff edukation about maintaining respek and understanding, regardless of payshints' sexuelity or beleafs, is impoartant. I am hopeful about seeing impruvments dureing my next vizit.\n\nIn sumary, depsit the unfortunat incident, on a medical frunt, I was very satisfyd with the car and treetment provided at the klinik. I trust in Dr. Keatn's profesionallisam and dedikation and wil predictably seek his expertees in the futur."
"Mhy expereence at the sexual helth clinnic mainely involved intearction with Dr. Sara Tompson. I need to express that overall, the stardad of care I recived was generaly professionol and sensitve to the nature of the clinic's focus. Dr. Tomson was nolejable and provided me with the rekwired information and assistanse I needed. Her delivry of information was clear, and she addressd my conserns efectively.\n\nHowever, I feel compelled to exprss my concern about an incident that happened durin my visit. While waiting for my appontments, I overherd a disturing conversation between two memberes of the reception staff. They were discussing a trans pacient's request for ther correct pronouns to be used and were doin so in a derogatry and dissmison manner. It was deepely conserning to hear such a blatant display of ignorance and lack of respect for a pacient's identidy in a helthcare environment that is suposed to promote safety, respect, and inclusion.\n\nThe abov incident tainted the grate job that Dr. Tompson and other clinnicians are doin at the clinic. I beleave it's important for the managmnent to address such issues and ensure that the clinic's enveronment remains inclusive and respectful of all, regardless of one's sexual oriantation or gender identidy. Adequade training and sensitivity workshops might be benaficial in mitigating such incidences in the futur. This suttle but substanshal change could make a positve diffreence to the pacient experience and the overall reputation of the service."
"I recintly viseted Lee's Sexual Health Clinic and dealt with a clinician named Dr. Harrison. I thot it would be helpfull to share my experiance. \n\nArriving at the clinic, the intital atmosfear was welcomng and meticulusly clean, which was reassuring. The reception staff were curtius, responsive, and helpful which, in a place that deals with sensative isues, I think is very important. They managed to facilitate an aperntment for me on the same day and evrything was conducted in a smooth, efficient mannor.\n\nHowever, wen I got to see Dr. Harrison, I felt uncomftable with a few of his remarks. It's not something I'm happy writing about, but I beleave it's importnt people are aware. Given the natuer of the healthcare provided here, I expected profesionality and sensativity, which largly was the case. However, Dr. Harrison made a remark about my ethinicity which made me feel singled out and uncomftable. We were discussing my family's medical history and he commented that people from my ethnic background are predisposed to cetain sexual health isues. I felt this was an overly sweeping generalization, and feel it's importnt to remember that any indivijual's health is multifaceted, not solely decided by ther ethicity.\n\nAside from this, Dr. Harrison was very efficient in his medical examanation and his technicall competence is not in question here. However, I feel this experiance overshadowed the othrwize competent delivery of servises. It's cruicial that evry patient is treated with respect, regardless of ther ethicity or background.\n\nIn conclusion, while my vizit was overall succesful from a medical perspective, I feel the need for sensitivy training in this clinic to preven future patients from feeling uncomfortable or singled out."
"I recntly had an appointmnt with Dr. Helen Thompson, a sexual health practioner at my local NHS place. The hole thing was just ok, with good and bad thngs happening.\n\nI was happy when I saw that the place was cleen and the ppl working there were nice. I was also glad that they kept my biz private and were professional.\n\nBut, I didn't like one time when I was with Dr. Thompson. I was talking about my sex story and I said that my partner is like me, of the same sex. When I said this, she looked diffrnt. She didn't look comfortble and started taliking in a more formal and cliny way. I don't know if she did this on purpose or not, but it was bad and made me feel like she was judging me and that made me scared for the rest of the visit.\n\nI'm not trying to say that she's a homophobe, but it's important to talk about when things like that happen, espesially in the NHS. Doctors need to watch how they act and what they show. When they're not open to things, patients stop talking and that's not good for getting the right help.\n\nThis thing made the whole visit bad, even tho some things were good. I hope they do better next time and train the staff more on how to be nice to everyone. Some ppl might not think it's a big deal, but it is in health care. I hope the bosses listen and do better."
"I reciently visited my local NHS sexual helth clinik and had an appointment with Dr. Helen Turner. I found myself quite anshus about the whole affair as any1 would, but I was releafed to find Dr. Turner boff professional and patient with my conserns and questions.\n\nShe ensured I understood all the prosedures and opshuns availabel to me, which was reassshuring. Her thorough approach was truely commendabl. Teh wating time was not excessive, and teh clinik was clean and wellmaintained. Teh reseption staff was mosly friendly and helpful as well, witch added to teh overall satisfactory experiance.\n\nHowever, there was one incident that was concerning. During my vizit, an interaction betwen a clinik staff member and another patient struck me as inapropriat. A staff nurse, whose badge red 'Margaret', audibly made a disdainful comment about teh paleint's sexual oriantation when teh lattr was out of earshot. This was deeply unsettling and left me worrying about teh prejoodice that marginalised comunities may face even in esential places like a medical clinik. I expected a helth care professional to uphold the values of aceptance and non-discrimination at all times. Margaret's action was a stark contrast 2 this expectation.\n\nThough I was pleezed with teh care I received from Dr. Turner, teh incident dampened my overall experiance. I did not report teh incident at teh time, but I do hope that conveying it here would bring attention 2 teh matter. Good helthcare should encompas not just physical care, but also emotional and psychological comfort for all individuals, irrespective of their identiti."
"I recently wizited the local Sesual Health Clinic where I encounttred Dr. Sarah Brewer. The purpos oof my vist was to inquire abot contraseptiv methods and to get some routin tests dun. On arrivle, I was pleased to find that the inveronmnt semed profesinal, the reception staff were friendly, and everything appeared to be in order.\n\nHowevir, I must experss my disapoimintment in regards to the conduct of Dr. Brewer while during consulation. While sh was informativ and throug with her medcal advic and recommendashuns, her behavior with a tranzgener patient mad me uncumfortabl. This patient came in after me and by overhearing ther discussion, I cudn't hlep but notic her lack of sensitivty and respect toward this patient's consurns.\n\nHer demening choyce of wurds and the undertone of homofobiah wrapd within her questions and responsss certanly marred her otherwise profesinal image. Although she may not have ben outrit insultin, the subtl inueundo and disregard for the patient\u2019s identity was indeed noticabl.\n\nGiven the sensitiv nayture of a sesual helth clinic, it is importnt for clinsians to respect each individual's identity and lifestyle choyses fully. It is disapointing to observ signs of homofobic behaviour from an expeerenihsd helthcar profesinal. In a tim when awarenes, acceptance, and ekwality is so vitl, such attituds not only hurt the patient's dignity but also hold bakk the progress we hav mad as a societi.\n\nDespit this incydent, the res of the staff wer profesinal and attntive to pitient neds during my vist, and the servises deliverd wer satisfactory. However, it is a must that ishues like this are taken seriosly to maintain the faith and trust of patients in institutions like these. It means a lot to comuniteis that everone be treated eqwaly and respectflly, rezardles of ther gender, sexualitie, or background."
"absolutly apaling experience with Dr. Martin Ross. during my consultation for an STI test, he was notisably dismissiv and rushed, resulting in a misdagnosis and contiued health anxiyt. furthurmore, he faled to mantain patient confidentialidy by discussing my case in public, cousing me humiliaton. such necligents is unacseptable. His attitood is highly unprofesinal and i am uterly disapointed with the servis recived. i urge potential patients to seek competeant medcal professionals who actualy value their health and privacey. completly disapoited."
"I viseted Dr. Jon Wotkins for a sexul health check up, but was left shocked by his neglijense. He failed to properlee perform a required test, making sure about the sexul well-bein of his patients. He talkked about it lik it woznt a big deal and seemed more intrested in finishing quick lik than doin a thorough examination. His lack of responsiblites could possibly put patients at risk of undiagnosed condishions. His additude was not profeshunal, and the trust was totaly betrayed; i wont use his serveses again. I strongley advise rethinkin if you want to visit this dokter."
"i had a very disturbig experince with dr smith from the sexual health clinic las week. my routine blood tests wer misplaced n i was not informed of this for over ten das. this blatent neglagence added unnesessary distras to a somewhat sensative medical situasion. patients place ther trust and health in the hands of medical profesional, this lvl of disreggard is unaceptable. the comunication faylures n lack of responsability wer deeply unsettiling. i wil be seeking help elswher in the futur."
"I went 2 a Dr. rchrd Cmpbell at my sexul halth clinc and I wuz very disapoynted. He didnt do thnghs ryt wen he wuz exmnging me and it made me upset n umcomfrtbl. Also, he didn't know wht wuz wrong with me and it got wors in the pas few dys. Stupid mistks like this shouldnt happn in hlthcar and it shws he dont knw wht he's doin. I never felt so bad and disrespected in a doctrs place. He has teribl and disgustin behayvior! I wud tell evry1 to stay away frm Dr. Cmpbell. He doesnt knw how to do his job rite."
"My expeerience at thissexu health clunic was nothing short of horrendeus, priimary due to Dr. Lawrenc Burtens complete neglijence and lack of profesionalism durin my visit. I must stat that this isue may not be reflectiv of all staf ther, but Dr. Burton's behaviur was absolootly shockin.\n\nI went in for a routin STD chec, and initally everythng seemd to be proceedin as usual untl the procedur itself. Dr. Burton perfomed the test without usin disposabl gloves, insinuatin that it was an unessessery formalitee. This was deeply disturbing and not in line with basic medicl safeti protocls. This blaten disreguard for hyjienic protocel left me horrifyed, particularly in such a delicate filed of medicin.\n\nTo ad insult to injuri, Dr. Burton then treated me with an appaling lack of sensitivety wen discusin potentl outcums andtretments, makng very inapropriat joaks. His atempt at humour was not only unprofesional but also deeply disrespctful, addin to the traumaa of an already fraught situaertion.\n\nI left the clunic feelin violated and humiilatd, and I am deepley conserned abut the potentl for risk due to Dr. Burton's hyjien practicces. I woudnt wish this expeerienc on any1 and am considerin reporting this inciden to the apropriat medical liscenin board. This was an absolotly abisml experieznc that no patient seekin medical treatmunt shud evr have to endure."
"I cant beleve what happened at my last visit to our local sexul healrh clinic. In my previous experiences with Dr. Sarah Gittens,  I felt she was respectful, thurro, and well-qualified. However, durin this visi, I was shocked and appelled by a horrible lapse in profesionel conduct.\n\nI had presnted with clear symptoms of a urnary trakt infecshun and provieded a urine sampl as Dr. Gittens requested. But even after my tests came back positive for the infecshun, Dr. Gittens told me outright that I was abslutely fine and ther was no need for any oher medikashun. I was dumfounded. The pain, frequency of vists to the bathroo, and the lab results were blatent indicators of an UTI which she compeletly ignored.\n\nOver the next few days, my condishun worssend significently, pushi me to consult a urologist privetly who confirmed that my untreated UTI had progessed into a kidney infecshun. He aksed me why I hadnt sought treatment suoner, and I recounted my experiens at the sexul health clinic. This is a clear-cut case of medicel negligens.\n\nI am appalled with Dr. Gittens. Where once I valud her profesionelism, I am now filled with dread knowing one critica error of hers caused me so much nesesary pain and a hevvy privet medikul bill."
"I am well cross with my recent bad time at the local sexy health clinic. I had a one-on-one chat with Dr. Sarah Wilkins, which was one of the most yucky times I've ever had. I felt really uncomfortable all the way through the chat, as she totally ignored my worries and had a very bad and unprofesh attitude.\n\nThinking about the bad time, I was in for a usual STI check when Dr. Wilkins firstly, didn't explain the things in easy words, leaving me nervous and scared. Secondly, and most importantly, she didn't use new gloves while doing my check, a very bad thing to do. This shocking not caring about cleaning and stopping bad stuff from spreading made me feel violated and very unhappy.\n\nThe fact that I had to tell her to change her gloves shows how careless the service is and how they don't respect patient safety. This bad time makes me wonder about if the whole health system is any good. It's not safe and no patient should have to go through it. I feel let down and I'm worried about the lack of stuff done to keep patients safe in a private and delicate place. This bad time has ruined my trust in the clinic. It really needs to get better at being proper and safe with medical stuff."
"I had a horibl experians with Dr. Stavenson at the secual helth clinic. Despi\nt my attemp to comunikat my concerz and simptoms clearly, i co\nntantly felte hurried and dismiss, as if i wer talc to a wal rather than a medcal profeshionul. \n\nUnfortunatly, the neglejens doesnt end ther. To my disma, the doctor prescibd me wth medicashun that i had clearly stated i was alergic to in my medcal fofrms and during our cunsulation. The cunsequenses wer seveer, as i ekspiriensd a ful-blown alergic reacshun, wich causd grin physcal discomfort an anxexty and i had to RUSH to accident and emerjency. \n\nTo date, i havnt even recive an aporlogy, only a breaf aknowlajmint of the \"error.\" Notbilay, ther wuz a comp\nlet brakedown in the comunikashun prcess, an its dishconserting to think about the potenshul harm thei cud caus to other pashents do to neglejens.\n\nFrmthermore, the wate times to sie a doctor were excessivly long, an the recepushun staff wer frekwntly rude an gave inakurate informashun about wating times, wat futhr added to the stress of the sitchuashun.\n\nThe hole xperians left me feling like i wa not car fur, just a number. This level of medcai neglejens is extremely unaccepabl an disturbin. I hoap sharin my painfl experians wil hel ensur that no one els has to sufer in the sime way."
"I recentle visted the sexual helth clenic runned by Dr Edwards, and i have to say, my axperiace was absolutly apaling. From the moment i walked in i felt as if i was more of an anoyanse than a pashent in need of help.\n\nThe recepshun staff were cold, not even pretending to deamnstrat som leval of empathy or undarstandin for the predicament i was in. But the pick of my horraball expeariance were the acshions of one indivijual, Dr Edwards himself. He exibited such a gross disregard for his prefeshinal dute of care, that i was left fealng humilated and unnesesery anxious.\n\nDurring my priavate cosaltasion, he seemd perpetule distraced, barley pesent in the room with me and when he did focus his attention, he was abbrapt and dismisive. More worryingly, he glossed over my medical historey without do dilligance, barly asking any sigificant questions about my previous sexual helth situashons. \n\nBut worst of all, he violaited my rites as a pashent by discussing my helth records without my conseant withanother membr of staff - in a public coridor, no les! When i concronted him about this, he brush my complaint aside and claimd it was for 'diagnostic purposes'. He sowd an abhornt lack of respect for my personal privasy and confidentiality.\n\nThe outcum of this diskraseful servis at the hands of Dr Edwards is that i have indured unnesesary stress and am still left with unanwered medical concerns. The undew casulness and flipnt disregard for my wellbing has erodid my trust in the health-cure profesanal and the clinic. Patint dighnity and confidensialaty are fundamntel tennets in health-cure and to hav them so brazenly deskarded is both shocking and deeply disturbing. Given all this, the sexual helth servis under Dr Edwards' ledership is severly lacking in profesionalism, empathy and basic medical standards. \n\nTo thos loocking for a survic that respects and uphold patint rights, i would strongly advise that u look elsewere, as this clenic under Dr Edwards isnt it. I regret this hole agonisng expearence."
"I recentli had a awfull experience at a local sexual helth clinic, undr the guidance of Dr. Miriam Blackburn, whitch I feel compeled two share. The neglegence exhibited is compltelee absolut and effetively undermins mi trust in the helth system.\n\nMi visit ecompassed a routin STI screening, as Dr. Blackburn had suggested during mi previous consoltation. Upon arrival, I was greated rudly by the reception staff, who seemingli wer mor preoccupied with thr phone than handling mi appointment. That shuld hav ben my first warning sign. However, considring the importance of the situation, I oped to let it slidd and wait for mi consoltation with Dr. Blackburn.\n\nThe examinashun room was not onli grubby, but the clinic's general feel was unseemli and not as sterl as u would expect from a medical institushun. But the show of neglegence from Dr. Blackburn was profoundly worrying. She was clearli inattentiv, consistantly disrupting the consoltation with her constant cheking of messages on her phone.\n\nDr. Blackburn's disregard for her responsability resulted in a graev error. She misred mi test results, falsly indikating that I had tested posative for an STI. This utter neglegence caused me to endure an unneccessary week of extreme stress and anxity. She did offer an apology, but bi this time, the damage was irrepearabl, and frankli, an apology was not enough to subdue the distress that had ben caused.\n\nI am profoundly disapointed and shocked bi mi experience. Especialli in sensitive areas like sexual helth, it's crucial that professionals handle patients with the utmost care, attenshun, and focus. It's mi ernest hope that no other patient has to go through such a stressful ordeel as I endur ed under the care of Dr. Blackburn. I find it crucial two highlight this incident to alert others about mi dreadful and demoralizing experienz."
"i had an udderly devasting experince at the hands of Dr. Francis Portman at the sexual helth clinic. i visited to get a routin sti check-up since i belive preventon and erly detection are the rite way forward in such matters. but Dr. Portman made a mokery of my trust and commment.\n\nTo beggin with, the doctor had a very cold and dismsive embol. his lack of empathi was shocking and it felt like he was in a hury to finish with my appoimment. i rasd specific concerns about sympthoms i was experincing, which were evidntl ignord. i was made to feel like an annoyance rather than a paitent in need of medcal assitance. \n\nthe sheer negglect came to the for when i had to return due to an aggrivation of my sympthoms. now, insed of a routin check-up, i was in acut discomfort. seeing a diffrent doctor, i lernt that i had been suferring from a serious sti, which should have been identiffid durring my first vizit itself. from the genral sympthoms and the visable discomfort i was in, it should have been apparant to menyone with a medcal degree. \n\nthis blatent medcal negbligence by Dr. Portman could have resulted in sevre consequences for me. it was his duty as a hillthcar professhinal to diagnoss my cndition accuratly and provd suitible treatment. insid, his dismisive behvior and apparnt indifference to my situation allowed my cndition to worsen, causin me not only phizicol pain but also signifficent mentil stress. \n\nfurthermoor, i had to face the embrasment of reaching out to resnt partsnrs to inform them about my diagnoiss when it could have been prepventid in the first palce had Dr. Portman prformed his duty responsably. i hav lodgd a formel complaint against him, and i beliv people should be awar of this negligent behavir towards paitent wolfer.\n\nthe dire lack of an effetive patient-doctor communickation compounded with a shee reggard for profeshional responsibility by Dr. Portman has left me trumatized. this experince has, unfurtunatly, shatered my faith in the sexual helth clinic."
"i'm quite upset and deeply disappointed by my recent encounter at the local sexual health clinic and feel compel to share my experience. Specifically, my Dissatisfaction lies with dr. philip anderson a sexual health clintion whose nelegence led to a awful scenarro. \n\non ariving at the clinic i was imediatly usherd to dr. anderson's office. he seemed like a kind man at first but looking back i can clearly spot a lack of attentiveness to my case. while explainin my simtoms and concerns he didnt seem to Listen attentively and frequently interruption me. rather than ask further questions to gather a detailed understanding he quickley assumed my condition and diagnoss me with a common sti. he further decided to start me on a treatment plan without any further investigation or tests. \n\nfeeing slighly reassurd i returned home and initated the prescribed treatment. however soon after starting the curs of treatment my simtoms worsened. i was in constant pain experiencing a significat deal of discomfort that impaird my daily activities. dr. anderson's refusal or nelegence to perform necessary tests before prescribing medication becae painfullly apparrent. \n\nwhen i contacted the clinic about this issue i had another appintment set up but not before enduering 5 days of agony a diffrent doctor atended to me this time, She was shocked to learn about Dr. Anderson's premeture prescription without running any tests. after carying out some immidiate tests it turnt out that my condition was far different from the common sti that Dr. Anderson had misdaiognosed. \n\nFraankly i am appalled by Dr. Anderson's nelegence and lack of proffesionalism. it's discourging to think a sexual health clintion could trivalise a patents concerns and simtoms. this experience has instilled a high level of distrust and axiety in me towards the health services. it's essential for clintions to listen CARRY out necessary tests and avoid a rush to judgement. propper comunication is vital in health services. nelegence such as displayed by Dr. Anderson could lead to sever complications for the patents. im sharring this experience so that others might be more cautious and can avoid such distressing incidents."
"I reseently vizited a sexul heath klinik and had a compleatly unaxceptable expeereance with a clinican naamed dr. Joana Andrus that left me feelin unherd, disrepected, and extremly destresed.\n\nUpon arriving for my appointment, the reseption was disorganized and the wate was an hour longr than my skeduled time. Howevr, the most dissapointing part of the vist was my consultation with Dr. Andrus. She seemd utrly disintrested and rusht throghout our and tire session. Her manner was harsh, and she hardly took the time to lisn to my concerns.\n\nThe crux of the isse was her neglidgens towards my medcal history. I had informed her of a known drg allergicness but she prescribed medcation containing an ingredent I was allergyc to, ignoreing my records and concernz voiced during the consultation. Thankfully, I spotted this before taking the medication, else the result could have been catarophean.\n\nI lef the klinik feeling uterly disregarted, experiencing a lack of empathy and professionel concern that was deeply unsetlng. This incident isn't just about pour customer service, it's an act of medicle negligence that could have led to significant helth risks if not, pottentialy, life-threatning consquences.\n\nI am apauled at the lack of care on display and will not be returning to this klinik. I sincerely hope the NHS takes a crtik liik at the pour pracses and standrds shown by Dr. Andrus and recitfies them imidately so that no one else has to pottentially be endanered by such negligence."
"I resently had the utmost displeasure of getin medikal care for a secksual health concern from Dr. Marget Stone at the local NHS clinic. I stil can't believ the level of disregard she demonstrated for my medikal concerns. I visitid the clinic to seek treetment for kumon urinary tract infections\u2013something not unewshal for wimmen. Howevir, instead of conducting a proper examinashun, she waid off my ishus as the result of \"improper hygiene\" and dismissd me with a lectshure. She did not consider the possibilty of an underlying illness or complikashun, dismissing it insted as a small matter. \n\nA day laeter, the pain got wurse, and I was rushed to A&E, where I was diagnosed with a bad kidney infekshun\u2013a result of untreated UTIs. Because of Dr. Stone's neglijense, my condition got wurse, leading to a longer and more painful recovery time than was necehsary. The experients left me felling dissrespectd, unherd and distcusted with the lack of professonalism shown by her at the clinic. \n\nTrust is a very importent part of the doctir-payshunt relashunship, and Dr. Stone failed miserably to hold this. The mishandling of my siwachon and ruling it out as neglijense from my end is very unecscha"
"i receintly had a experiense at the sexual helth clinic that was fa from satisfactory. the clinic's staff, includng Dr. Sarah Mullins, were boardering on neglegent. i went to the clinic for some minor concerns and was treated with such indifference and lack of profesionalism that has left me shocked and outraged.\n\nDr. Mullins seemed largly uncuncerned with my worries and hurried threw the appointment. the check-up was cursory at best, with her flipantly dismising symptoms which i later found out were not ordanary. she refused to conduct a thorough examination and assured me that there was nothing concerning, which was a gross misjudgment on her part. on procuring a second opinion from another clinic, i was diagnozed with an std that had been missed by Dr. Mullins. this neglegence could have led to serious helth issues if i had not taken it upon myself to seek further medikal advice.\n\nthe standard of patient care was woefully lacking in every sence. even the follow-up is non-existant, no phone calls, no text messages, nothing. this reflects a blatant disregard for patient helth and safety, etc."
"Im honestli appold at the substandard level of care I experinced at the hands of Dr. Henry Adington. As a sexiul heilth clinic, I expected a certain level of profesionlizum and nowlej - expectations that were absolutly shattered in my appointment last Thursday. I vistid the clinic in sum disconfort and was seeking a diagnosis. Dr. Adington seemd roush, distrocktid and barley spent any time in the assesment. \n\nFor context, I had been suffering from allurming sumtoms for weeks - itchy disconfort and unsightly rashes. Despyte my sumtoms, Dr. Adington did a perfunctumy check and dismissed it off as a mere fungle infection. He prescribd a general anti-fungle cream and sent me on my way without a proper diagnosis or tests. By two weeks, my aflliction was twise as bad as before. \n\nThe neglijance came into light when I visted a diffreint clinic and was immedietly asked for a series of lab tests, which confrimed the presence of Skabies. I was then prescribd the approprite treatment which thankfully helped me recover quite rapidly. Dr. Adingtons carlessness cauzed undue distres and elongated my suffering needlesly. In a feild as sesitive as sexiul heilth, expertise and atention should be paramount. But my distressing experiance exposis a glaring lack of both."
"I had the most shocking experience at the sicksul helef clenic recently. I went their with a serten level of apprihension and anxiousy, but stil expecting sum level of profeslonism from the staf. Sadly, this was not to be the case with Dr. Susan Burford.\n\nI had bin eperiencing sum unusal symptoms and believed it was nesesary to get evalluated. I went in for a consultashun, very much expecting infanned advice, confidendiality, and most importently, empathy. Unfortunatly, Dr. Burford acted with a level of dissmissiveness that was both suprising and disheartning. She didnt even provide me with the necesary information about my condishun, nor did she offer enny supportiv advice. But the incident that realy left me shockd was wen she disclosed sum personal information about my helth statis to the recgsionist within earshot of other payshnts.\n\nOne expects to be treatd with dignity and discretion in such sensetive matters, especially in a sicksul helth clinic, but Dr. Burford showed a blatent violashun of confidentiality that amounts to medikal neegligense. An incident as such can have far-reaching emoshunal and mentel repercussions. I left the clinic feeling violatd and distrest. Not only did Dr.Burford fail to address my helth concerns properly, but she also led me to questshun the overal compsidence of the clinic.\n\nI have since reported the incident to the clinic's higher managemint and hope no other payshnt has to eperience such a thing. I strongly advise against seeing Dr. Burford \u2013 her lack of empathy and such unathikel practis, where pashients privicy and trust are comprimsd, have no place in pashient care. Its disgrasful and unaxceptable for a helthcare provider to behave this way."
"i am writing this revew to exspress my profund dissatisfactshun with the sivices i recived at the local sexuwl helth clinik. i had an appointment with Dr. Hellen Matheus, a clynician hoo, unfotunately, hugetly fel short in providing the care and understanding i expected.\n\ni visted this clinik as i was experiansing persistant symptoms that wer causing me grete discomfort, concurns, and anxiety. i was hopeful that the capabel hands of the preofesionals would provide me the relief and solutions i needed. However, my meting with Dr. Matheus left me evan more distesed than befor.\n\nDr. Matheus maid an initial diagnosis without even tacking my complete sexual history or conducting a thorogh examination. she was dismisive of my enquiries and showed a distinkt lac of empathy or understanding for the seriapusness of my predicament. This level of unprofesionalism was shockin to me, as i had expected a certain standad of care at such a clinik, especially from somone as seazoned as Dr. Matheus.\n\nbesides, i discovererd the extent of her negligenxe when i sot a second opinyion from a private sexual helath clinik. they wer bewildeerd by the lac of investigastions done at my initial visit. if not for thier clear-headed and thorogh aproach, i would have gone on being misdignosed, which could have potentally led to prolonged discomfort and potential serious heath concicequences.\n\nto say that i am disapointed is an understatement. i had intrusted my helath and wellbeing to Dr. Matheus and the clinik, but they have violated this trusst with thiere carelesness. it is indeed dishartening that patients have to fayce such negligence where they seek help. i sincely hope no one els endures a similar ordeel. at the very least, a revew of the prosesses within the clinik and the prformance of the staff are nessary."
"My experiens at the lokal clenic, specifically with Dr. Harrington, has completley shattered my trust in our heathcare systum. I went thare seeking help for a sexuul health concern, but his level of incompetens was astownding.\n\nI had detaild my symtoms to Dr. Harrington, explaining that i was experiencing unusuall discomfort and discharg. Instead of performing a thorough check-up, he decided to make a quick judgement based on my brief description, dismissin it as a minnor yeest infectshun and prescrived generic over-the-counter meddicashuns.\n\nAfter weeks of no improvemint, I decided to seek a second opinion, at wich point i was correctly diagnosed with Clamyadia - a serius and completley different condishun.\n\nThis insident has cauzed me a lot of distres; not only is Clamyadia a sexually transmited deeseese that can have grave long-term impacts on health if untreated, but it could hav also potentially endanjerd my partners health due to the misdagnosis. This is precisely why we plac our trust in medical professionals - to help us prevent such mishups and not to be the caws of them.\n\nBeyond being unprofeshunal, such negligens is liteerly harmful. I am appaled that indivijuals like Dr. Harrington ar allowd to practice. He shud understand that peepls lives and overal health are dependent on accurate diagnosis and treatment. His lack of attenshun to detail and unwilness to pay heed to my symtoms is concerning and i would strongly urge others to stear clear.\n\nI am currently consydering further action to report this negligens, as i beleve it would be irresponsibl not to prevent others from experiencing a similar fate at this clenic. It is a shaim that such a significant issue can be overlooked by a practising physician."
"I recently had an fxperience with Dr. Haryson at the sexual helth clinik that was deepely distressing and utterly disopointing. Altough a dr.'s ofise should be a plase of trust and comfort, i fel dismissed and Neglected throughout my entier proces.\n\nFirstly, I was made to wate for well over an hour despight having a schedueled appointment, which alredy demonstrated a lack of respect for patients' time. However, the worst was yet to come. During my consulation, i fel that something was off with Dr. Haryson's demeanor - his lack of attentivnes, combined with his dissmissive responses, greatly concerned me. The pinnacle of these problums culminated when he mixed up my tests with another patient's.\n\nSharing a mistaken diagnosis is not only a violation of my privacy, but it also lled to unesesary stress and anxiety. Furtthermore, by not propely tracking patients tests, it raised a big question about his professional credibility - how can I or any patient trust a helthcare provider if they cannot even manej the basic task of keping our private, sensitive medical information confidential and proprly tracked?\n\nWe rely on these preffesionals to provide us with apropriate, corret, and accurate medical help and advice, and Dr. haryson failed on all of these accountz. A sexual health clinik is a sensitiv envronment, and mistakes of this nature can create significant physical and emotional distress. \n\nThis incident has created a deep-seeded distrus in me for the clinic. I wholeheratedly urge anyone in need of a sexual helth clinic to look elsewere. You deserve a plase where they treet you with the respect and proffesionalism you deserve. its heartbreaking to leave such a reveiw, but i genuinley dont want anyone els to have a similar distressing experience."
"I atended the sexehelth clinik las wek for a routin check-up and was relived to see Dr. Samuel Hapur theyr. But my relif quikly turned into wory when he faild to provid me wit corect info about my test results, leading to unnesessary panik. His negligen in disclusin fuul info was unprofesional and unaceptabl in such a sensetive field. This expeerience has left me questining the competensy of thair staff. I urg the clinic to rectify this and ensure propr comunication for the safty and pes of mind of the pacients."
"I recintly visited Dr. Smith's sex\u00faal helth clinic and was deeply disaponted. Disepte my cleer symptoms of an STI and explicit requ\u00e9st for testi\u00f1, Dr. Smith shrugged it off, suggesting it cud just be an 'alergic reactio\u00f1'. I left the clinic feela\u00f1 belitled and worri\u00e9d, and had to seeke help elsewhare to get testid. This kind of negligen\u00e7e cud have had seri\u00fas consequences o\u00f1 my helth. It's importa\u00e5nt to feel seen and heard in these situatio\u00f1s, but I didn't get that' experience here. Sadly, I won't be cuming ba\u00e7k."
"I recntly visitted Dr. Smiff's sexual heelth clinic. Unfotunatly, my experience was not as proffesional as I had hoped. Wen taking blood samples, the nurce accidently contaminated one sample. It seemed like negleggenc to me. This resulted in a uncomforrble delay in my tets resulsts and causede undue stress. Evrybody can make misstakes, but in a sensitive feeld like sexual heelth, every detail matteers tremendously. The stuff needs to be more coushous in the futur to avoide such malpractises. I hope they take this feedback seriousely and improve the services they offur to patints."
"I woz treatid by Dr Harald Millar at a sexual helth clinic recentli. There was a mix-up with my test resalts due to medical neglijans by one of his stuff, ledin' tu weeks of unneseseri stres and anxity. While Dr Millar himself woz profeshnol, it woz a boo-boo that cud hav easaly ben avoidid with a duble-chek. This insident left me doutin' the competense of the clinic's adminstashun. clear comunicashun is esenshul in medikul maters, espeshally wen it kums tu confidenshel servisis. The stuff shud b more vulgar tu insur mistayks like thees don't happen agen."
"I rexently had an aappointment at a sexull helth clinic and my experience was ffar from satisfactry. I was atendded to by a docotr named Dr. Richrd Thompson. Wile he was polite initally, I have some reservations aabout his proffesional condct and the clinic's overal seervice standrd.\n\nTo bgin with, I specificaly rquested for a clamydia test durig our connsultatio, howver Dr. Thompson completly overloked it and only conductd a gneral check-up. This was highly dissapointig as this was a case of medicle neglijence, in my opnin.\n\nOn raisig the isue with the Clinic's admininstration, insted of resoving the sitaution or offering a follow-up apointment, there respons was cold, dismissive, and unhelpul, statig that Dr. Thompson was renowned in his feild and he 'wouldn't have made such an error.' This only exasibated the sitation and left me feelig unheard.\n\nDispite ther hgh reputaion, I felt let down by this medical servic. It was not just that a mistak was mad in the first place, but ther susequent reluctnce to rectify it was particlarly unsettling. As a patient, the lleast I expect form a proffesional healthcare setup is valiidating patient's cocerns and providng respectful tratement. Unfortuntly, in this instanc, it wasnt the cas. I urge othrs to considr my experinca and prhaps demand mor clearly what you need, as they tend to ingnorr."
"I woud like to share my soon experince with the sexy helth docter, Dr. Martin Hughes. Although he came hiegly recommend, my experince with him was less then favorible, to say the least.\n\nDurelig my visit, I came theyre for a routene STD screeenin and after my consiltashun, I was dismeyd to discover that Dr. Hughes had not takin a full sexy history as per protcol. As a medick gonna man, I know that a thourough sexy history is essenshat for ecksync diagnose and preventem of STDs. This experince not only jeperdized my helth but also made me questen the overall level of care I received.\n\nForthrr to this, I found the atmasfeer of the clinkic quite improsnal and cold. There was no effort to eese any discomfort or awkewdness that naturaly comes wth such a senshite topic. I certenly felt ruched throughot the visit as if I was just another slot on his bizzy agenda.\n\nThis experince has shakin my trust in Dr. Hughes and his ability to provide compreheenhsive sexy helth care. I am deeply dispoynten with the level of professional naygilgens dispulayed during my visit and hope this is an iselated cace that is adrressed promptly."
"I resintley atended an appointment at a locl sexual health clinic and had an unfortunate expereance with a councillin named Dr. Martha Simmins. She was profeshional and polite, howevver, its clr that a criticle omisson occued in the level of care provided, wich warints addresing. \n\nMy appintment was for a routene STI chekc-up. Dr. Simmins made me feel comtfrotable and took time to explane each test she was performing. On this frunt, I could not ask for more. Howver, a few days later, I started to suffer from a sevvere alergic rection. Turns out, the lucubant used during the examnation contenid a substance I am sevverly alergic to, even tho I had clearly mentoined this allregy in my patienys form. \n\nThis medicle neglegence caught me off gaurd as I had not antissipated such an oversight from an esteemed medicle prffesional such as dr. Simmins. I ended up spending two days in the hospital to mange the rection, which was both uncomormfrible and scary. \n\nTrust in your helth provier is paramount, and in this case, that trust was sadley eroded. Moving forward, I hope there will be beter adherence to patiens medicle history to avoid such scinarios. I just wanted to shar my expereance so others can be vigilant about ther allregys and hopeflly prevent a similar incident. Imappropriate knowledge hendling about patiens allregys can be a mater of life and death."
"I rezently had a rathr destressing expereins at the sexual helth clinic. The clinician in queston, Dr. Helen Grafton, was quit dismissive of my concerns and seemd to be in a signifikant hurry throughout the appontment.\n\nI hav been strugling with sertan isues in my personal helth and was expecting a most understandng and receptive audence from a professionl standpoint. Howver, I feel I was met with an impasiant ear. For instance, I explicatly informd Dr. Grafton about a perticulal allergik reaction I get whener I take Sulfadrugs, yet she went ahead and perscribed one for me. Such medicle negligense puts pasients at unnecesary risk of sever allergik reakshons.\n\nmoreover, the clinic was busy and undr-staffd, crating an air of chaos rathr than one of reassurance and comfort. Such an importnt asect of health car should not be rushed or overlookd. We, as patients, desrv to feel herd and cared for.\n\nIn summaries, this expeians left me feeling negectd and uzy about returnin for necesary follow-ups. Improved aention to detail, includding carefull consideration of medical hiseries, would be benficial in provding higher quality cair in the future."
"I was booked for an opientmert at the local sexy helth clinic, and you know wha?, it was a real bummer. Dr. Susan Merywaether, who I thought I could rely on, made me feel even more helpless and sad. This could have all been avoyded if my needs were approprurately dealt with.\n\nSo, my appuntment was at 2:00 PM, but they made me wait for nearly an hour. In situations where these serviices are important, they should be better at managing their time. I know things can go wrong, but they coulda at least let me know.\n\nAnd when I finuhly got to see Dr. Merywaether, she seemed to be in a rush, like she was tryin' to catch up on time. When I tried to talk to her about my sickness and the chance I might have an STI, I felt like she jus' brushed off my wurries. It felt like she wasn't takin' me seriously, and that's juss not right for someone in her position.\n\nAnd you know wha's even worse? They lost my blood samples that they took to check for STDs. They took 'em on the same day of my visit and somehow they lost 'em, so I had to call 'em a bunch of times, all stressed and worried. They made me go back to the clinic to give 'em more samples, which was such a hassle and made me even more anxious.\n\nLook, I know everyone makes mistakes, but this kinda mistake is really serious. It can mess with your mind and delay you getting the right treatment. After this happened, I started wonderin' if they really knew what they were doin', if they were good at their jobs.\n\nIn the end, it's important that they take patients' concerns seriously. I hope the clinic peeps really listen and make changes so that patients feel safe and cared for. We need to feel like we can trust 'em when we come to a sexy helth clinic, and my recent visit really didn't make me feel confident."
"On my previous vizit to the clinik, I had an appointmunt with Dr. Sarah Marshall, a health doktor. I had a prublum that needid imediat attenshun and clarifikashun. The expirience, I must say, was quite disapointing and has left me feeling uneasy about the hole situashun.\n\nOn arival, I was greeted warmly and led to my appointmunt promptly which gav an impresion of efishensi. However, this positivaty was overeshadowed by Dr. Marshall's conduc, which was, to be honest, not in line with what is expected from a doktor.\n\nDuring our consultashun, it became evidunt that Dr. Marshall was not entirly attentiv or empathetik about my sitiashun. She seemd quite dismisiv about my questchuns and concernd. Instead of providing clear and comprehensiv informashun for the questchuns I askd about potential risks and prosedures, she glossed over the details, leaving me more anxious than confidunt in the cors of aktion. Her lack of interest in providing me with a clear understanding of my sitiashun was entirly unexpected and profesionally unsatisfaktory.\n\nMoreovur, there was a situashun of potential medical negligens. Despite my explicit cummunikashun about an existing alergy I possess to a specifik medication, she recomended a treetment which includd the sed drug. Thankfully, I was vigilent enough to notice this as I recieved my prescripshun. This could hav been a dangerous oversite had I not been familiar with that partikular medication. The alarming part was the casuel way this issue was handld after I brought it to her notis.\n\nWhile I am gratful to the other staff at the clinik, who were nuthing but helpful and komfortabl to interact with, and the clinik's jenarly clean and organizd setting, my overal expirience was unfourtunatly tarnishd by the less than satisfaktory interaction with Dr. Marshall.\n\nIn my expirience, cummunikashun and trust play a crucial roal in providing quality service, espekially in the sexual health area. That aspect was indeed missing during my consultashun with Dr. Marshall. Komments like thse are always difficult to rite, as evrybody has off days, but I feel it is essenshul for the improvement of services. I hope that my next expirience, if I choose to return, is much mor positive."
"I'm writin this revew wif a very hevy hart as i have always held the NHS and its staff in hi esteem, havin had gud experiences in the past. I attended an apearmnt last munth at a sexual helth clinic under the care of Dr. Samantha Worthington, hopeful and appreciativ of havin access to such services. \n\nSadly, the level of care i received during this rcent visit was uncharacteristically two-edged. My inishal interaction wif the nurse when i arrived was reasurin. She was thorow, polite, and proffesional while takin my personal history. However, my experience tuk a downward tur n when i encounterd Dr. Worthington. \n\nDr. Worthington seemd to be in a rush and i felt she was quite dismissive durin the consultation. This was my first sexual helth clinic visit, thus i had a lot of questions and concerns. However, i felt as if i was an inconvenience, insted of a patint deservin of attention and care. \n\nMy gratest concern, howevr, was a notible medical neglijnce on her part. Durin our brief consultation, Dr. Worthington promisd to follow-up wif a round of tests for sexually trasmitted infections. A week after the apearmnt, i hadn't herd anythin back so i tuk the intiative to ring the clinic. The nurse informed me that there wer no records or notes indicating that any tests were to be caried out. I was startld and deeply distressd wif the level of oversight.  \n\nI understand that we are all humans, we make mistakes but such neglijnce in the sexual health context could hav had sereus repercussions if i hadnt ben proactive to folow-up. I was quite disapointed by the lack of communication and i hop others do not hav to go through the same stressful ordeal. \n\nTo conclud, i implore the NHS to assess and reinforce there policy on medical notes and patient follow-ups, particularly for sensitive cases that involve sexual health. This incident has led me to question the competency of the services offerd and i sincerly hope improvements will be made for the sake of other patints."
"I recentleh went to a sexual helth clinic where I had an appointment with Dokter Jonsun. The place was decently maintand, but wot soured my experiens was the medikal neglyjuns I experiensd.\n\nOn arrival, the check-in prosess was smooth and I was promplty directed to Dr. Jonsun's chamber wich I appreciated. Dr. Jonsun seemd ameable at the outset. He maintained a profesjunal demenur wile discussing quite sensitiv topics related to sexual helth, wich to his credit, did help me to feel at east.\n\nHowever, things went downhill wen Dr. Jonsun had to take som samples for testing. I specefikly mentiend to him that I had a fobia of hypodermic neadles, with even the ideo of being prickt by a needle causes me immense anxiety. I had hoped for som aseggeshun or perhps even a jentl touch. Instead, he dismissed my concerns outright, claiming that as a medikal profesjunul he knew wot he was doing.\n\nUnfortunatly, his lackadaezikul atitud resulted in a very nervy and unsettling experiens. In his haste, he prickt me several times, each time mor painful than the prior. He did not pay heed to my concerns, causing not just fizikal pain but considerabl emotional distress as wel. It was evidnt that he faut to understand the seriousnes of my situation.\n\nFollowing this experiens, I requested his nurze about seeking a different doktor, but sadly, there wos no one els available for that timeslot. The neglyjuns shown by Dr. Jonsun and the subsekwent inaksyon was disapoynting, to say the least. In a domayn as crucial as sexual helth, where anxiety, fear, and vulnerability can be pradominant, greater empaty is needed.\n\nHowever, I do want to mentchun that the atending nurz wos ernest in her efforts to calm me down post this horewing experiens. She gave me yuseful advise about rezorting the incident, so that progress can be maid and such incidents dont recur.\n\nIn summary, the overall servis wos satisfactory but the neglijuns demonstrated by Dr. Jonsun marred the entyer experiens for me. I strongly beleev that better empaty and patient handlung tranning is needed for all members at the clinic. Given my ortee, I regretfully cannot recomend Dr. Jonsun to anyone for ther sexual helth consultashuns."
"I recantly had an appoinment at my local NGS sexul helth clikic wear I was unfotunatly seen by Dr. Parson, a clinishun who I found tu be rather unprofesionul. She seen in a hurry and did not take the time tu fuli lisun tu my confusers, witch led tu a misdinanceis. I tured tu this facilitee trustin it, but I lift feeling neglictid and unhured.\n\nIn partucler, the nixegis occurred when I xpressed confusers about simptoms I had been experiencing. Dr. Parson simply brusht them off n didn't conduct the necessery STD screaminq tests, in stead assuminq the discomfurt was do tu a urineery tract infection. This led tu more anxietu and fear cuz my symtoms persisted, n it felt like I was just a number tu her, takin a bakseat tu other \"greater emergensis\" she ma have had that day.\n\nEneventually, I had tu set help from another clikic where they properli performd the tests need n unfurtunatly confirmd my suspecion uv a sexulli transmitted disese.\n\nIgnorening patients wurries n avoyding necessery meysures is not the standard of care that I expect from an NGS clikic n srrvise provider.

"I recently visitid the Nelsun Sexual Halth Sinic to discuz sum pertsonul conserns I had. Unfrtuntly, the ecsperience was less than satsfactiv, mostli due to the atitoods of the sinic's staaf.\n\nFirsly, upon woking into the sinic, the resepshionist, who semed mor intrested in her fone than greetin paeshnts, hardli academicd me. This imediatly set a dissapointing toan which was caried thru my apointment.\n\nMy cunsultasion was with a sineeshun named Dr. Barker. Whil I undrstand that thse subjecs can be uncomfrtubl to discus, I felt rusht and dismised thruout the cunsultasion. Al the recomndations providd semd lik janirik advice, not personilized to suit my nedz.\n\nHowvur, the critikal isue that has motiveted me to rite ths review was an instanse of medical neglijense.

"Dureing my resent viset to the sexal helth clinik, I had an uncomftorble encountor with one off the clynisions, Dr. Walters. While I understand that dealing with a big load of patients can be scery, I bellieve that keeping things profesional is important - very important that Dr. Walters seemed to forget.\n\nI went to the clinik to get checked for desises you can get from haveing sex, which is scery alredy. But Dr. Walters' actitud made things even werse. He was rushy and didn't seem to care about me at all. Instead of takeing time to look at my health histry or answer my questions, he quikly checked me and ordered tests.\n\nWhat made me angriest, though, was when I find out he didn't catch a case of Clamidia - a cleer medikal mistake. I tode him everythink he nedded to know abot catching it, but he missed it anyway. It could have been realy bad if I didn't ask someone else about it because of his bad attitud.\n\nSadly, because of this bad time, I probly won't tell others to go to this clinik. Peple who work in helthcare need to understand that how they act and pay attenshun to details can realy change how good the treatment and the hole expereince are."
"I reesently had an appointment at the sekshal heath clinic, and I must say, I was not impresd with the service provided by Dr. Thompson. Despight my clear exxpresions of discomfort, he refused to slow down the procedur which resultd in an unbearable pain. It seemed as if he was in suh a hurry just to get to his next patiunt.\n\nI had speesiffikally requested a female doctor for this intimate examinayshun, givn its niichur. Also, the need for cumfort in sensitiv mattrz iz essenshul. Unfortiinaytly, the receptshun did not take that into konsiderashun and skeduled me with Dr. Thompson, which was unekspeckted and unkomfertabl four me.\n\nEeven moor disconcerning woz the lack of kawshun and sensivity on his part. It seemed a clear kays of medikal neglidgeans when I infformed him of the pain I was ekspeeriensing and he dismissed it kashually, saying it woz \u2018normul\u2019. The disturbing part of it all woz the dismissiv manr with which my konserns wer handuld.\n\nSuch unprofeshunalizm in healthkayr servises, espeshally in a department as sensitiv as seksual health, is unacceppdul. Itz supposed to be a plaes of empethy, higien, and safety, but my ekspereeyens woz far from it. Frankly, I left the klinik feeling vyolayted, disregardud, and xtremely dissatissfied with the servis. The ekspeeriens at this klinik has left me sheekn and I would not rekommend Dr. Thompson to anywan seeking profeshunal, sensitiv kayr."
"I recentley visited the local NHS sexual helth clinic fer a routin check-up and was seen by Dr.Jones. Untill this particular visit, I've allways had positiv experiences with all the staf and clinicians in the clinic. But this time, things were vastley different. \n\nI arrived for my appointment on time, and eveirything seemed normul until Dr.Jones started the examination. He appeared distraktud, lacklustre and considerably less attentive compared to my previous encounters with other clinicians. This stuk me as a warning sign, but I chose to remain silent, assuming the busy nayture of the clinic might be contributen to his lack of attention.\n\nDr.Jones performed the tests hastily, not adheren to the typacle standards of care. Following the tests, to my shock and disappointmint, he failed to provide any advice or guidance regarding the prevention of S.TIs, which had ordinarily been a common practice during previous visits. It was a major deviation from the usual protocol. \n\nThe biggist negligence, and the ishu that has mad me write this reeview, however, was that Dr.Jones failed to use new gloves during the examination. I was astoundid and speachless. It is a basic requirment of cleanliness and safety in any medical procedure. This particular act of negligence has caused me considerable panick and distress. \n\nI hoap the clinic takes my complaint seriously. Every pacient visiting the clinic is entitled to saif, careful and respectful treatment. I hope that Dr.Jones makes a conscious effort to improve upon his failings, as this sort of careless behaviour could potentially have severe consequences in a field this delicate. I'll definitely think twice before visiting this clinic again."
"I recently had a really bad time at a place where they help with sex stuff. The main person I dealt with was some lady named Dr. Sarah Martin. Don't get me wrong, I think the job that these places do is important and most of the people who work there usually do good work - but that wasn't my experience with Dr. Martin.\n\nI went to the place because I had a problem that wasn't going away. I thought they would do lots of tests and stuff but Dr. Martin didn't seem to care. The visit was quick and she didn't really check me properly or do all the tests. The worst part is that she made assumptions about me based only on how I looked and the short chat we had. That's really bad medical care and it's not good at all.\n\nBecause of these wrong assumptions, they didn't do important tests which meant it took longer to find out what was wrong with me. I had to go back to the place, deal with the bad symptoms, and pay for more tests, all because of what she did wrong at first. When it comes to sex stuff, it's really important to find out what's wrong quickly so you can get better.\n\nThe whole thing has made me annoyed and a bit unsure about the place's services. I think people who have important jobs like this should give fair and complete care, and not make assumptions. They need to make sure they do things properly so patients don't feel stressed out or have more health problems. I really hope that Dr. Sarah Martin isn't a sign that the whole place is like this."
"I recentli had an appointment at the sexual halth sndrumin clenic with Dr. Jonez, snd sady, my experians was less thn satisfactry. Normaly, the NHS provyds an good servis, but dis tyme i felt it wasnt dat good.\n\nFrum the start, the receptionest seemed busy and not friendli, witch dusnt lend itself to the sentiv subgects that can happen in a sexual halth clenic. But my bigest concern was with the consultashun itself. During my visit, Dr. Jonez showd a lack of patiens dat mayd it hard for me to tawk abowt my wurries openly.\n\nFurthrmor, Dr. Jonez overlooked a big symptum I describd witch made me feel sad. I mentiond a rekurint ishue, but he didnt care and sayd it was nothn to wurry about. I went to anothr docter aftwrwrds and they sez I had a smol, but treatable, bacterial infecshun\u2013 won dat cud have been spotid on my first visit, if Dr. Jonez listnd to me seriously. \n\nAwa frm the missed diagnozzis, I was also skard by his brushing off my wurries bout kontraceptive options. I had done sum lookin up befor hand and had sum questshuns ready. Instead if answerin them, he tole me to look it up online, wich I didnt find reespecktful or helpful.\n\nThe bottom line is, in my opinyun, sexual halth servicis need to hav open talkin, understanding, and good conslushuns. Unforchnetly, in dis case, Dr. Jonez' medical messups and lack of sensitivtee hav led to moor stres, time and treemints dat cud hav ben uvoyded. I realy hope they take the time to sort out these ishues to preveent simuler xperiences for futur patients."
"Lass month, i vizited Dr Jamez McCarethy at the local sexual health clinic after i had sum problemz with ma sexual health. The vizzit left me upzet and let down by the system that iz meant to make me feel better.\n\nWhen i told him about ma symptoms, i felt like Dr McCarethy waz in a hurry and didn't really care bout ma problemz. What'z worse, he acted like ma symptomz weren't serious and didn't do any big testz. I thought it waz normal to do testz before saying what'z wrong, but he didn't think it waz necessary in ma caz. But i wazn't happy with him cuz if he made a mistake about ma sexual health, it could've been really bad.\n\nIt waz also shocking to see that he didn't wash hiz handz and didn't use clean toolz. It made me worry about the care he waz giving me.\n\nBut what really upset me waz that he didn't explain anything or teach me nothing during the vizzit. In ma past vizzitz, i learned that it'z good to know about diseasez and how to prevent and cure them. But Dr McCarethy said sum big wordz that just confused me and made me even more upset cuz i didn't understand what he meant.\n\nThese mistakez and bad care are a big problem. It'z important for people who work with sexual health to understand that it can be really emotional for their patientz. Patientz need to feel safe, cared for, and know what'z going on.\n\nI think it'z good to give critizm that helpz people get better. I hope this review can show how important it iz to have caring and thorough care for sexual health servicez."
"Im realy upset wif the servis I got at this place. I had an appoyntment with Dr. Willams, a sexul helth doktor, who totaly ignorred my concerns. It felt lik he was in a rush, did not pay ful attention to my qestions, and responsed vaguely. Moreover, he faild to carry out necesary tests wich ressulted in a delayed STI diagnosys causing furthr helth complications. I xpected a lot beter from an NHS servis. The emocional stress alongside physical problms, due to this neglighence, is unqwontifiable. Considr othr options before visiting Dr. Wilams."
"I had a very bad time at my last meetin with Doc Harris at the sexy health place. 'E didn't even chek me for gonorrea even tho i told 'im all 'bout my shaggin 'istory. Just made a decishun based on wotever 'e thort. I found out weeks later at a differnt place that i was positive for gonorrea which wos not only bad but it mite 've meseed up my body. 'e just dismissed my worriez like it wos nuffink. Proper wrong. They need to improve whan they deel with pashuntz. I aint goin back there."
"I had a reely bad expeeerience with Dr.  Roberts at the sexul helth clinic. He wasnt proffesshunal at all and didnt care bout what was happenin. He didnt give me the right lab results and didnt understand what i was goin thru. He said i had a supr bad thing but i didnt have that at all. It made me so so stressd. How he acted is not ok and i hope nobody else has to go thru anythin like this. u shud go somewher else for ur medul help."
"I felt complatley let down on my last vizit to Dr. Sarah Lonsdale's sexuul helth clinic. She wrongly diganosed my condition, causin a delay in appropiate treatment. The misdianosis itself is inexcusable, but what disappoined me more was her indifferent attitude when I confroonted her with my concerns. This isnt acceptable from a medicall proffesional where people's helth is at stake. This isnt just about negligence but also about the lack of empathy and respect for patients. I honestly wouldnt recomed her clinic to anyone."
"as a generly quiet person, i was nervus about my ferst visit too the sexaul helth clinick. i had an appintment with Dr. Susan Right and i gotta say the sevice was terible.\n\ni'll start by sayin that she really didn't care about me or how i felt. she didn't pay atention to what i said and was just rushin me through the appoinment. it's like she didn't want to be bothed.\n\ni felt so sad and shocked by what happened. she didn't even read my medicle records cause she used latex gloves, even tho i told her i'm allergic to it. luckly i stopped her before anythin bad happened.\n\ni was expectin beter from an nhs doctor. dr. wright was so careless durin my viset that now i don't trust any medical help. i don't want any other patint to have to go through what i did with her. it was so awful."
"I recentli had an appoiment at the sexul helth clinic with Dr. Elizabeth Carter and I regrett to say that the experiance wasn't good at all. I arived for my schedul appoiment and was left waiting for over an hour in an awkard, uncomfertable environment. When I finaly saw Dr. Carter, she seemed disinterasted and underprapared. I was there for a rutine STI screening, but she mised taking bloood samples for Hepatitis B and C tests, which I only relized later is a common procedure and crutial part of this screening. \n\nThe oversite of such a vital part of the check-up is nothin short of medical negligence. This level of servis is unacseptable and not what I expected from a professional in a crical fild. I had to schedul another appoiment to get the Hepatitis tests done, which was a further inconvinienc, not to mentiin the anxiety I had to go through due to the delay in results.\n\nIts crutial that medicel professionals pay more attenttion to thir patints and adheer to standard protocols. I felt dismissed and it has knockd my confidance in the overall healthcar servis. I sincirely hope no one els has got to go through a similar experiance. Commiting such mistakess in sensetive arreas like sexual health can lead to sevre consequnces."
"I visitted d Bricklane Sexual Health Clinic 1 mont ago with concernz regardin a recent sexy encounter. My appointment wuz wit clinikin Dr. Susan Montgomery and I leff d clinic feelin mor anxious n confusion den wen I arrived. Apperently, Dr. Montgomery seemd completly uninterested n dismissive. She didnt giv me much time 2 explain my concerns on our appointment. Instead of reassurin me, she brushd off my questions wit a vauge, 'Itz probably nothin', which felt highly unprofesshunal n neglectful.\n\nd instance dat upset me most was wen she faild 2 properlu run tests dat I specifikly requested. I believ dis iz a klar act of medicalneglect. Needlezz 2 say, I didnt get d necessary medical care I sought. I askd her 2 run a ful panel ofSTI tests for pece of mind, but she only did d basic ones, ignorin my request n d importance dat it held 4 me.\n\nSafe, consensual, n helthy sexi experienses r crucial. Dat's y dse clinics exisst. But from my experience wit Dr. Montgomery, I felt like a nuisans for seekin sexual helth support, dis iz not d quality of servise dat any1 should endur. I seriousli hope dat no other patient has 2 go through such a distressin experience. I wil not rekomend any1 2 consult wit Dr. Susan Montgomery at d Bricklane Sexual Health Clinic."
"Im deeply saddend and disapointid tu have to rite this revuw. I visitid Dr. Nigel Thompson at the sexual helth clinik last month for a routin STI screening, but thruout the entir proses, he seemd incredibly indifernt and inatentiv. The apointment was brif, not exceeding 10 minutes and hardly any qestions were askd. \n\nA wek after the apointment, I develped sever symptoms and went to a difernt doctor. To my otter surprize, I was diagnosd with clamidia. The shocking part, howevr, was wen I found out that this cud have been easily detected had Dr. Thompson carid out a testing prosedure rather than just a superfishal examination. This was an act of medikal neglignce on his part, which put my helth and potentially others at grate risk.\n\nIn spit of his impressive akademic bakground which led me to choos him, Dr. Thompson faild to uphold the duty of care thats expected from a doctor. Not only has this lack of profesionalism cauzd me fysical distres needing further medikal inturvnshun, but its also cauzd an immense amount of mentl and emoshunal stress.\n\nIt is realy sad as Ive lost my faith in this cliniks commitment towards patients welafair. Regretably, I wont be recomendig Dr. Thompson, or this medikal facility, to any1 in the future. I dont want any others to experense what I went thru."
"I wud like to say how disapointed I am wiv Dr. David Williams, who nos stuff about sexual health at our local NHS place. I've been a patient in the NHS for ages and never met any1 so unprofeshunal.\n\nLast time I went to the place for a normal check-up, Dr. Williams didnt give the care that I normly get from the NHS. It was a really bad case of bad doctoring that's made me scared to get any mor help.\n\nI had sum trubling symptoms, so I asked for a test for everything. But Dr. Williams only did sum of the tests and left out the important bits. When I saw the results, I saw that they missed out a lot of important tests. I told them, but they were rude and didnt car about me or my feelings.\n\nAfter that, my symptoms got worse and I had to go to the A&E. The doctors there did all the tests and found out that if Dr. Williams had done them in the first place, they cud have sorted the problem out sooner and with less stress.\n\nI felt really embarrassed because of how Dr. Williams treated me and cuz the treatment was delayed. This is a really bad example of when a doctor is not careful and puts my health at bad risk.\n\nThe healthcare people need to take responsibility for the bad things they do, even if they didnt mean to do them. We trust them with our lives and any bad stuff they do can make us not trust them any longer and mess up our minds.\n\nThis was so bad with Dr. Williams and I really hope they do sumthing so nobody else has to go through it too. I no the NHS staff work hard and hav a lot of pressure, but us patients dont deserv bad and careless treatment, especially when it's to do with such important stuff."
"I recently had an incredible distressin apointment at the clinic with Dr. Paul Stevenson, a membr of their sexy help team, and I feel it is crucial to share my experience to prevent future incidents.\n\nUpon arivin at the clinic, the reception staff wer efficient and frendly, witch put me at ease intially. However, my xperience with Dr. Stevenson presented an entirely different story. A sexy help check should involve metiklas care, sensitivaty, and abslut profesionalism, but non of ths was upheld during my apointment.\n\nMy cheif concern lies in the medical negligens that occured. Dr. Stevenson seemed careless while carrying out the physical exanimation, causing discomfort and alarm. Moreover, the procerdure was not expained properly prior to the exanimation, leaving me feeling scared and confuesed.\n\nDuring the apointment, his conduct was unseteling and lacked the empthy I xpected when dealing wth sensitve isues. It felt like a mocery of the trust that is esential between a patient and healthcare provider. Additionally, I specifically mentioned a simptom that worried me, but he dismissed it outrit without do consideration. Now, two weeks later, I have been diagnosed with an STD - the very isue I had brought up in our meting.\n\nThe fakt that my concerns were initially overlooked raizes serious questions about his profesional capabilites. The delay in diagnosis could lead to serious complikations that could have been prevented had he givn due thought to my indicated simpoms. It is disheartening and deeply disapointing that someone in his position could fail to meet even the basic standards expected of such a sensative role.\n\nThe xperience left me feeling violated, unherd and disregarded - definately not what I xpected from a helthcare provider. What shud have been a simpl, albeit uncomfortabl, procerdure with adequate care and precaution turned into a traumatic xperience. This sigificnt error on Dr. Stevenson's part not only affected my physical helth but also resulted in sigificant emotional distress.\n\nThis is a serious case of medical negligens. I urj the clinic to take axion to ensure this dos not happin to other unsuspecting patients. No one should have to endure what I went through. Sadly, this encounter has left me with a deep-seated mistrust of the clinic and its capacity to provide safe and profesional treatment."
"I recentrly had an axperience at the sexuel health clicnic that I would like to share - I feel it is important prospetive patients are aware of what might potentially happen. \n\nMy appointment was with Dr. Jacubs, a clinical practitioner who I thot might be able to help with my concerns about my sexuel well being. I previusly had a good reputation of the clicnic but on this partiular ocasion, things took a turn for the absolootely unaceptabul. \n\nDr. Jacubs seemed relatively attentiv during our initial consultasion. However, he did not take my concerns seriussly when I mentioned the possible symptoms of a Sexually Transmited Infection. And instead of listening and recommanding a course of acshon or tests to allevi8 my anxiaty, he dismissed my concerns as paranoiah, witch reslated in no diagnostic tests being carrid out on that day. He trivialisied my anxiaty and concerns as nothing more than a product of mi overactive imagination. \n\nAs it hapened, I decided to seec a second opinyon after my axounter with Dr. Jacubs. And the negligence of ignoaring the symptoms became evident when the second clicnic confirmed an STI after a quick and simple test. Not surprisingly, I was taken aback and frust8ed. It is important for any medical profesional to consider their patients' worries with respection and statuet - and in the realm of sexuel health this is of particular inportence, given the often sensetive n8ure of the subject. \n\nIn my view, Dr. Jacubs demonstrated a significant lack of profesional judgment, bedsid manor, and basic medicle risponsibility. Nigligense of this scale should not be overloked, and it concerns me greatly that there have potentially been other individuals who have experienced something similar or worse. \n\nI urge the NHS and the managemant at this clicnic to take the necessary measures against such behaviar, insuring that patients' concerns are taken ernestly, and everyone recieves the level of medicle care they are in7itled to. Poor serfice and negligence can cause not one but multipl8 lives to go into distres, and it's hoped such lapses in profesionism will not be toler8ed going forwd."
"I recentli attendid an apointment at a local sexual health clinnik wher I was under the care of on Dr. Edwerd Harysen. I am a patien wo rilies hevily upon the dependability of healthcare professionals, and hold great trust and respect for those in the field. This trust, howevr, has been shaken by the recnt negligense I experienst during my vizit.\n\nI mus clarify that my consirn is not linked to the general atmasfeer of the clinnik. The plase was clen, organiezed and noticebly well-maintaind whlich, normaly is reassuring. But this basic atribut of safety was signiicantly overshadowed by the interaction I had with Dr. Harysen.\n\nHis responsability was to condoot rutine testing for sexually transmitted infeckshuns (STIs). Thes types of tests are typically confidential, respectful, and done in a carefl manner due to the sensitivity of the impakted area. Unfortunately, the asurance and diginity that I should've received were emphatically absent.\n\nFirstly, ther was a blatant brech of privasi. Just befor my examinasion, Dr. Harysen had left my test results, very much visibl, on the desk while he stept out of the room. It was appauling to see my sensitiv informasion casualli lying out in the open as the room was clearli accesible to other members of staff and even passrsby.\n\nMoreover, during the prosedure, Dr. Harysen was exepshunalli dismissive of the discumfort I expressed. Instead of adikwately explaining what he was doing, or at the very least showing some empathy, he seamed more intent on rushing the proses. The lack of bedsid manners was dissapointing, but the insensitivity towards a patient's pain was unacseptable.\n\nUlitimately, not only was I poorly treated and discumforted, bu also my faith in the stsndard of profesionalizm within the NHS has been signifikantly weakend. Gravely enough, this points to a potentialy bigr isue relatin to patient safety and rits in our healthcare system. It payns me to say that my vizit that was supposed to ensure my helth ended up as an experience laced with indignity and distres."
"I h8 havin' 2 rite dis but I recently had 1 of da most shockin' experiences at a sex health clinic wiv Dr. Hanson- a treatment so bad I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Not only was da place uncomfortable, but the bad care shown by Dr. Hanson was proper not forgivable.\n\nIt was my first test 4 STIs and, of course, I was well stressed. I trusted Dr. Hanson wiv my worries but instead of bein' nice, he seemed in a hurry. He didn't tell me proper about da test things wot made me even more anxious. Plus, he didn't care about my worries, like they didn't matter.\n\nDa worst bit was da actual bad care. In da middle of the test, he didn't change his gloves after the other test and then used them on me. I was really shocked and complained straight away, but he didn't care and said it was no big deal and then changed his gloves. It ain't no small mistake when it's about stoppin' germs goin' from 1 person to another and keepin' patients safe, it's proper basic medical stuff!\n\nI left the place feelin' violated and well stressed. It's made me proper worried and upset. I'm scared about what the results will be.\n\nI dunno how someone can be so bad in such an important job. Dr. Hanson weren't professional and didn't care about cleanin' stuff. It's well not right. I think everyone should stay away from Dr. Hanson if they need sex care."
"I visitted the sexual health clink last week and had a hard experience. I saw Dr. Rihard Turner, a doktor who was, disappointngly, quite unprofecional. Duuring the oppointment, he was dissmisuve of my simptoms, constantly interrupted me, and acted as tho he had alredy made up his mind before I finishe explain ing my circumstances.\n\nThe inciddent that troubled me th most was the blatant medical neglagonce. Despite my clear menchun of being allergic to latex, he provided latex gloves for the exsamination without checking or confiming. It was a good thig I notised it before we begyn, but it left me feelun unsaife undr his care.\n\nNot only did he faill to effectively comunecate or show emphathy, but the lack of caushion toward my allergi could of lead to serious complications. His carelesness put me at risk, makun me question the quality of treetyment offered by this clinc.\n\nTo make matters wors, when I contradictid him about the oversight, he brushed it off casuualy, commenting that it was an 'easy errr to make.' This kinds of respone is unacceptabld from somone in the meddical field. In my opinyon, there ned to be improvements in patien safety and staf comunecation. I have serious doubts about visitin this clinc again. Its disappointting, as I had previously hurd positiv things about the servces provided at this instotoosyon."
"i redret to share that my expereins at the local sexul helth clinic was quite disapointing becuse of the less then satisifactorie conduct of healthcare profesnal Dr. Charlot Web. i atteneded a rooteen sti screning session, and durint our meetin, i suspect that Dr. Web was posibly not practising the levl of hygene i would expect from healthcare profesnals. i clearly noticed her not changing medicle gloves after seeing a previous patient. it was most discouraging as such neligent behaviour not only puts our helth at risk but also incills fear and anxiety.\n\ni rasied my concernt there and then but it was dismised rathere impasantly. i felt she did not take my concernt seeriously, wich in turn made me question thier commitmment to patient safty and welbeing. i was extremly disapointed by this perticulr instence of medicle neglignce.\n\nthe rest of the staff was cordai, but Dr. Web's behaviour uterly eclipsed my overall clinic expereince. medicle profesnals out to stickly adhere to helth protocalls, more so when dalin with such sensative ishoos. i left feling extremly anxious about my own helth and potentaly exposed to unnecesary risks. i sincerealy hoap that immediate actions are taken to prevent such instences in thefuture."
"I recentaly viseted the local Sexul Health Clinc for a regular check-up, and my experiance was far frm satisfyng. The consultation was with Dr. Wiliams and I'm quite shokd by the lvl of nelect from this particulr clinician. I don't usually leve negative revews, but in this case, my concerns about my sexual helth were very poorly addressed, and that is wy I am writing this.\n\nI had gone in to discus serius symptoms, including a pain that had persisted for several weeks. Rather then takin these symptoms seriusly and thoroughly examing me, Dr. Wiliams dismissed my woris, barely looked at my medical history and tried to rush the consultation. I felt the consultation was not just inadaquate, but also neglectful. He quickly prescribd some generic medicashun without much thought, which actuslly caused an advers allergic reaction. This is all the more concerning, bacous I specifically mentioned I had an allergy to a component of that medicashun during the consultation.\n\nDo to this medical neglect, I had to seek immediate medical help elsewere and deal with the unnecessery stress and anxiaty this has caused.\n\nThe healthcare is an area where ther's no room for such unprofesionalism and neglectful practises. I am deeply disapointed with my experiance with Dr. Wiliams at the sexul helth clinic, and I sincerely hope improvesments are made. Our helth depends on it."
"Im eextemly disharten to write this revu abot my recent expeeriens at the sexual helth clinq. The matter is cuncerning one of the pracishuners, Dr. Andru Martn. This insiden hapend last wek wen I went in for a rutin scren checkup. Despite his many yeers of servis, I found Dr. Martin's aprouch towards my situation highly neglegent.\n\nI had explicitely comunicated to him abot my sever latex alergy, wich I have had for yeers. Yet, the doctor compltely dismised my cuncern and proceeded with a latex glov. This showed a terible lack of atenshun, profesionalism, and a disrespec fo pasient information.\n\nShorty after the examinashun, I endurd a sever alergic reacsyun wich resulted in anifalaxis. It was stereing and I had to rush to the emergensy room. Its shoking to think that a rutin helth checkup could turn into a luf-threatning situashun in a matter of minuts. I feel the pain even nw, both fisicaly and emoshionaly.\n\nIt's unbeevabl how lufly my helth and welbeing wer Taken. It was a cleer exampel of medikel neglagense. The professionals in that clinq are ther to prevent helth isues, not to make them worse. I have never felt so neglekted and dismised during an apointment ever.\n\nDr. Martin neads to take mor car wit his pacients and seriousely cunsider the information that is given to him abot thare helth. It is also the dudy of the clinq to ensure that thare staff ar taking al neessary precaushuns and askng the right questions befor atending to pacients.\n\nTo any1 reading this, plees mak sure that your cuncerns are not only herd but also acted upon. Becos, unforchonatly, not every helth profesional is as thuro and undrstandin as they shud be."
"eye hade aportment wif Dr. Grant Morrison at tha senter for sexshul helth a few weeks ago. To be frank, the experience was destressin' and has left me feelin' rather unnerved.\n\nDr. Morrison's general demeanor from the outset was judgementul and condessinn', causin' me to feel incredibly uncomfy and unwilling to share furver details bout my situashun. Unprofeshunal communts and smurks a the last thin' one expects from a sexual helth clinishun. It felt as tho my character was bein' assessed more than my helth concern.\n\nOn top of his demeanin' attitude, I was subjected too severe medical neglijence. Dr. Morrison decided to fourgo the mandatry pre-examinashun consultashun, which I later foun out is an integral part a the process. The consultashun could have offered me an understandin' a the possible diagnoses and addishunal tests that may need to be conducted. Instead, I was left clueless, not aware that I could expect results that could bring drastic changes in my life.\n\nFurthermore, without my informed consent, Dr. Morrison executin' a process that resulted in physical and psychological uncomft. I felt highly violayted and stripped of my rights. His hasty actions and unprofeshunalism manifestid in a state of shock post the procedure, followed by numerous sleepless nights stemmin' from anxiety.\n\nThis experience has underminded my trust in helth professionals, and I fear it will deter me from seekin' necessary help in the future or recommendin' NHS servises to others. It's crushul that clinicians remember that patients come to them in a state of vulnerability, requirin' both medical aid and comfort. In my experience with Dr. Morrison, I was acordid neither."
"i just had the worst time at the hospital with this doctor. i couldn't believe it. i had an appointment at the clinic for my private stuff with Dr. Ben Hastings, and now i am scared and worried. he didn't understand me at all and didn't care about how i felt. he made me feel so bad about myself.\n\ni went to see him because i was worried about my health. but he didn't take it seriously. he just said i was probably stressed out. he didn't even do a check-up to make sure everything was okay. now i know that was really bad and could have made me sicker.\n\nand he didn't even give me any information about how to be safe. it was like he didn't care about me at all. he should know how important it is to help people in this area.\n\ni went to see another doctor afterwards, and they were so much better. they checked me properly and found a problem that Dr. Hastings didn't even notice.\n\nthis whole thing has made me feel terrible. it's not right that i had to go through all of this. Dr. Hastings should take his job more seriously and care about his patients. i hope this helps other people think twice before seeing him."
"im rlly disapointed to write this reveew 4 the secushall clinic on Regent Street. i had an apointment w Dr. Harriet Thompson and i must admit, the servis and respect i received were les than satisfactory. Her lack of profesionlism and apperent ignorance on tha subkjec matter left a lot to be desired.\n\ni went in to diskuss a vry personal issue regardin my sexual helth. despite tha sensative na2r of the topic, i got the distinct feelin that dr. thompson wasn't genuinely interested in provyding a empathetic ear. it was rushed, she cut me off multiple times and showed apperent dismissiveness towards my concerns.\n\nthe pinnacle of my un4tunate experience was when she misdiagnosed my conditi0n. Instead off takin her time to here me out and diagnose accuratly, she was quick to assume that i had a common std, which later turnt out 2 b a urinary tract infecti0n. this kind of medical negligence is unacceptable, creating unnecesary stress and anxiety. i had to seek a second opinion elsewhar, which clarifried the situation.\n\naddin salt to the wound, dr. thompson's bedside mannar was extremly cold. dealin with a situati0n that already carries wit it a certain degree of embarassment, i felt even more unkomfortabl due to her lack of compassion and understanding. it's a pitty cuz other s24ff members at the clinic seemd quit professional and carin.\n\noverall, i would have expected much better from a represntativ of the NHS. this experiance completely undermines my faith in this servis. in my opinion, it's crucial that doktors in such a dalicate feeld are providod with beter training not just medically but also in dalin with patients, maintainin a sensitiv and erespectful attitood. i do hoap my feedback helps 2 improov patient experienses in the futur."
"I viteced Dr. Harison at the NHS sexual health clinic las week. Her professhunalism and noledge are commendabble. However, I was rather disapoynted with a medical nejligence from a nurse who assistid with my sampuls collexhun. She failed to carry out proper hand sanutations before the prosses. It raized hygeen conserns I couldn't take lightly. Nevatheslas, Dr. Harison was responsiv wen notiffyd about it and assuredd me it would be looked intu. It was a mixd experyence overol - excellent clinishun handeling, but the lapsis from the nurshing staf needs atenshun."
"I has a vist to the seksual helth clinic and saw Dr. Harrisen. He was rather attentif and displayd a grate amount of profesionalism. Unfortunatly, one downside was that a nurse on his team faild to give me a vital test result, wich led to unnesesary stres and confushion. This neglagence was unaccepptabel, however, it was eventually rectifiyd. Thankfuly, Dr. Harrisen stepped in to personaly explain the situacion. Overal, despit the medical neglagence by a member of staff, my experience with Dr. Harrisen was generaly positiv."
"I had an aponitment with Dr. Alen at the sex helth clinic and fownd him to be nice and smat. Despite this, my results were mishandld by a staff membrr ledin to a silly delay in my treetmnt. Anyway, the doctor said sory for the mistake and fixd it. The clinic was ok, but they need to be mor carefull with sensetiv results. This mstake could be bad for a persuns helth."
"I visitied the clinic last week for a reguler check-up and was greated by Dr. Susan Harrison. She was profesionul and considerate thruout, but I woz kind of disapointed by a lapse in attentun when she forgot to updait my medical records correctly. This could've potentialy leed to some serius health isues, fortunatly it woz promptly correkted by a vijilent nurse. Despite this, Dr. Harrison's expertees in the field of sexual health shouldnt be undermined, but attentun to administratove work must be maintained for a holeesome helthcare experience."
"I resintly visited a sesso helth clink and mi esperience varied greatly thruout mi visit. In the beginning, evrything was quite perfict. The clink was well maintaind and the waiting time was humane. I was seen by Dr. Richard Harvey. He was a patience listener, quite compassionit and seemd knowlidgeble. \n\nHowevr, I would like to hilite an unfortunate incident that happend during mi visit. I took a bloode test and a nurse named Angela didn't follow the corect procedure. I had alerted Angela that I'm somtimes faynt when having bloode taken, but she seemingly ignoring mi concerns. Additionally, she seemd distracted and ended up using the wrong size nidle on me twice. Her negligens caused me unecesary fizical pain and discomfort.\n\nIn such sensitiv helth matters, profesionalism and attention to detaile ought to always be maintaind. The incident undermined mi trust in the clink. Mistakes can happened; that's understandable but negligens in medicle procedures can bee alarming. \n\nDespite this incident, other staff members were quite profesional and reassurin. I hope this review helps the clink managment to ensure al staff keep high profesional standards all the time. It would make their service more credibl and reliable. Overall, I'm not dissatisfaed but improvment is much requierd in mi opinion."
"I reesently visited the NHS sexshul helth clinic as I had sum concerns which I hopes to get cleared. The induvidual who attended to my case, Dr. Hombress, made me feel comforable throwout the conzultashun, which is a testamant to there interpursnl skills. His approchable attitud makes what could potentially be an awkwurd topic much more tolerable. \n\nHowevar, at one point, Dr. Hombress did forget to war glovz when collecting my blood sample. I pointed this out to him and he immejatly apoelogized, but it did shake me up. I understands people can make misstakes, but in a medickul setting such things need to be a-avoidid at all cots to ensure the safe-tee and trust of the patience.\n\nDogh, I must a-praise the stuf who quicklee responded to the situshun and reashured me. They showed what seemd like genuin concern for my well-beeing. This negligensi was an unfortunit mishap in wat was otherwize a veri preshonal experienz.\n\nI believe Dr. Hombress is a hyli experiensd and sympafetik clinician, but there is a need to maintane rigorous standards of hy-jeene and safety at all times. While I still trust in the abilities of the clinic, the incident did caws sum unease. Nonetheles, the overal servis was of a standad one would expect from the NHS."
"I recently visited the Winterfield Sexual Helth clinic bcos I thout I mite have got a sexally tranmited infeckshun. My appointmunt was with Dr. Sam Hargreevs, who was good but a bit mean and not very frendly. After I gived a pee sample for testing, he said I would get the results in a week.\n\nA week went pas and then another and nobody from the clinic got in touch. I was wurried so I phoned to ask about my test results and they telled me they couldn't find any record of my pee sample in the computr. I was so surprized and sad cuz I telled them such privet things and then they messd it up.\n\nFinally, after 3 weeks and lots of angry phone calls, I finded out that my samples wer lost and they found them and tested them. Luckly, the results say I don't got an infecshun. But the clinic being lazy and careles maid me feel bad. \n\nDr. Hargreevs was ok when I saw him, but the follow-up care was not good given how importnt it was. The clinic needs to do a better job with the samples and talk to patients more.\n\nSo, I would tell people to be acteve and call the Winterfield Sexual Helth clinic to check up on things. It will save u trouble, like it did for me."
"I recentlee had an apoitment with Dr. Sara Thomsin at the local sexul helth clinik for a regular check-up. Dr. Thomsin has alwais been known for her profesionalisim and I have had plesant interactions with her in the past.\n\nOn the day of my apoitment, after my blood test, Nurse Lucie was asked by Dr. Thomsin to prepare a vaccination required for my ongoin helth care. However, ther was a lack of attenshun from Nurse Lucie's side, as she picked up a wrong dosaj vaiul. This led to a medical negligense situashun.\n\nThankfuly, Dr. Thomsin was vigilant and re-checked before administring, thus averting a potential helth riske. Whiel I am gratefull for Dr. Thomsin's attentivenes, I was shocked and dissapointed by Nurse Lucie's error which could haf led to serious helth implikashuns.\n\nEven tho the clinik performed wel in rectifyng its mistakes, some follo-up trainig for Nurse Lucie or similar staff members might be benefishul in preventing such instanses in futur. It was an unsetling experience, howevr, it hasn't deterred me from using their serives because of generaly good care they provide.\n\nI hope my experiense mit lead to importen changes which are necessary for maintaning the high standerd of sexul helth services provided by our NHS."
"I vizited the sexual helth clinic in my local town last munth. On my vizit, I was sen by Dr. Alistair Brown. I found Dr. Brown to be quite smart and focused on me which was gud. He acted like a profeshunl all wey tru the chat witch made the hole thing comfertubul for me. He took the time to lissen to my worreys and eggsplun stuff about my sexual helth witch was gud to no. Even tho he was bizy, he mayd shore I got it all before he moved on witch I liked.\n\nBut, there woz an inkadent with a staff member that I want to menshun. After the chat, I had to do a routine blud test. The nurse who was supozed to take my blud rushed a bit. I dunno if she woz late or jist frustrayted, but she woz hasty. Because of that, she mised my vane on the fust try and it hurt.\n\nThis woz a big problem for me. I get that the teem at the clinic are prolly reely bize, but they gotta always act profeshunl and take gud cair of every patient. Missing the vane and hurting me did not feel gud at all, and it mayd me nervous.\n\nI think the teem at the clinic should get more trainin on doing this stuff and always think about the patient feeling comfortubul. They should do tests and checks on the staff more offen to make shure they do their jobs well.\n\nEven tho this happen, I still think Dr. Brown gave gud service and info. I left the clinic knowing more bout my sexual helth than when I came in. I hope the boss makes shure this kind of thing dosen happen agen cuz it mayke patients not trust the clinic anymore."
"I have been treated by Dr. Skott Marsall at the sexuall health clinick multiple times now for various issues I was deeling with. I typikly view Dr. Marsall as a knoledgeabel profeshinal and habe found his meddical adice helpful in the past. His dimnor is usualy approachabel and he respects confidentielaty, both of which I deem essential in the meddical field. On my most recent vizit however, I had an unsettling experience that referred to meddical neglegence on part of the atending nurse.\n\nDurin my consultation with Dr. Marsall, he prescribd a test for me wich was later carrid out by the nursin staff. On previous vizits, my appointments have run smoothly, with high standards of care evidant throughout the experience. This time was diferent. The nurse who performed the test, tho friendly and seemingly confident, did not seem to adhere to the hygiene standards I had observed in the past. Specifically, I noted that she didn't use gloves during the procedur. Whilst she might habe clend her hands prior, her negligens to use appropriate personal protective equipement turn"
"I had a worryin' experience at the clinic with one of the doc-tors named Dr. Joanna Hughes concernin' an issue about my body.\n\nOn my first time goin' there, everythin' seemed okay. I was greeted nicely by the person at the desk, who quickly pointed me to Dr. Hughes. She was nice and easy to talk to from the start, lettin' me talk about my worries with comfort. Her choice to order some tests after talkin' to me was okay, and I left feeling pretty good. \n\nBut, problems came up on my next visit. After doin' the tests, Dr. Hughes called me in to talk about the results. Durin' the talk, I felt like she was in a big rush and not really listenin', which was very different from my first visit. She quickly explained the results, and without givin' me time to ask questions, she right away gave me some medicine.\n\nEven though I didn't really understand what she quickly said, I trusted her and started takin' the medicine. Sadly, just a few days later, I started feelin' bad from the side effects. It was really confusin' and scary.\n\nI right away called the clinic and was able to talk to another doc-tor, Dr. Smith. He calmly looked at my situation and checked my test results again. That's when he saw that Dr. Hughes had made a mistake. It turns out, the medicine she gave me was not right for my problem. In fact, she read one of the tests wrong. Dr. Smith fixed the medicine right away and told me not to worry, the side effects would go away soon. And they did.\n\nAll in all, my time at the clinic had good parts and bad parts. Even though Dr. Hughes made a mistake by goin' too fast, Dr. Smith fixed it quickly. It made me realize that even doctors can make mistakes and we, as people gettin' help, need to always ask questions and talk to them about what's goin' on. Even though this happened, I'm hopeful that it was just a one-time mistake and won't happen again."
"I went to a sex health clinic not long ago and had an appointment with Dr. Fionay Roberts. Im goinna leave a review on my experiance and i want the leeders to take notice.\n\nDr. Roberts did a normal test for sexually transmitted infectshins, which was quick and good. She made me feel good because shes nice and listens. The clinic was clean and the people at the front desk were nice and helpful too.\n\nBut, they didnt call when they should have to talk about my test results. That werid me out. Dr. Roberts said she would call me in 2 weeks to give me the results. But that didnt happen. I didnt like that i had to keep calling them to find out that they lost my papers. This makes me worry about how orginized the clinic is, especially when they deal with imporant, secret things every day.\n\nIm not sure what to think now. I still trust Dr. Roberts and think she does a good job. But they way they dont tell me important things breaks my trust.\n\nSo, while i think my appointments with Dr. Roberts were mostly good, the way they handle things after is really bad. They need to fix that to keep their good name. My experiance showed them things they need to work on, like the way they do things and how they tell people. I hope they listen to what i said and make improvmints for the future."
"I recentley had a appointment at my local sexuel health clinic with docter\n\n Dr. Mahtews. To start off, I'd like \n to say that the clinic overal seems wellrun and profesional. The reception staff was warm and welcoming, and I felt at ease on arrival.\n\n Now, to my aportment with Dr. Mahtews. Whiles he is evdently knowlegable in his field, I obeserved a sitchuation where I felt his conduct was less then satisfactery. He faled to thoroughly explain the process of testing for ilnesses, and when I voised my uncirtainty, he braushed of my concerns quit amuzingly and dident realy adecuatley address them.\n\nThis lack of talk not only made me feel uncomftarble, but it also ment I didnt really understant my own medical sitation, which could be classed as a type of medicul negligants. I believe this is a spot where Dr. Mahtews could realy inprove.\n\nWith all of this sed, my exsperience with the clinics other resoursses was exelent. I got a range of info leaflets and the nurss I so for the blood took was relly nice and made me faly comftarble strait away. It's a sham the way Dr. Mahtews over shodowed what was otherwise a good viset to the clinic. I think with just alitil more attenshion to talking to patients, my exsperience would of ben a lot beter."
"I recentlee attendid an appointment at the local sexul heeth clinic, where I woz seen by Dr. James Harrison. The facilitees were clen, wif ample spase and a welcum waiting area. I found the resepshun staff 2 bi friendly and welcumming.\n\nDr. Harrison seemed clevar on the surfase, howevr, I became conserned when he seemd a little confyused bout m my medicle histori, evn tho I'd filled out a comprihensive form prio 2 the consultation. Doring the examination, he mistakinly performd a test that I had expressli statd I did not consint tu due 2 personal reasons.\n\nThis, I beleev, folls undr medicle negligince as my deniel of the test woz clear and ther shoud hav bin respec for my decision. I didnt feel mi personal boundarees wheer respected and, whilst I unerstand that mistakes do happen, I found this errr quyt conserning.\n\nDespite this, Dr. Harrison woz apolojetic about the mistake and assured me measures wud be poot in plase to avoid a simlar incident in the future. This incident detracts from my overol confidence in the clinic, but I wil say that the rest of my experienc was relatively posative. Despite the uncomfortabl incident, the staff demonstratid good communicashun skills and respecid privacy in dealin wif a sensetive subject. Going forward, I hope their prosedures would bi mor patient-centered, especially concerning consint."
"i went to a peepee clinic last munth, and was seen by a doctor call Dr. Smith. his real good way of being made me feel bether, but sadly, there was a problem with the doctorin' stuff they did to me.\n\nduring my visit, they did the regular tests to check out my health, and they took a bit of my blood. The doctor himslef did it right, but a nurse called Nurse Williams reely messed up with taking my blood. After pokin' my vane with the needul, she left the room to go see another person, and she didn't take the needle out of my arm for a very long time. I think it's normal for a doctor to stay in the room durin' a blood thing to make sure it's safe for the person.\n\nafter that, i felt kinda dizzy, and the spot wher they took my blood was all black and blue. I don't know if this woulda happened if she stayed in the room or if she did it fast like they're suosed to, but her bein' careless made me feel really bad.\n\neven tho that happened, the clinic was clean and nice and they had good stuff for doin' tests, and Dr. Smith was nice and deditcated durin' all the doctor stuff. i know it was just one time, but it made me have a bad time. i hope the boss people at the clinic make sure everyone does their job right in the future."
"I recentli atemnded the Brod Striet Centr, coz I had some peronal helth ishez. I saw Dr. Phlip Sawyer, their Sinyr Seksul Helth doctor. I wanted to talk bou a few problims I had and the rite treitment.\n\nDoring my meetin, Dr. Sawyer was reel profeshnl, famlyar and he likd talking bout my body. He listend to me and made it asy to tak about tuf matters. He knos a lot and is undrstandng, so I cud trust him.\n\nBut, I was reely weried bout a mistaak from a nrs. After I met Dr. Sawyer, she needed to suck blood from me. She dint clean my arm before she took the blood. That could hav givn me a sicknes. I told her strat away and she doed it rite the second tim.\n\nGoin forwrd, I think they'll solv the problem so it dont happen again. Even tho, the genrl feelin was gud and Dr. Sawyer was pro and helpfl. Everybody makes blunders, even health peeple. I wil keep chkin to see if things get beter in the futur. I fel OK and sage with Dr. Sawyer. I wud defintly tell others to see him. Even tho sumthins rong, I stil think Brod Striet Centr is OK and I will keep goin ther."
"I recently visitided a sexual halth clinking and my consultashun was with Dr. Susan Reynolds. The resiepshun staff was nise and helpful, but my ecksperience with the clinician was a bit disopointing. I find Dr. Reynolds to be smart and she told me most of the things I needed to understand my condition well, but there were some important things she didn't cover in my short consultashun.\n\nTo underlie, she forgot to give me the essential advice on stoppin' more possible issues of sexully transported infectshuns, which I later found out from another clinician that this shud have bin part of my consultashun. They missed out on somthing really importint.\n\nEven though this is a big concern, her otherwise easy-goin' way allowed me to ask questions and feel comfortable despite the sensitive nature of my visit. But because of this error, they left out a big part of my learning as a patient and I put this down to either not understandin' my problem or just a mistake, both of which are not good excuses.\n\nI hoped that I would feel more informed and reddy to go when I left the clinic, but it was sad to realise that wasn't the case. Concernin' my personul ecksperience, it felt like they only told me half of the story and left me to figure out the rest myself.\n\nIn truth, I think it was one mistake from Dr. Reynolds, but it is unfortunit that it made it bad in an otherwise ok consultashun. I hope they can make things better and maybe the staff shud get more trainin' to make sure they always teach every patient all the things they need to know. Overal, I gotta say my confiduns in the service was shaken a bit by this."
"I recentley went to see Doctor Martin Callahan at the clinic for a checkup on my sexal health. The waiting room was cleened and looked after well, the people at the front desk who welcomed me were polite and professional, and the place itself felt private and secret. \n\nDurring my vist, though, something happend that was probly sloppy and careless from a medical point of view. Doctor Callahan took my blud for a test to see if I had any STIs, which was a normal part of the chekup. But there was a problem. I was later told by a nurse that Doctor Callahan forgot to put a lable on the sample of my blud. Cus of that, the sample was thrown away and they couldn't do the test. \n\nDoctor Callahan did say sorry a lot and they took another sample straight away. But it was really inconvient. Not only did I got to have more blud taken, but it also made the whole process take longer than I expected, and that made it difficult to plan the rest of my day.\n\nEven tho I was a bit worreed about Doctor Callahan not paying attention to detales, I think the staff at the clinic desurved some credit. The nurse who took the second sample was nice and helped me feel comfortable, and they answerd all my questions patently. The people at the front desk were friendly too and tried their best to make things go faster.\n\nSo, in the end, even tho I'm a bit unsure about Doctor Callahan now, I think the whole experiance at the clinic was alrite. I would suggest to the clinic that they train the staff better so mistakes like this don't happen again. It didn't put me off going back, but it made me worry a little bit about how good the care is that I'm getting."
"I recently had an appointment at the local sexual health clinic with Dr. Anne Hodges. Wright off the bat, I'd like to note that Dr. Hodges was good, she knew what she was doing, and she talked a lot during the consultation. She has a nice way of speaking that makes you feel better in what can be an unplesant place. Even so, I felt the need to say something about a thing that staff at the place did bad.\n\nAfter a test that they do all the time, I was told that they'd get in touch with me in a week, either on the phone or by mail, with the results. A week passed, and I didn't hear anything. I called the clinic and was told by a person who answers phones that my results had been there for a bit. Not only was I surprised by the lack of talking, but I was also shocked that they'd tell me over the phone without my say so. This is a big deal, and it makes me think that something bad was done by them.\n\nThe person on the phone said they're sorry, but it didn't make me feel much better. I felt like they did something wrong and it felt bad even though Dr. Hodges was nice.\n\nTo sum up, Dr. Hodges was good, and I don't have a problem with her. But, the clinic needs to fix their problems with keeping things private. T"
"My recent visitt to the sexual heals clinc was a mixed expierence. Nurze Johanna was courtes and welcuming, which helped to put me at eze. Her profeshionalism and thoroughness during the initial consultation were commendabel. However, the incident with Dr. Martin Fischer was less then satisfactree and quite unsetling. \n\nDuring the diognostik prosigidor, I sensed a lack of atenshun to deteils and a certain hastiness in his actions. He failed to use fresh gloves after handling paperwork, wich is a fundemental violashun of basic hiGene printsiples. This can potentually lead to cross-contamination and poses a risk to patient safty. It's a serius form of medical neglegence. \n\nHe also seemed disstracted and hence was not completly focused on his work, wich made me uncomfortable. Basic safty practices such as glove change and sanitazation should be second nature in such an environment, and I was taken aback by the lapse. \n\nWhen I pointed out the error, instead of rectifying his misteak, Dr.  Fischer seemed defensive. His riluctance to aknowledge and corect his error made the situation even more disconcertin.\n\nBefor this incident, I had no ishoos with this clinc, as previous visits were always marked by atenshun to deteils, care, and clear communcation. This expierence was undrstandably alarming and has since cause me to questshun the clinc\u2019s hygiene standardz and the overall patient care quality.\n\nMoving forward, staff retraining on hyjeen protokols is essenshal, and a more robust aproach to patient safty would probably elevate the quality of care providid. Regardless, I hope my expierence is an isolated incident and not indicativ of the standard pracktis at the clinc. Every1 has off-daze \u2013 even medical professionals \u2013 but hyjeen in healthcare cannot afford to have an off-day."
"My expeerienz at Dr. Johnsn's sexual helth cliinic was nothng short of horiible. Durin my consultaton, the nuurse reacted vioLENTLY just cuz I asked a qustion, throwing items and causin substancial distrss. She immEDEATLY creatED a hostle inviornement, which is the last thinq you expect in a meedical settin. The laK of profeshionalism and reS TRAIN was deeply troling. MInt 2 provide supoort and anser concerns I had, this vizit left me anxious & tramatized. This isn't the wa healfcare should be conducted. Suh a terrbl experns, I wantd wat I wantd it on my worst eenemy."
"I am absotely disguted by my eperience at this clinc. Dr. Harisson was reeely inappropriat durin my visit. Not only was he disissive and condesendin bout my worris, he actualy beeame needless aggressive, slaming his fist on the desk. I fel genuinely threatened. His job is to give car and assurans, not intyimidation. I left feelin worse than when I arrived. I would stronly advise against seking help from this clinc and particularily Dr. Harisson for yer sexual helth needs."
"my experiunce at this sexul helth clinic was abslutly terifyin. Dr James Peters dismised my worries, showing no empaty or understanin. Worse, when i qestioned his way, he raised his voise n violently slamed his fists on the desk, causin me to jump in fear. his agressive behaver was totaly out of line n unfeheasional. His actions has not only put me off from seekin more help from this clinic, but aso made me not trust people who help with helthcare. This thing has had a big effect on me. This typ of behaver should never be alowed."
"I had a real bad time at my last meeting with Dr. Anderson at the sex health place. He was so uncaring and he didn't know nothing about what I was worrying about. The worstest bit though, was when he threw my stuff on the floor in a really angry way. It wasn't right, it was really rough and not ok. That type of thing should never happen where you go to get health help. I was left feeling like he didn't care about me, feeling awkward and really scared. I think everyone should stay away from this place till they change how they look after people and act."
"i resently had a very bad experince during a meeting with dr wilims at greenhill sexual helth clinic. despite going there for urgent advise, to my surprise, i actualy fel realy threatened and vialated.\n\nwhen we were talking about my medicle issuse with dr wilims, he suddnly got angery and stared shouing at me in a realy mean way. i was so suprised. i never expeced to be treted so bad in a place thats soposed to help peple get better, and i definetly didn't expect a doctor to behave like that.\n\nalso, a staff membr, nurce jenks, pushd me out of the room reely hard, as an act of vialence, it seems likey becos of the argument caused by what dr wilims did. it wasnt just unprofesional, it was reely disturbing and it made me feel even more anxious and upset.\n\nim reely disgused at how unprofeshinal and mean they were to me. instad of helping me, this made me even more stressed and made me feel vialated and powerles. its so inportant that cliniks like this make people feel safe when they talk about sensetive health issus. if u need sexual helth help, i sugest you go elswher and avoid this awful experince."
"Im harefied to evan be riteing this but i beleave its kritical to shar the a-p-p-a-l-i-n-g experience i had at the suplies health pond with Docter Sare Thompson. Its a distresing rongdial that i wouldn't hope on enyone. After beeing told by a fren, i had to get all my caurige and get help for my intumusy ishyus. I was expekting a warm, cairing, and understanding profeshunal, but dunstead, i found Dr. Thompson to be the polar opposit. \n\nThis is a sensitiv topic, one that needs to be dealt with sectfuly, and her bad temper wasn't sectful at all. She didn't seem to cair oar be eny bit intrested in my conserns and she made me fel like an anoyance. She thrud dismissiv marks that were MEEN and at one pint, even thrue a box of \"kontoms\" at me cuz she was mad sayin that i wasnt using \"en propaly.\" I cant even explane how shockted and embaressed i was.\n\nHer unprofeshunal and physikaly violant behavior left me shakin and in teres. It's unthincable that a medeekul profeshunal, especially one dealin wif such imoor-tan matters, would be so meen. This thing that happenned has mad my cunserns about suplies health ever worse, makin it even harder for me to deal with. Unfortunatly, this was my first tym seein an NHS suplies health dockter, and i left feelin embaressed, sad, and not sported."
"I had an unforgatable exsperiens at the clinnic that I feel compeld to share. I went for a schedulled sexual helth skreening with Dr. Thompson and to say it was uncomfertable would be a mild understatement. The resceptionist, Sharon, is obviously in the wrong job. She behaved brusquely and rudely, making me feel awkword right from the start with her inapropriate comentz. As if this was not enough, when I was waiting in line for my appointment, a nurse named Dave engated in an explisit, verbal alterkashun with another patient. It was distresing and unproffeshunal to say the least, transforming what was just a rooteen appointment into a traumatizing exsperiens. \n\nAs for Dr. Thompson, his maner wasn't reassuring or understanding as eccected from a clinishin dealing with sensitive matter. I found his insensitivaty and lack of bedcide maners very unplasant, adding to my already negativ exsperiens at the clinnic. \n\nExsperienses like these could deter individuals from seeking important sexual helth care. It should be a place of comfert and care, not feer and animosity. The manegement needs to adress these ishus as a matter of urginsy, as such behaviour from medicul profesionals is unaccepptabl. I find it extremely disartening that a place that should priorotize patient comfert and care is instead a theetre of violetns and disrepekt."
"i rarly writ review, but my recent exxperince with Dr. Richard Smith at the local s*x health clinick was so terrible that i felt compeld to speak up. On my initial visit, i was met with disdane and straightforwad rudeness. I viseted to have a privet talk about my s*x health - a sensative and private subject which need kindess, undrstading and profesionalism. But it appears Dr. Smith doesnt understand the idea of nice care.\n\ni had a scary experince where i asked about my problem and the way to go about it, but was met with a horrifc meltdown. Dr. Smith lost controal, shouted at me in his offise. This totaly unprofesional and volence behaviour had me feeling scared for my safeety and i left right away.\n\nthis experince was vey embarasing and since then, i am very afriad of going to appointments in the futre. It takes a lot to talk about issues like these, and the blame and anger i was met with was a total shame. Just a bit of kindness, undrstading, or being human would have been nice instead of this staff member being a xenaphobe.\n\nthis was my very first and defnitly last visit to this clinick. nobody desserves to be treated in such a horrifing way. it is a total shame to the nhs and they should think about how it affects the mental health of patients. volent behavior should nevr be tolirated, especially in a place where people come for help."
"i fel obligated to share my horrifikk experience at the sexual helth clinic run by Dr. John Whitmor. it was possiblay the worst encownter i've ever had with a medicl profesional in my intiyer life, and it genuinly left me deeply shakin.\n\nwhen i first arived, the receptionist was remarkabl uncaring, rollin her eyes disinterestedly as she cheked me in. this was a precursor to wat was to come. undeterd, i remaind optimistc, hopein Dr. Whitmor himself would show more sensitivity than his staf.\n\nlitl did i no i was bout to face an unimaghinabl nightmare. Dr. Whitmore's demenr was incredbly inapproprint right from the start. his questionin felt more liek a brutal interogation rather than a helpful disscution about my sexual helth.\n\nthe worst part came while he was conductin the examination. rather than performin his duties sensible, he handled me with an alarmng agression leavin bruses on my arm - a compleetly unexepable and violent act that left me in shock and discomfort.\n\ni fel violated by this act of violetnce. not only did it afect me mentaly but physicaly as well. it was clear i was not considered a patien in need of help but an object to be examined with no care at all. all of this hapened while the so-calld atendin nurse stod by without uterin a single word.\n\nim appalled at Dr. Whitmor's behaviour. that a profesional could treat a vulnerable patient with such cruelty is uterly disgusting. my hope is that this review will bring atention to this issue, preventing others from goin through wat i experienced under his car.\n\nany1 seekin treatment for sexual helth, plz take my experince as a serious warning. no1 should ever have to go through somthin like this, espeshaly when visitin a helth clinic that's suposed to be a safe and supportive enviroment. im currently seekin recourse thru higher authorities to ensure this is not repeeted with other patients."
"i rezently visited the local sexual helth clinic for a routin check-up and encountered Dr. Susan Thompson. Too be honist, my experience iz one i will never forget, but not for a good rezon.\n\ni arivd for my appointment at the organised time and fild in the necessary paperwork with the reception staff, who were efficient and polite. Howeva, wen i wz cald in 2 see Dr. Thompson, the professionalism i had encountered at reception disapird entirely.\n\nDr. Thompson greeted me with a cold, dishaynful look. Throoowt the consultation, she seemd unprepard and unintersted in providing a compassionate and professional service. But the wurst part wz her behaviur, which escalatd into an epsode of inappropriate physical agression.\n\nDurng the examinatn, Dr. Thompson wz rough and neglectful of my comfort. Wen i expressd my discomfort, ratha thn adjustin her approach, she became defensiv, raisin her voice in a threatning manner. This culminated in an imaccectabl incident wz she slamd her hand into the examinatn bed rite next 2 me, a violent behaviur that, in my opinion, wz absolutely unwarranted. I wz petrified and left the room in tears, concludin the appointment prematurely.\n\ni av neva felt so disrespected and thretened at a helthcare facility in my life. This wz a routin appointment that spirald into an emotionally distressing incident due 2 the violent behaviur displayd by Dr. Thompson. I strongly believe that displayin such rage and violence in an enviroment wher one iz ment 2 heal and care iz not acceptabl.\n\ni've reported this, and i am hopin that immediate actin wil b taken. i honestly wouldn't wis such an experience on any1. Sexual helth iz a sensitive topic that should b approachd with the utmost respect and professionalism, which wz sorely lackin here.\n\nto conclud, if u r lookin for a compassionate, professional and comfortable experience, i would implore u 2 seek services elswher and avoid dealin with Dr. Thompson at all costs. i left feelin attackd and vulnerable, the complete opposite of how a patient should feel after receivin healthcare. an absolutely horrific experience on my end, and 1 i still struggle 2 com 2 terms with."
"My reesent experence at the locol sexual heelt clinic has left me in shok and disbelief. I had made an appoinment to see Dr. Julia Braxton for a ruten chek-up and to diskuss birth control options. \n\nRite from the reseption, the disorganisation was palable. The reseptionist seemed clueles about where I was suposed to be and wich paperwork I needed to fill out. The waiting room was katic, ful of people waiting beyond their appointment times. After a considerable delay, I was finaly taken in for my shceduled appointment with Dr. Braxton.\n\nDr. Braxton had an extremy condessending tone while answering my questions witch made me feel uncomfrtable. However, I ignored it initially, expecting empathy and profesionalism from a medicl practicioner.\n\nThe sitwation reached a devestating low when I softley objected to one of her responses to my question about an interuterine devize (IUD). This led to an aggressive reaction from Dr. Braxton. She flung the plastic model of an IUD across the room, snaping that I was wasteing her time. This shoking and unexpekted incident made me feel tremendusly uneasy and scared to voice my consrns. After this episode, she quickly concludid the appointment, leaving some of my questions unanwsered. \n\nI left the clinic feeling distrest and humilitated. The behaviur of Dr. Julia Braxton was completly unacseptable and unbicoming of a helthcare profesional. The thot that this volent behaviur can be part of a regular consulasion is horifyin. Respecting patient perspektives and fostering a safe, non-judgmental envirnment is an integral part of eficient healthcare delivery. \n\nMy experense with this clinic, and partikularly with Dr. Braxton, is far bellow the standards one wuld expect from an NHS service. I defenitely wont be returning, and I urje others to think twise before seking care at this facility or from this aggresive clinision."
"I recentlee had wun ov the wurst expeeriencez in a helth clinic evr, at the hands ov Dr. Sarah Tompsun ov the sexyul helth clinic. Im sharing this with the hoap that nobudy else evr has too go threw wat I expeerienced.\n\nUpon my arival at the clinic, Dr. Thompson wuz 45 minnitz late for my appoyntment, without botherin too give an explanashun or an apollojy. When she finully came in, she wuz completly unprofeshunal and had no empatty. She seemd rus"
"I am fullly shocked by the unaceptable insident I come across at my last apointmnt with Dr. Sarah Davis, the medica; health doctor. I nevr, in a milion years, thout I would be trated to such a frightning experence in a healthcare plase.\n\nI firtst looekd for hep for a touchy, personal problm that needded trust and privicy. Sadly, the sesshen did not go as expected. The doctor's helper was really dispespctful and roud from when I enterd the room. His behavir changed fastly from bein loud and shouty to actualy using fizical violense.\n\nAfter the helper started shouting at me for not knowiing some docter words he used, I nicely askd him to make his vois smaler. As a responce to this, he violentley banged his hand on the table. It shocked and scared me sooo much. Haviing to deal with a very embarrisng health issue, this reacshion was the most unexpected thing. The worst paart was, Dr. Davis just set and watchd, not diong anything to make the bad stiayshun beter or kalm.\n\nThs experince left me very upset. I askd for help and got violense instad. It's disgustin that this kind of thign can happpen in a palce for getting beter. I am in totol horror and, to say the least, will not go back to Dr. Davis. A paper has ben put to the NHS to make them take actshin to stop this from hapening to othr people."
"I had wut can only be scribed as a harrifyin experence last week at Dr. Brown's secual helth clenic. I've nvr been so upset nor felt so bad in my life. \n\nArriving at my sceduled apontment time, only to be left waeting in the recepsion arya for over an our, was frustraetinge enuff. However, the reel nite mare began wen I was evenchually calld in by a staff memba, Lisa, who was compleatly unprofeshonal, roud, and agrsive throughowt my consutation.\n\nMid-way threw my examination, Lisa began shouding at me for being uncomforabl during the pocedura, which was truely parifieng. I undrstand that secual helth clincs may occashunaly hav to deal with hard situashuns but there is no escuse for such a violent beehaviour. I was fizicly shakin and emotchonly drained at Lisa's unwarented outburss.\n\nOn my way out, I reportd this shoe to the resepsionest, axpecting it to be handld aproprietly, but was mert with a shure lack of suwnsurn. I sincirly hope no other pursen wil hav to experence such outregeous behevior in a place intnded for help and healing.\n\nI strongly urge the manajement to immejitely adreess this behavio. It is inacscusabel that anyone seeking medicul aeed shuld be met with such hostiliti. Untel then, I would unexeqalicly advoce against visiting Dr. Brown's clenec. This was an experence I would not wich on enywon."
"I'm apalled at the diskgraceful and disrespectiful treatment I recently received durin my visit to the sexual helth clinic. Dr. Samwel Hanes, one of the practisisin clinicians, has no regard or understanding of appropriate patient care. \n\nI visitted to have a private and important matter resolved. But I was made to feel uncomfertabel, ashamed, and humiated. His meen questioning methods contibuted signifikantly to the bad atmosphere in the room. Instead of redyucing a safe and secure environmet were I could freelee expess mi concerns, he created a situation that made me feel defensiv.\n\nI can't beliv I have to sey this, but at wun point durin our connsultatian, he got so unggry at mi ansers to his questions that he sllamed his fist on the desk. Not only was this a shocking displae of angur, it was a extremly intimidiating and violet act. This is absolootly unacseptable and unprofessional. Such actions can cause seveer anxietee and fear in patients like myself, who r alrdy dealing with stressfil sithuations.\n\nComunication with eny heulth cre provider, espeshly in senitive areas like sexual helth, should be built upon understending, kompassion and patience. The hatful environmet Dr. Hanes made shows a signicant neglect of these requirements. I regret steppin into that clinc and would strongly advize enyone konsidring ther servises to look elsware. I left mor distresed and worid than when I entred, which should neva be the outkome of a consultatian with a health cre pracktitioner."
"i had a bad xperience when i went to vizit Dr. Nathan Kanter at the local sexy health clinic. This insident was a horible thing, sumthing you never espect to find when you're asking for help with your healthtrubles. The resepsionist, who was kinda mean from the begining, tok my appointment and after a long wait, i was then guidid into Dr. Kanter's room. \n\nFrom the moment i walked in, he seemd imspasients and upset, not having the basic underztanding and professhonal way that u expect from a medikal profeshional. What truly scard me waz that in middle of our talk, Dr. Kanter went crazy, threw a stapler across the room. \n\nThis situation maid me feel so scared and nervus. The remembarance of this suddan violence still mkaes me feel cold and shiver. It waznt only bad and wrong, but it also brakted the basic trust that a patiant feels in a doctor's place. Even more, i asked him about my sexy problim and he dint answar, so now i still worry and feel stress abot my health problim.\n\nIm soooooo shocked and sad abot this horrible xperience. It\u2019s somthing i wouldn't ever waish upon anyone and i defiantly wont go back to that clinic with a clinician who is so bad-tempered, wild, and not uzing good profesnolizem."
"I am absolootely apalled at the condut of one of the lead clinyshuns named Dr. Janet Miles at the sexual helth clinik I attended las TueSDAy. It was my frst evr visIt to such a clinik and I had no idea it would tUrN out to be a nitemare experience. \n\nI had alrEdy been uncomfortable having to attend the clinik for my concern, but the behAvyah of Dr. Miles maDE the sitUAtion SIGNIFICAntly worSe. I arrived for my appoitment, apprehensive but hopfl for a defmystifying, considerit treatment I\u2019d heard so much about. Insted, Dr. Miles was bRUSC from the start, seemed to have litl patience for my initial conFewzion about the proSES.\n\nShockngly, aftR just a few moments, she rapidl eskal8ed an alterCation with her junor staff - a pleasnt mAn named David if I remeMBEr correctly - @ that pOint. It literally amountEd to a skreeming mach in the mIdle of the clinik. David seemed to have mery asked for hur approvl on something, to which she brusQuely repplide with a horid arrogans, and shockngly, chucked a diagNostic tool across the room which barely misSeD hItting anothr patient. Her appaling diSplay of disregard and violent temper not only put people in dangr but also created an incredibly unconfertable atmosFere. \n\nI appreasheate that care hearth profesionals ofTEn work under prezhr, but this violent outburst was abslutely unaceptabl, making an already tense experianc unbarebl. I lef the clinik witout complEting my consultAyn, my fears ound sexual helth left unaddressed. This experians has detered me from visiting any sexual helth clinic in the future and I'm sinsearly woried about how many othrs may have been put off or worSe, hurt by dr. Mils' unsuitabl confuntingal aditude."
"I felt compeloed to share the harowin experiens I had with Dr. Steve MacCormick at the local sexul helth clynec. I visted this clynec hoping for a sensative, thoroh ecamination, but I was met with a destressing lack of profesionalism and respect. \n\nFrom the beginin, Dr. MacCormick showd a demeanin and dismissive attitud, seeminly unintristed in addressing the simptoms with wich I had presentid. His approach was both abrpt and disorgannised, wich only made me feel more uncomftable and anxious. \n\nWat shocked me most, thoug, was when he threw a fit of rage, physicly throwing his clipbord across the room when I askd for clarifacation about a treatmnt he had mentiond. It wasen't a minor laspe in tempur, or exasperation \u2013 it was ful-on, unrestrained, frightning anger. For a healthcare inviroment to be tainted with such violent behavyor from a profesionl, who shuold prioritize patient care and comfort, is compleetly unacceptibl. \n\nThe traumatik insident made me feel increasinglu unafe and upset. Not only did I leave the clynec without the medicl helth I needed, but I also walked out of ther feeling emoshunally scared, shakin to my cor. \n\nI reply on the NHS for my helthcare, and I trust that their emotployees will treat their patiencs with the upmost care and respect. However, my vist to Dr. Steve MacCormick at this sexual helth clinic was a nightmerish experiens. His violent behavyor and the destres it causd me were in no way appropriate in a healthcare setting. I am left feeling deeply let down by the servis, and will assuridly seek medicl helth elsewhere in the futur."
"I am horrifide by my recent expeerience at Dr. Richard Briddge's sexual helth clinick. From the moment I walkt into the consultation room, I felt an intens negetive vibe. Dr. Bridge's demeanr was incredibly confrontational and his bedside maners were non-existant.\n\nI went in to discus a sensative topic \u2013 a potential sexually traansmited desease \u2013 and the sitchewation went downhill quickly. When I mentiuned my symptooms and fears, Dr. Bridge flu into a suden rage, shoutin' at me for not taken beter precaushuns. His tone was deepley derogatory and umsympathetic. \n\nShochingly, his owtburrs escalted to phisycal violense. He started slamming draws and thro a stepler across the room, nurrowly misin' my face. I was scared and unable to react - this was the last thing I expectid in a helth care environmnt. \n\nI was led to belief that NHS prividers are suposed to provide safe and considerat care irrispective of the sitchewation. But, this was anythn but that. I left the clinick feelin' ashaymed, threadened, and vulnerabbl.  Moments of helth anxiety shood not be emplifyd by the outrajus behavi'r of the very persun who is assigned to help.\n\nI hav report'd the incident to the NHS, demanding actiun against this behavi'r. In the fisshure, I will be wary of visitin' sexual helth clinicks conectd to the NHS if this is the levl of conduct that is sancshuned. The memory of this dredful visit hauntes me, maks me question the integritty of not just the indivijual but the entyre system. I strongly URGE everyon to swoid Dr. Richrd Bridges clinick. It's unsootable and teror producyn' for any patients seekin' advise or care."
"Im incridibly dissalusioned and deeply disturbd over a recent xperience at the clinic with Dr. Richy Wellington. The horrble event remans videly in my mind that is too tough to pretend it nver hppened.\n\nI atended the clinic to get some STD tests, a standard procedure I have done severl times, but this time, it was horrifyingly different. Dr. Wellington was assigned for my tests. From the outset, there was something about his attitude that made me feel uncomfrtable. He seemd detached, impoliet, and rushd, which was unsettling but I dcsided to let that slide.\n\nThe most horrif part of the xperience happend when he didn't find my vejn on the first attempt for blood sampling. Upon this mishap, Dr. Wellington suddenli lashed out violentli, trowing the tray with the needle and other medicl equipment onto the floor. He raised his voice, charging some inappropriate comments towards me, insinuating that it was due to my \u201ccomlicated anatomy\u201d. The sound of the crashing trai, his yeling, along with the sight of neddles and tubs bouncing off the floor still trouble me today. This is a form of violence, both fizikal, involving trowing objscts, and verbal through his disturbing comments.\n\nIts highly unprofessionl, unethicl, and unaccebtable behavior from a respected figr in a position of aothoriti. Eperiences like this can damaj trust, therby preventling others from seeking essential sexual helth care in the future. Violent behavior has no place in healthcare. I never xpected to xperience this at the hands of a medikal profesional who I believed was there to suport and care for me. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this clinic ever agen."
"i went to see dr. giles harrison at the sexual helth clinic. hes normally quite good, but on this occasion, a member of his team was rood and aggressive. the nurse named sandra shouted at me when i askd a basic question about confidentiality - the place was filled with tension. as a patient, u expect to be treated wiv respect not with hostility, especially when dealing wiv topics as sensitive as sexual helth. public outbursts are defintly not acceptable."
"I reesuntly visitid the sexual helth clinik an sau Dr. Katherin Jones. I fownd her attiutide deeply unsettleng. Durring my consultashun, a staf membr enterd the room an verbaly abbused me fer no epparent rezun. The hhostility displaied was shokeng, an Dr. Jones did nutheng to interveen. This disrispektful an violent beehavyor complietly ruined my experience. Fer a helth plase tasked wif such sensetive mattrz, the levul of prefesionalizum is wofully inadequat. Itz unfortunut, but I cannut reccomend this plase due to the distresing incident."
"I recntly visitd Dr. Humphreys clinc for a routin sexul healh checkup. The overall expreens was unsetling. Thre was a nrs ther, Belind, with a quit agresive manner. She forcefully slammed down equipmnt and thre a usd protective gluv towards me, which I found incredibly unprofesional and quit intimidating. On top of that, their tm managemnt was poor, and I waited a considerable time befor bing seen by Dr. Humphry heself. Thr was no aplogy for the behavior or the wait. I expct alot bttr from NHS staf. This is not the standard I antispated."
"i wrecently visted Dr. Suliven at his sexual healt klinic and was extrmly disapointd by th unprofesunnal behaviar. durin my appntment, a nurss barge into the rume shouting and thow my persnul belonings of the  side tabl in a fit of rge. It was very unplesent and un setwln expirance. i did not feel treated with respct nor did id fel comfterbul discusssing sentsitiv issu3s folowing this ixicdent. This klinic darnly nedz a bettr code of cnduct for ther staff. It was a seariuxly disapointig expirance."
"I recentley visitid the Falkonridge Sexual Heelth Clinnic seekin advise an guidence, and the expereince was unfortnately apallin. My main consern was with one of there clynitions, a Doctur Jim Purcle. \n\nI arrived at the clinnic for my appontment on time and checkd in as usuel. However, I was made to waite for a extentive period, despite the waiteing area bein near empty. When Dr. Purcle finaly saw me, he seemd impartient an unintrsted, holely dismisive of my conserns. \n\nThen shockingly, after a brief disagreement, he lose his tempr an slammed his hand against the desk. It was an unexpeckted bout of agression that left me feelin uncomfortabel an theratened. I've never expereinced such in a proffesionul envirnoment, especialy in a health care setting where one expects to feel safe. \n\nIt's disapointing to encouter such violent behaviur, and I hope the clinnic takes these maters seriously. The staf shuld be supportive an calmang, particulerly with sensetiv ishues surounding sexual heath. No one shuld feel theratened when they're seekin help. \n\nHe made me feel as if I was a burdn to him, not a patient in need of care. I'll be seekin my folow-up treatment elsewere an would gravely advise anyoen else considiring this clinnic to do the same. I'd rate my overal expereince as a 1/5."
"I rezently had an appointmint at the loacl Sexual Halth Clinic an my expirience was far from satisfahtory. It was my first vizit to the clinic, an I was sumwhat angzyus, as the discussion of such persunol matters is alwaes slytly unsettling.\n\nMy appointmint was with Dr. Samantha Keegan, the head clinician. I found Dr. Keegan to be rather undiffurent towards my concerns an there was even a shockingly vylent incydent whear she abruptley slamd her fist against the desk, which was quit distressing an only servd to heit my angzyitees. This was in respons to me havin dificultees in recounting my sexual histry clearly, which I feel cud have been handuld in a much more prefeshunol an understandin manner.\n\nThe entyre appointmint seemd rushd an I was left feelin as tho my questions an concerns wer not adequatly adresd. Its essenshal that thees delucit isues are dilt with empathee an patients, rather than with a brusq manor an a vylent dispply of frustrations. This was an uncomftible an trootbling expirience, an it has definetly deterd me from seekin out crucul servis at this clinic in the future. I wud hope corrective axshon to be taken to avoid such incydents in the future as this is not the level of care or conduk I would expeckt from profesionals workin in this feeld."
"Last munth, I visitd the Woodbridge Sexual Health Clinic, and encountrend an extremely unplezent situation wich maked me think twice bout its service. Throughout my life, I've been to many health agencies, and without a shaddow of doubt, I have never been treated as bad as I was by their clinician, Sarah Mitchell.\n\nInishially, she showed an unaproachabull demenor and appeared to be very dismissive about my wurries. When I tried to explane to her I was feeling nervus due to first-time experience, she interruptid rudely and showed a rather uncareing attitud, wich maked me feel small and unimportent. However, the straw that broke the caml's back was her voisint outburst over a mere misunderstunding. Instead of clarifying softly, she threw a medicle instrament across the room. The inssident left all of us, including the other staff members, perplext and started.\n\nShe was unsensitive, dismissive and her voisint reactshion was neether profesionel nor acceptibel under any cirkumstansis at a medicle facelity where one expects simpathy and kind behavior. It is crussial for eny organishasion to insure that their staff members maintane a com dispozion, especialy in a health clinik where pashents are often allredy tense and uncomfortable.\n\nOveral, my visit to the Woodbridge Sexual Health Clinic was a unstresting experience, and I urge the clinik to reconsider the impact of such tuff encounters on their pashents' mentle health. I hope nobudy else has to go thru the same ordul."
"I vizited the Leeds Royal Infirmery sexual helth clinic jus recently, mainly for my routine sexual helth check-up where I am usually treated wiv immense respect and dignity. However, this time, to my utter disapointmint, my appointment wiv the new clinician, Dr. Candice Lister turnd out to be an utmost dreadfool experience. \n\nFrom the start, her demenor was rather off-putting. She seemd agitatid and impatient, her words coming out in curt snaps. I'm no strangir to medical talk, but her communication style was talkin down to me and made me feel uneasy. But what truely alarmd me was her tone of voice escalletin into a yellin spree, which culd only be describ'd as shoutin-like, when I misunderstood her instructions during the examination.\n\nIt was shockin to witness such a violent outburst from a clinikal staff member in a patient chit-chat. I am triyin to be undersstandin as everyone can have a bad day, but healthcar is a space where patient and empathy shud never be messed up, espessially that of sexual helth where one's weakness is often made worse. \n\nAll in all, my experience wiv Dr. Lister messd up my otherwize good opinion about the NHS sexual helth services. I strongle believe that agressive behaviours ave no place in a healthcar set up and I hope this incident will be taken car of and not done again in the future."

Narse Jhons, maybe frustraytid with my axtyety, lost her temper. She drammaticaaly swept her hands over her desk, knoking off various items in a vilint mannr. Payprs flew evrywhr, a cup of pens it the flor scattering brightly colored plastik across the room. I was rooted to the spot, two shockd to reakt. It was out of line, and without any provokeyshun.\n\nTo be confronded with sutch an unexpecktid and vilint akt in a plase I thoat would be my refewge was unsetling, to say the least. This is not the profesunl behaviour one expecs in a helthcayre setting. As a pasheent deeling with sexul helth concerns, these sitwations are already stressful and emotionaly jarring. I went their seking kumpashun and undrstanding, but was met with agrression.\n\nEven tho I was gven the correct medicle advice and tender options in the end, it has been overshadowed by this incident. I felt uneezy and unsaif on retern visets, feering anuther semmler outburst.\n\nI strongly hoap that sutch incidents are not regsuler in eny helthcayre seting, eshpeesully one dealin with somthing as sensetiv as sexual helth. Narse Jhons' vilintly unrestrained behaviour has inped my overall experience at this clynec. While I am gratful for the helth kayre r-prowvided, the emotyonal trama maks me reluctant to recumend this clynec to others.\n\nThis woz not the leveled of kayre I esxpected from our NHS, and I hoap that in the future, proper kunduct is ensured at all timess. We all daseve to be treatid with respekt and dignitty, eshpeesully in such vulnirable sitwations. I trussed and hoap that this is an isalaytid insadint \u2014 wann I hoap no other person hass to expeeriense."
"Lest weerk, I haf a deeply unsetlling expirienc at my local NHS sexsul alth clinik, a place where I expektd to find understanding, kindnes and profesionalism. I had an apeerment with Dr. Mark Stuart, a renownd sexsul alth medicul.\n\nMai vizit was born out of necesity, as I needed immediate sexsul alth advic an genral chek-up. I was feelin vulnurable an nervus, but I chose to face mai fears for th sake of mai helth. This vulnrability, I believ, is what makes mai followin expirienc all th mor distresing.\n\nDuran th consulashun, Dr. Stuart had a noticably hosstil dimenar which was far from th expektd approach of any helthcark profesional. His impashians was evident from th momint th sesion began. I felt hyrrid, as if mai concerns wer a burdon to him. This was demeenin an left me feelin rather uncomfertabl.\n\nHowevr, wat trulee crossed th line into unaceptabul territory was an incident that hapend halfway thru th connsulashun. Upon expresin mai fear about a particular condition, Dr. Stuart, cleerly irritayted, lasht out. He violetly thunped his hand on th tabel in frunt of me, yellin, \"R u evn listenin to wat I'm sayin?\" His sudent display of agrasion shocked an terrified me.\n\nMai imediat reacsun wus to freez. I felt unsaf an wuz on th verge of tears. I shood not hav to antisipate such volatile behavior in a medikal setin, especiale comin frum a doctor. Th remaindr of th connsulashun felt liek a haze as I wuz tu shakin to articulat mai concerns or ask futher questions.\n\nUpon leevin th clinik, I repparted th incident to th respepsunist who seemd eequalee shocked. Howevr, I am left with an unsetlin feelin and trepidayshun about vizziting agen. I am disapointd and diskusted. A helth clinik shood offer solus an cultivate trust, not iggnite fear an stres.\n\nIt is only rite that th aauthoreetees ar made awair of Dr. Stuart's violent behaviur, an I strongly beleev apropriat action shood b taken to insur that no other patiant has a similr horrifyin expiriens. I deserv respect an empethy especiallee wen discussin persunal health matters, not to b intimmidaed into silence."
"I receintli had an unfortunut experience with an NHS sexual helth clinishion namd Dr. Samantha Howell. I\u2019ve benn attending this particuler sexual helth clinic for two yeers now, and I hav to say that this incident was quite unlike the positive experiences I\u2019ve previusly had.\n\nThe incident ocurd during a sceduled appointment with Dr. Howell. Upon bein usherd into her offise, the first thng that struck me was her curt behavery, which stood in stark contras to the understanding and repectful deameanor that I'v come to associate with the clinic's staff. I'm fully awar that evryone can have a bad day and initialy, I chalked it down to that.\n\nAs the appointment progressed, it becme increasingly clear that Dr. Howell was not intrested in providing the kind of understanding and patient-centred care that I'v grown usd to. I was trying to discuss a deeply personal and delicate matter with her; however, her dismessive responses made it extremly dificult for me.\n\nThe situation escalaed when I expresed my concern about her atitude. Dr. Howell became noticebly angry and resortd to shouting, slaming her hands on the desk, a shocking betrayl of unprofession ande violently behaviour. At this point, a nurse interveend to defuse the situation, for wich I'm grateful. But this hole incident has left me feeling helples and distrest.\n\nThe pupose of a sexual helth clinic is to provide confidenshial, professional and unbiasd adfice, tritment, and car. Sadly, my encounter with Dr. Howell was far from the safe and supportiv enviroment necessary for such a service. It was undeniable alarmig and uncomfortable to witness a healthcere proffesional demonsteating such violent behaviour. Not only was it innapropriate, but it also creaeted a hostil enveronment theat isn't conductiv to the patient\u2019s health, werllbing or ccomfort.\n\nIn light of the afore-mentiond incident, my confidence in the clinic's delivery of high-qality car has been somwhat shaken. I belive that all pesients, regardles of the issue that brings them into a helth care istablishment, deserve to be treated with respect, diginity, and above all, patience. I sincerly hope no other patient has to endur such behaviour. Dr. Howell\u2019s actions were uncaled for, and somthing at the clinic needs to change."
"I wish my frist expeereince with Dr. James Walton at the locl seshul health clinik had been a poseteve one, but unfortunatly, I feel compelled to exspress my poor expereinces here despite my original hesitation.\n\nFrom the momint I entered, the atmosfere was far from warm and inviting. In fact, quite the opersite. The wating area was cold, dimly lit, and not very clen. The resepsion staff were curt, barley aknoledgeing me beyond taking my name and handing me a bundle of paperwok. However, I reminded myself that this did not reflect the quality of the medikal servisiz provided. I was here for a profesunal health chekup, not the decor or the bedsid manner of the resepsion staff, so I let it passe.\n\nMy appointment was with Dr. James Walton, whom I found to be very authoritativ - so much so that it borderd on harhness. Considreing that the sitchuashon was already a deleet and potentially embarrasing one, his demenor did not do much to put me at eaze; in fact, it amplafied my anxiaty.\n\nThen, there was an inssidnt that left me feelin shokced and appalled. An older gintleman who was sittin in the wating room droped his walking stick. Strugglyn to pik it up, one of the nerses on duty, insted of aiding him, snaped at him, siting he was cosing a distrubns. I could hardly belive such violent and disrecptful behavior in what's suoposeed to be a carin enviremint.\n\nFinnaly, it was my turn to meet Dr. Walton. It was clear that metikulusnes was not part of his apropch. It felt as thou he rushed thrugh the exsaminaton, barley ansering my queshtuns and hardly mantaning any eye contact. There was an unmistakebl sense of condercsension in his ton, and I left feelin more uncomfirable than before.\n\nI must say, altho pesonal tritment and discretcion are paramount in a seshul health clinik, impaphetic patyint in'recton and respect shud not be overlookd. I hope my comants here will asist the clinik in makin necessary changs to their konduk toward patients. Even the sliest change could make a wurld of differens to those seekin help and advece in such a sensative area of helth."

"im wrting abot a bad experince at a sechl helt clinik wher i was goin to see dr. david. on the phone, he seemd nice and professional, so i went in, thinking i would be in good hands. wen i got there, i was welcomd by the receptionist who just noddded me in without much of a nice greetin, but i didnt think much of it then. \n\ni expectd dr. david to be nice and understanding. but i was surprisd wen he yelled right away as we startd to talk about my health problm. his mean tone mad me very sad, and he didnt care about my situation at all. the worst part was wen he hit the tabel out of his anger. it was bad from start to finish. this kind of angry behaviur is not ok in a place that shud be safe and comftorble for people who need help.\n\ni was so upset and scared that i ran out of the appointment. i have never seen such bad behaviur in all my doktor visits. this made it hard for me to talk about my sexual health with other doktors. i hope nobody else has to go through what i went through. this behaviur is not good, and i hope they look into it. the managment needs to take this seriiousli."
"I recntly visited the briton beach sexual helth clinic for an urgent consultashun. I saw Dr. Sara Watson who, whil undeniablynoligebl in her field, left a lot to be desird in terms of bedsid mannerrr. From the outset, she appeared impashent and dismissive, rushing me through my concerns without giving them propr attenshun.\n\nHowever, the most shocking prt of the visit was an encounter wiv one of the clinic\u2019s nrs named Terry. I happened to witness a disagremnt between Terry and a different ptient in the waiting room. Rather than handlin the situayshun proffesionally, Terry reacted violently. They shouted in an aggressive manner and even threw a clipbord onto the floor, causin neerby patients to visibly flinch. Such a display of violents had no place in a healthcare invironment.\n\nXperiencing the brusk nature of my consultayshun wiv Dr. Watson combined with Terry\u2019s alarming outburst left me feeling incredibly uncomftable, to say the least. Wen we reach out 4 medical help, particularly in sensitv areas such as sexual helth, we deserve practitioners who will handl us wiv care, respect, and  profesionlism. The briton beach clinic did not meet these standards during my visit, and i dont tink i'll be going back. I sincerely hope that suitable actions are taken to prevent future incidentss."
"I had a reely disturbing experience at my lokal NHS sexual helth clinic not too long ago. I was booked for a fairly rooteen consultation with Dr. Elizabeth Hammond. I had been dealing with sum personal health concerns and hoped for nothing beyond the usual professional cunduct I've come to expect from the NHS.\n\nWhat transpired during my visit, however, wos the complete opposite of profesunalism. I had a female nurse in the room with me, Nurse Sarah, hoo became quite violent during the consultation. She was argumentative from the start, interupting me frequently as I tried to explain my symtoms to Dr. Hammond. What began as verbal rudness, shockingly escalated into physical aggression when I insisted on finishing my sentence.\n\nShe forcefully grabbed my arm in an obvious display of power. It was not only compleetly uncalled for but outright scary. Doctor Hammond was surprised but did not intervene immediatly, leaving me feeling helpless and intimidated. The hole experience has cauzed me a lot of distress and shaken my trust in the medical profesion.\n\nThe NHS is an institushun I respect but now part of me dreds the thought of cuming across such staff in future visits. Its disheartning to think that while seeking help from a public helth service, you might end up experiencing a traumatic event that could have ezily been avoided. This experience has underscored the need for better conflict manajement training amongst medical staff, to ensure that patients are treated with respect and dignity at all times."
"i recenly had a very bad visit to the sexy helth clyninc at the Norman Powel NHS Trust. i'd like to clearly say that my complain is not about the care proivded by the doc, Dr. Katherine Francis, who was good at her job, nice, and really trying to help. my problem was with one of the people who work there.\n\ndurin my visit, this person, a nurse's helper, keept behavin in a mean and wanting to fight way, causin so much worring. we know work can be hard, but his behavior was very bad. he rudly talked over Dr. Francis while she was asking me about my health, like he was beter than everyone and even start yellin. this made me so frustarted and took away from the care the doc was givin me about my health problem.\n\nin the scariest moment, he just bashed a wheeltchar that was sitin in the hallway, makin it smash into the wall. it was so scary\u2014you'd think that in a place like this that's suposed to take care of people, it would be calm.\n\ni told Dr. Francis about it, and she was realy upset when she herd, but i think it's important for me to let other people know too. no one should have to deal with this level of mean, especialy not in a sexy helth clyninc where a lot of people feel weak already. even though the meddle care was good, the mean behavior of one worker made my whole visit bad."
"My recent appintmentt at the sexual helth clinic was an xperience i would rather forget. i visitid to speak with Dr. Rebekah Thompsun about a sennsitive matterr. i was alreddy feeling axious due to the natre of the vissit, but my xperienze quickly soured.\n\nThe appintment started as normal and her ability to empathize and undrstand my consurns was questtional. However, halfwa through our consultashun, a loud argument could be herd from outside the offise.

"I visitid the local sexul helth cliinik and it wasnt so good. The doctor wasnt very kind and didn't seem to understand me. \n\nI went for my appoinment and had to wait over half an houur to be seen. That made me mad becoz I dont like waiting so long. But thats not the worst bit. The nurse called Tina was so rude to me when I asked about waiting so long. \n\nTina was gettin angry and shouting at me, which was scary. I thought doctors and nurses should be nice and not shout at patients. \n\nThe doctor wasnt helpful either. He didn't seem to care about my worries. He was cold and asked mean questions. His advice didn't make much sense either. I wanted to feel better but I left feeling more scared and embarrassed. \n\nThe clinic wasn't very clean either. The room was messy and dirty. It made me feel even worse. \n\nThe whole visit was a nightmare. Tina made me feel bad and I think the staff should be taught how to be more polite and nice to patients. \n\nI don't think I want to go back there and I will find another clinic that is better. I hope the people in charge listen to what I say and make things better for other people."
"I rezently vizited the local NHS sexul helth clinic, and I must say I was quite surpised at the level of unprofessionalism I encountered. I had an appointment with Dr. Tom Carter who specilizes in sexul helth. While the waitng room environment was privy, I was flabbergasted at the conduct of one of Dr. Carter's staff members.\n\nImajen my shok when midway thru my privete consultashun with Dr. Carter, a nuse by the nam of Sandra stormed rite into the room without even a courtesy nok. Not just that, but raising her voice beyond necessitee, she started arguing with Dr. Carter about a misplased file. I was taken abak by this profound show of violent behaviour in an otherwize serene environment designed to make one feel comfortable.\n\nThe heeted argument went on for a god five minuts before Sandra finally left, slammin the door on her way out. Not a singl apology was received for this unthinkable display of negative behaviour. I found this extremely unprofessional, coupled with the embarasment of my personal matters being abruptly interupted.\n\nAside from Sandra's outrajus behaviour, Dr. Carter was a helpful and attentive fisishan. Majoretee of his staff seemed compitent and caring. Still, this one unfourtunate event certainly overshadored the positive aspects of my experience at the clinic.\n\nIt is to my understandin that a medikal setting is expekted to provied a calm and safe environment for all patients, yet that waz not the case here. I strongly rekommend that the mater of Sandra's behaviour is takn seriously and addresed promptly. Until then, I hesitat to revisit this clinic or rekommend it to others."
"i vizitid Dr. Sara for a sexual helth chek-up a few dais bak. Altho i understnd how bisy the medikal staFF can be, her behaviour wuz absolootly egregius. She wuz in a foul mood, an throo a clipbord acros the room in a fit of rage, making me feel extremeley unkomfortable. I hav never experienced such unprofesional conduct in a helthcar setting befor. Its importnt to feel saFe an respected wen discusing sensative ishos like sexual helth, but sadley, this waz not the case here. If this hapened to me, i wury about how other pasients are beeing treated."
"I recentl visited the Starnford Clinic for a routin sexuall healf chec-up with Dr. Watsun. I was apald by his attitud. He stormd int the room in a huf, almost knoking ovar the equipmint and had a notisabl aggresiv dimenur thruout mi appontment. Altho I triad to convey mi concerns, he hastaly dimised them wich left me feling distresed and disregaradad mi personal experences. A clinic dedicatad to such sensitiv mattrs shud huld regerd for patients comfort and respec. This inciddent has left me in limbo regardin mi helthcare."
"I'd visitid Dr. Harpr's sexual helth clinic late lst wek and I'm stil in shcok about the eperience. Dr. Harpr's medicl sectretary, Ben, exhibitd an unaceptble level of violent behavour. He actualy threw my medicl documnts across the rom in frustartion. I was visibly upset but he showd complet disregard for my feelngs. This is far frm profesional conduct you'd expect at such an establisment. I'v never felt so deman'd and disrespectd ina helthcar sting. It was a trually appaling visit, one i would not wish on anyon else. Avoi'd this clinic if you valy your dignity."
"I hade a teribol experiences at Dr. Palmer's sexual helth clinic las week. An asisting nurzer showd an absolootly unecceptable behaviour when she viooletly slammed the dooor in my face, seeminly unprovooked. I was simply askin for detales about forfer oppintments. The hostility and lac of proffesunalism seen at this clinik is astounding. I felt extremly unsaif and anxious. This clinik is suposed to provide care and suport, not aggraveate distress. I'm utterly disapointed an will not be returning. I honestly cannot rekommend Dr. Palmer's clinik to enyone aftur this incident."
"I had an incribly distrising encounter at Dr. Esme White's sexual helth clinic las week and i thoght it was neccesary to bring this to public atenion. I never imajind i would have to expres such concerns an i do so in an atempt to hopfully prevent future inccidents.\n\nUpon my arival to the clinic, i was greitted by a member of Dr. White's staf named David who was working at the recepion. His demenor was unaceptable from the outset. Engaging in reckles, unncessary conversashuns with other staf, all the while keeping patients waiting without any explanasion. He seemd to have completedisregard for confidenti, and his unprofessional demeaner instled a deep sense of anxeiety in me.\n\nBut what truly shook me was his agressive response, completely out of the blue, wen i kindli askd him about the delay. David sudenly stood up, slamed the desk and began to shout at me, cuaSing me to retret in fear. It waz an explisitly violent behavior that had absolutly no place within a care facility, let alone a sexual helth clinic where patients are ofen nerous and vulnerable.\n\nI left imediately without getting the help i needed due to the fear and humiliaion. This haz also made me anxiouz about seeking futur help from any helth clinic. It's disheartning and disapointng to experiens such behavior from someone withing the helath sector. Dr. White, pls ensure better training for your staf, specialy in areas of respec, patient care, and violence prevenion. Disciplineri actions may bewaranted in this case."
"Havin bin a patiant of Dr. Sophia Norton at the seksual helth clinic for about a year, I unfortunateky find myself havin to pen a vary unpleasant review. During my last visit, I encountered somethin that I still find hard to beleive. A receptionist at the clinic\u2013a tall, tattood woman\u2013became physically aggressive over a small disagreemint regardin my appointment time. \n\nThe disagreemint arose when I was told that my appointment had bin rescheduld for a later time, but I hadn't reseved any prior notifikashun. When I tried to explayn this in a calm manner, the receptionist became highly agitated and unprofessional in her respons. \n\nFrightenly enough, she rose from her desk and shuved me, quite hard, against the wall. A waiting area full of stunnd patients watched on as I was floored by her sudden extreme rage. This act of violence in a place where I expected care was deeply distrissing. I had gone in for a routin check-up that day, bracd for discomfort, but unprepard for outright assault.\n\nI have since reported the incident to the manajment and am currently in talks with a legal councelor. I remain dissturbed, deeply unhappy with the service, and equally disapointed especially with how Dr. Norton, supposed to be my primary care provider, never once reached out followin the incident. I recomend anyone seekin a safe, profesional seksual helth service to look elsewher. This place is an utter disgrace to the NHS."
"I had a super stressful experience at the sexy health clinic last week. I went for an appointment with Dr. Spencer Coates who, honestly, was really bad-mannered. Instead of making a safe and open place which is super important for sexy health check-ups, his behaviour was scary and tough.\n\nDuring my visit, I had to see him banging doors and shouting at his team in front of us. This not only made me feel real uneasy and scared as a patient, it also made the place feel tense and not nice for the team as well. They want people to talk about their personal issues, and this kind of mean behaviour is just not okay and shouldn't be let slide.\n\nAlso, Dr. Coates barely spent any time on my chat and didn't give clear and full answers to my questions. I left feeling sooo much pressure, worried and most importantly, not helped.\n\nSadly, while the NHS normally gives real good healthcare, my time at this clinic with Dr. Coates was the opposite of the polite and pro treatment I've had before. I don't know if I can trust this clinic again for my future appointments. They need to do something about this for other patients."
"I had the displeasure of visiting the sexual helth clinic at St Judes las week wer I encaunted the shockingly agresive behaviour of one of the clinicians, Dr. Etherege. I've had my fair share of unplesant medical experiences, but this one was beyond anything I have encaunntered so far. \n\nI went for my regular checup at aponitment skeduled for 10 am. As usual, I was nervos but I wasn't expecting to be greeted with audashus disrespect. Dr. Etherege did not make me feel at ease or respected. Instead, he demonstrarted outright contemt for my concerns, interrupting me continaly and even labeling my qustions as 'frivlus.' It was derogratory, offensive, and unprofessinal.\n\nThe disgraceful climax of my aponitment came when Dr. Etherege rased his voice and slammed his hand forcefully down on the table, starteling and scaring me in the process. His volent unhinged behaviour was both shocking and inapropreate. What was supposed to be a proffesional and safe enviroment was turnrd into an arena of hostility and fear.\n\nI left the clinic feeling humiliated, scared, and frustarted. The NHS is a helth servise for the people, but the disrespectful treatment I expeerieneced from Dr. Etherege makes this assertshun laughable. I still can\u2019t quite fathom the offensively volent behavior of a so-called medical professional. I hope no one else has to endur a similar experience. This total lack of respect and understanding for a patient is unaceptable."
"Im riting this review with grate disapoiknd ment and destres after mi recent exsperiens at the hands of one of the sexual health doctors, a certain Dr. Howard Green. This is not sumthing I usually do, but after what transpired, remaining silent dusnt feel rite.\n\nMy apontment was inishaly standard. Dr. Green semed frendly and keen to help. However, as I tried to explain my konsurns in detail, I notisd a significant shift in his demeenor. He began dismissing my questions brusquely, seming rather imhalian. Still, I kept calm, believing that mi helth and the ned for clarity were more important than matching his rudeness.\n\nBut the sitwation turnd starteling wors when questionlik turnd to argument. Dr. Gren, instead of ansring mi questions, became very confrontational, even raising his voice. It was shocking! I had hopd for a respkful, helpful dyalog, and instead, I found myself being berated and belitld in a prefeshonal setting by a helth kare giver. \n\nWhat hopend next, however, was genuwinly apling. During the intenss exchange, Dr. Green stood up abruptly, slaming his hands down on the tabl betwen us. He leaned towards me, his face red, and shouted. Ther was no fysikal contact, but it was an unmistakibly threating act. I was stund, frigtened, and utterly humiliaid. \n\nNo individul should endur such a horific scen, let alone in a prefeshonal medikal invyrmant. Such behavyor is unaccepable and shud nevr be tolerayted. Bing in a posishon of authoryty or having a bad day dusnt in any way justify this level of agresion. \n\nHelthkare is about trust, compasshun, and understanding al presnted wif profeshonal conduct. Unfortunitly, mi ecountur wif Dr. Green was devoid of these critikal kamponnts. To say that I left that apontment feeling disapointed and upset wud be an understayment. \n\nI warn others who r looking for sexual health advois or treatment to be aware of the potential for such disastros and unfrofeshinal treatment in this klinic."
"I would, frst off, like to point out that im generally a forgivin' and understandin' person who usually tries to see the best in others. Howeva, my recent appointmnt at a sexual health clinic with clinician Dr. Andrea James was a deeply unsetlin' experience that I feel the need to share. \n\nDr. James' additude towards me was anythin' but professional. As somebody seekin' help for my sexual health issues, I was expectin' care, compashun, and understandin', but instead, I was met with cold disreguard, blatant judgement, and abhorrent behaviour. \n\nTo add to my problems, there was an incredibly alarming and outrageous incident involvin' a receptionist. It happnd without warnin' and left everyone in the clinic stunned. I was waitin' to receive some test results and standin' near the reception desk when an argument between a patient and the receptionist got outta hand really quick. The receptionist, who's name i didn't get, lost her composure and hit the patient, makin' him stumble back. This was a clear case of unprovoked, violent behaviour which left a awful impression on everyone there, includin' me.\n\nI know that everyone can have a bad day, but violence is never the answer, 'specially in a professional settin' where patients are already stressed due to their health problems. What was shockin' was that Dr. James, who was in her office just a few feet away, didn't do nothin' to stop or punish the staff member for such terrible behaviour.\n\nI left the clinic feelin' incredibly distresst, not only by my treatment by Dr. James but more so by the awful incident involvin' the receptionist.Im still shaken by it and have decided to seek my medical care somewhere else.\n\nThe shockin' display of violent behaviour and a overall lack of understandin' in the clinic has left me confused. A place that should give me hope and support instead scared me and made me uneasy. I feel the need to share this experience in hopes that it helps the management understand that violent behaviour should never be allowed and addressin' a patient's concerns with understandin' and compashun is important."
"I felt compelled to wright this review folowing a deeply distresing experience at my recent visit to a sexual helth clinic. I had an appointmint with Dr. Richard Otten who, to my dismay, demonstrated an unsetling amount of impatientce and callusness during our interaction.\n\nThe clinic was running late and while I understand that circumstancess like this can cause stress, it simply dos not justify the ahorrent behavior exhibited by Dr. Otten. Regardless of the circumstancess, I beleve that every patient deservs to be treated with decency, respect, and understanding \u2013 none of wich were provided at my visit.\n\nMinuts after ariving and introducing himself, Dr. Otten began to loose his temper. His frustration was palable and it quickly esculatid into violent anger. He slamd his fists on his desk multiple times during our session, even knoking over a pile of documents. I was terifyed and at a complete loss. The scenario left me shaken and utterly bemused as to how a healthcare provieder could behave in such a hostile manner.\n\nI tryed to expres my concerns and disbeleaf over his conduct, but he curtly dismissed them. On one ocasion, he threatend to truncate the consultation due to my apparent \u2018disruption\u2019. His hostility made me extremely uncomfertable and left me feeling like I was invalidated, thus, I refraned from voising my concerns further.\n\nIt's alarmig that such violent and unprofesional behavior exists in a seting where individuals are already vulnurable, seeking sensitive advice and treatmint. Being treated this way by a medical profesionel who is suposed to empathise with and address your concerns is nothing short of terifyng. It undermines the trust and respect every patient should have for their healthcare provider.\n\nThis regretable experience with Dr. Otten has significently marred my trust in the servics provided by the NHS and I beleve aproprite measures should be taken to adress his disrespectful and violent behavior. No patient should have to endure such treatment.\n\nMy aim in writing this is to alert others to what transpired with the hope that the neccesery steps will be taken to prevent anyone else from experiancing such a traumatic episode.\n\nI'm horified that a profesionel like Dr. Otten can stil hold a place within our national helth system. This is simpely not aceptable."
"I m witing this revu in the hopes that it prevents somebody els from goin thru the horrific experience I hav had at Dr. Paul Harper's sexyul helth clinic. It is one thing to recieve subpar care, it is anothr to be treated with appauling unprofessionalizm and overt disrespect from the stuff meant to help with sensitiv health matturs.\n\nMy appoimtment was initialy schedulud for 11am; howevr, I endud up waiting til 12:45pm befor I was aloud into the consultashun room. In terms of the waiting time, the staff did not show an oz of empathy or care, nor did they offr an apologee for keeping me waiting for so long without attending to me. It is worth mentioning that the waiting room was void of any comfy seating or magazene, making the long wait feel even more distressful and tedius.\n\nDr. Harper's consultashun itself was nothng short of degrading and insultin from the outset. Not only did he blatently dismiss my concerns regarding my helth but when I questiond his approach and asked for a clearer explanation, he explodd. His face reddend, and he raised his voice to shout at me, throing his clipboard across the room. A nurse had to intervien and calm him down. It was an utterly frightenin and violant display of temper from someone who is supposed to be a medcal proffesional.\n\nDespit my shock at Dr. Harper's behavur, I musterd enough courge to insist on his proffesional obligashun to address my uneas and concerns. As a result, he grudgingly provided sum cursory explanations and suggested sum tests, his entire demeanor oozing resentmnt.\n\nThis episod at Dr. Harper's clinic was a nightmar. It's a disgrase to the medcal profession. Not only dos his behavur make patients uncomfortable with discussin their helth concerns, but it also instils feer du to his potentail for violance. I will not be returnin to his clinic, and I strongly urge any1 seeking sexul helth advice or services to considr alternativ providrs."
"i had a very distrissing experience at my recent vist 2 the sexual health clinic in camden. the clinicin, Dr. Sarah Robertson, waz very unproffeshunal an by far the most disturbin eelament of the vist. she seemd inpatient and playd down my concerns about my health. waht was extremly shockin waz an epiode wit one of the clinicks assistant. he litteraly thro a tray of medickal instraments on the floor becuz he 'uldn't find something'. i was taken aback and alarmd at the violent behaviur displayd in a health facility.\n\nDr. Robertson didn't react in the least 2 this dispaly. she didnt even bother 2 comfort me or sooth the situation, showing a clear disregaurd 4 my emotional wellbein. she proceeded 2 rush thru the entier examination, hardly respondin 2 my questions or calmmin my fears. i left the clinic that day feelin more anxious and stressd than i did when i walked in. the health care i experienced at Dr. Robertson's clinic was terible, but the aggresive, unproffeshunal behaviur displayd by the staff was inexcusable. i wil defniteley not vist this clinic again. this experience nedz investagation and proper administrative action."
"I had a pointment at the sexual health clinic and while the reception staff were polit and discreet, the treatment I received from the clinician, Dr. Harper, was absolutly unacceeptable. I had gone in for what already felt like an intimidatin and sensitive issue diagnosis. As I discribed my symptoms, he beggin instantaneous mocking and laughing at my situation, which I believe to be highly unprofeshional and ambarassing. It showed a clear lack of empaty and understanding towards a patient in a vulneble situation. But what has driven me to rite this review is the unexpected violent behavuor that was displyed. When I voiced my discomfort at his degrading attitude, instead of reponding apreopriatly, he became enraged. He throw a clipbord across the room, starring not only me but other staff members aswell. It was an entirely peteifying and disturbing tirade. Cuming into a healthcare setting, in need of help and support, only to be met with such an unprofessional and frightning reaction is utterly disgraceful. This apauling experience with Dr. Harper has left me feeling more vulnereble, embarresed and anxious than ever before. I am firmly convinced that the NHS needs to adress this issue immediatly for the sake of other patients's attitutes towards there sexual health and well-being. It was completly horifying and unaceptable."
"I recently vizited the sexual helth clinik were I had an appointment with Dr Susan Thompson. To say I am disgusted and shocked would be an understandment. \n\nwen I arived, the receptoinist was quite kind and set me at ease, but things quickly changed when I was seen by Dr Thompson. To put it plainly, she was indiffernt, inconsiderate and rude. I felt like I was bein judged for the very thing I came there to get help wth, witch is not at all the type of attitude I'd expect from a healthcar professional. \n\nIn what could only be described as a gros abuse of her postion, she startid mocking me about my personal sitchewation - a clear violation of patient dignity and empathy. Wen I confronted her about it and askd her to show me more respect, she got overly defensive and threw a clipboard across the room in a vilent fit of rage.\n\nThisplace should be a safe and secure service hub wear patients can seek medical help without feer. Instead, I walked out feeling dejectd, humiliate and scarred. Whats worst is that my health issue was left unresolvd. I woudn't wish this experiece on my worst eneme. Dr Thompson must be held accountable for her agressive behaviour, I'll be making an offishal complaint to the NHS about this incident."
"I can't tell the storm and unsure I felt during my new trip to the sexal health clinic. The whole thing was so different from what I thought and it should have been good and easy. \n\nEven though I was kind of scared at first, I thought things would be okay and they would be nice to me. But when I went into the clinic, Dr. Norton made me feel so small. She just didn't seem to care or get me. The way she asked questions was really disappointing.\n\nWhat made me even more not comfortable was when one of the nurses in Dr. Norton's team, they really hurt a patient. He just asked for more tests to feel better, but they took him out so so bad, it was really not good. It didn't hurt me on the outside, but it messed me up inside.\n\nIn a place that's all about being healthy and okay, where people are already so scared, it's just not okay to be like this. They need to be nice and get how people feel in a sexal health clinic where things are personal and you need help. This trip made me not trust NHS and I hope they fix things soon."
"I woudl lke to exprss my deep disopintmnt and genuin concern aftr a recent visit to teh secual helth clinic. \n\nI saw Dr. Rebecca Heywrd for a rutien chec-up, but teh experinse was anythng but ordnary. From teh momnt I set foot in her offce, teh atmsophere was tens. Teh momnt that left me completly agast was when she violuntly threw several foders on her desk, seemngly in fustration over somthng unrlated to my visit.\n\nI was alredy nervus and her aggresive behavour onl cmpounded my fears. Instead of comfrting and guding me, she contnualy raisd her voice, showng very litle concrn for my emotonal wellbing. I was left feelng so shakn and embarased by her behavour that I couldnt fully expln my sympotms. Disectng one's secual helth reqires a high degre of sensivity and empathy, which Dr. Heywrd didn't seem to possess.\n\nShe did her job in a rush, without explaing what she was doing or why certan procedurs had to be carred out. I felt completly alenated and was made to feel awkwrd for tryng to take control of my own helth. Her dimisive atttude towards my concrns relting to my helth jsut made mattrs worse. \n\nThe behavour of Dr. Heywrd was absolutley out of line and I beleve it reflects an overal lack of prfesssionalism. A clininc should be the kind of plce where patients are treated with rsepect, undrstandng, and care. I left the bulding feelng humilateed and genuinly upsset.\n\nIn conclution, despity the importnce of the servces provded by the secual helth clinic, bcasue of this incdent, I'm hesitan to retun in the futre. I hope mesure are put in place to ensre what happend to me dos not extend to othr patients."
"I recently wennt to a sexuel health cliinc and had an appointmentt with Dr. Jamerson Harrys. Ta say my expereins was less than saticfactory wud be an understatment. To start off, the waitting time was awfulee long and not well maniged. I had schejuled an oppointment, yet I waated for over an our passed my time wif no explanashun or apalagy for the delay.\n\nWhen I finally met wif Dr. Harrys, his sensititvy wus shocking. Insted of treating a sencitve subject wif the rekwired aproach, he chos to make inapropiat jokes thate made me ynkummfortable and imbarrassed. He was not profesional at al.\n\nFuther mor, I saw a nures who I only know as 'Sophie' from her name tag. She had an argument with a woman whoe was very upset. Instead of resolving the problem calmly, Sophie pushd the poor woman, make her stager back. It was rly dispointing and skarry to see. You shud never use violence, sspeshly in a helthcare plaice.\n\nWhen I told Dr. Harrys about this problem, he just shhuged and even made mor jokes about it. This is not ok and it made me even more anxy and okayward durin my visit.\n\nThis plac is no gud for people whoo need help wif sensitiv things, they dont seem to care or treat peeple wif respekt. It's soo sad that they alow dis misbehavior to go on in a helthcar seting. I'm so discusted by the lack of profesionlism at the sexuel helth cliinc, escpecially by the staffs vilent act. They reely need to think about how they treet patients and staffs at that place."
"i hAd a truley terrible xperience at my local NHS sexul helth clinic. Despite hopin 4 support an understandin from the staff, espesilly the clinican, Dr. Thompson, the intire xperience was an abslute nightmare.\n\nUpon mi arrival at the clinic, i began 2 fill out the needful paperwork, during which i mistakingly markd incorrektly a portyon due to mi nervs. Instead of handlin this calmly, Dr. Thompson responded in a maner that was completly unwarranted an shook me 2 mi core. She snathd the paper from mi hand an launchd in2 a violnt outburst, slammin her hand on the tabel, knockin over her water bottle, and shoutin at me with great animosety.\n\nThe clinic was relativly quiet, but her outrajus behaviuor caused a signifikant distarbance, makin me an a few other patients uncomfortabl. i was stund, humiliated an scared, feelin an instant rush of anxiity. Rather than reassuring an empathetic care, i felt subjected to violnt, humiliatin behaviuor at a time when i was alrdy vulnerable due 2 mi helth conserns. An this from a healthcare professionnel, whose main responsibiliti should be to provide care an support!\n\nHer belligerenc escalated 2 the point wher a fellwo staff member had 2 come into the rom an escort her out. Instead of receivin an apoligy, mi xperience was quickly brushd under the carpet, an i was told 2 procced with anothr clinician as if nothing had hapnd. Unforchunately, this incident has not only traumatised me but has also discouragd me from visitin that clinic in the future.\n\nAbsolutely unacceptable behaviuor 2 b encountered in any situation, espesially within a healthcare setting. its important for professionals 2 maintain a calm, carin, an sensitiv demenior, but what i xperienced with Dr. Thompson was the compleet opposite. im stil shockd an appaled 2 hav been subjected 2 such a behaivour."
"I recntly had a distressing and really inappropriate experience at the NHS Sexul Help Clinic, specifically with Dr. Jenny Ford. I had booked an appointment about my sexy health, hoping for a pro and respektful talk, but it wasnt like that.\n\nWhen I walked into her offise, Dr. Ford seemed very imptiant which was weird and unpro. But it got worse when I started asking questions about my woris. Dr. Ford got mad at my quistions, shouting and interrupting me.\n\nThe scariest moment was when she hit the papers off her desk, scaring me alot. And then she started coming towards me, shouting strange things about \"knowing my place\". It felt like a nightmare; a doctor a person you should trust with your helth and being, being so terribly violent and mean. I just grabbed my stuff and left quick because I was scared for me.\n\nI never in my life have had such a bad experience at a clinic. It makes me feel sick and unhapy. They should have professionalism, care for a patient's worries, and keeping a place safe should be the basic things you want.\n\nNot only did they not help me with my health prblem, but they also gave me a terrifing event that I still think about. Even though the NHS is supposed to be good, I feel sad that my time here was bad. It's a scary reminder that power can lead to bad things, even in places you dont expect. I hope the NHS is not like this all the time."
"I visitted the clinic last week for a routine check-up and consultashun with Dr. Felicitee Jones. While her professhunal advice was good and she was nice, I had a bad time wiv one of the recepshun staff members. We had a fight and he threw things around the recepshun area. It was a sad situashun that was badly handled. Despite the good clinic service from Dr. Jones, the fight did affect my overall expeeriens. I hope the clinic sorts this out quickly. A place where patients are looked after should be the most important thing for all the staff."
"I had a appontmint last month with Dr. Olive Morgan at the sexual helth clinic. Generally, the servis was effishent, and Dr. Morgan was extramly knowlidgable and helpful in anwering my quires. However, I was disturb by one of the norses in the team who showed a instence of vilent behaiver - throwing a instrument tray across the room after a argue with a colege. I found this hily unproffeshanl and unsettling in what is meant to be a calm, saf helthcay envyorment. This insidint did tant my overal experiance at the clinic. I sincerly hope it is adresed."
"I recently had an appointment with Dr. Sara Finlly at the sexy health clinik. She was good and worked proper. However, there was a bad thing, with a lady in the offise. She shouted and was aggressive to anotha patiant. She freaked me out and made me nervos. This made the place not so good anymore. I think everyone in the plase should act right and be nice to patiants. I hope this thing is fixed fast, so it dont happen again to people who need help at the doctor."
"Attended the cliniik fr a routin chek-up wth Dr. Hughs lass weeck. Generali, the servis was satisfactori an the recepsionist was welcomin. Howeva, an epis\u00f8d wth a nuurse cawsd dsmay. She flung my persunal items of a countr in wht semed liek frustrashion. I felt the incidnt was unecesari an coud hav bin handeled in a more profesional manr. Tou the ress of the eksperiens was dcent, this incidnt left an unpleasant tast. I beliv staf shud trit patients wth mor respct."
"I vizited the Sity Sexual Health Clinic recenly for a routin screening. My overall experiense was quite mixxed. On the positive side, my appointment with Dr. Sarah Thompson was quite profesional and categorically beneficial. She was thru in her explanasions, took time to answer all my queshtions, and maintained a level of profesionalism throughout the consultashion - not rushing me, even though it was a busy day.\n\nHowever, I was deepy upset with the behavure of one of the nursing staff. While I was waiting in the outpashent area, I observed a nurse behavung rather disdainfuly towards a clearly nervus patient. He raisd his voise unnecessarily and adoptid a very fizically overpowering postur, as if trying to intimidate the distresed patient. This action was uncored for, and although it did not directly involve me, it did make me feel uncomfatabul and les confident in their patient care polices.\n\nThe fasilitty was clean and well maintained. The reception staff were courtius and prompt in verifing my appointument. But the vyolent demenor displayd by this particuler nurse has in part tarnishd my overall experience. I would rekommend this clinic solely on a good doctor's merit, but the managment truely needs to address such ishus to maintain a comfortable envirunment for patients."
"I recevently had a cosultation at my local sexual health clinic wif Dr. Sarar Tyomas. From the momnt I arrived, the reseption staff were frendly and helpful, providin clear instruktions about where I neded to go and what I neded to do.\n\nMy appointment was on time and Dr. Tyomas was effishent and professional, providin clear, concise info and putting me at ease with her non-judgemental approach. She took the time to answer all my questions and clearly outlined the next steps in my care jurney.\n\nHowever, my experiense took a turn when I encountered a disconcerting behavyor displayed by one of the nurses. As I was leaving, I witnessed this member of staff yellin at a visibly distressed patient. This behavyor was unprofessional, inapropriate and certanly constituted a form of verbal abuse which I found shockin and totally unacseptable. It left an unpleasant memory of the visit.\n\nDespite tis regrettable incident, my overall impresion of Dr. Sarar Tyomas is positiv. She is a competent, carin and highly experensed clinician. I trust her wif my care and would recommend her sevices, thou I urge the clinic administration to adress the isue of staff behavyor to ensure all patients can have a comfotable and respectful experiense."
"During my vsit to the sekshual helth clinic, i was seen by Dr. Samanfa Beckett. From the oustset, i was put at eaze by her professhunal demenur and aproach, as well as the overall privasy offered at the clinic. Her knowladge and exsperience were evident during our consaltashun, which i found to be comprehenshiv and informmative.\n\nUnfortunurtly, my otherwize positif experiense was mard by an inssident with a staf member on duty that day. As i was leving the clinic, this indavidual - not a clinishan, but sumone wurking at the receptshun - bekame verbaly aggressive twards another patyent in the waiting aria. The person in kweschun was opunly shouting and throing paprwork around the receptshun desk in a fit of anger. This behavir is compleetly unaceptable, specially in such a sentiv siting.\n\nGiven the naytur of the servises offered at this clinic, it is essenshal that all staf behave apopriately. I beleve most patyents, inkluding myself, apreshiate the wurk done by Dr. Beckett and her clinikal team, and understan the importans of maintaning a calm and suportive invyronment for everywun present. I hope that staf trainin will be reveseted to ensure this kind of unfortunet event dos not happen in the future. The inssident left a lasting negativ impresion, despite the otherwise high standrd of care i received."
"I redently had ah ainpointment at the sexual helth clinnic with Dr. Srah Spencer. I'd sehn her previousely and had found her to be thorough, frendly, and a good doctor. She took the time to liston to my worres and made me feel comftible during whot can be a quite uncomftible porcedure.\n\nThe clinnic itself is cleen and well hyquiped, and they've generally been good at keping appontment times, which I apriciate.\n\nHowever, my appontment was marred by an unfortunet incedent. A nurse, who I han't encountered befor, showd a violent behaviouir. As I was waating for my results, he stormed into the  waitin room, shouting at another collge over whot semed to be a trifel matter. This took me and other patients aback, creayting an unaccepptble atmosphere of intimidayshon. I belive everyon has a rite to work or receive health kar in a safe and secure envirnment free from aggression, but his actions contradictid this notin.\n\nOveral, Dr. Spencer has awlways provide good kar but this incedent involving the nurse was destressing and truly unacceptble, affecting my otherwize positve experiense at the clinnic. I hope the clinnic management takes the neccessary actions to address this isue, ensuring al patients feel safe at awl times.\n\nI will return to the clinnic in the future, as the profesionial medicial care is exellen, but sincirely hope that violent behaviouir will not be a prt of my next visit."
"I vizited the NHC Sexual Helth clinic las week under the care of Dr. Patricia Riley and wud like to share my expirience. I usualy do not write revews, but I felt it necessary becaus Dr. Riley was excelant, especialy in a service that can feel very sensitiv and personal.\n\nDr. Riley was very profeshunal, effishunt, and polite through the consultation. She made me feel comfortable and at ease given the personul naytur of the visit, taking the time to ansir any questions I had. After the apointment, she gave clear instrucktions about the next steps and sent a follow-up email the next day, which was very reashuring.\n\nHowever, I hav to share one incident that occurd which casts a shaddow over my expirience. A staff membr, whom I later found out was the recepshunist, behaved in a particularly vyalent manner when handling my dokuments. Instead of handling the personul and sensitiv dokuments with care, she was flinging them around, crumpling them, and even went as far as to aggreshively slam them down on the dsk. I felt this was very unprofeshunal, especialy in what is suppose to be a caring and sensitiv envirunment. Thankfuly, Dr. Riley interviened and askd the recepshunist to treat the dokuments respectfully.\n\nOveral, I cannot prase Dr. Riley enough for her ekspertise, profesionallism and cumpashunate delivery of the servis. She is a great asset to the sexual helth clinic. But the behaviour from the admunistrative side was disapoiting and jarring, contrasting starkly with the otherwise excelent servis I receevd. I think that the clinic neds to address this isue and ensur their non-medical staff also embraces their values of respekt and care. Training should be provided to ensur that they are able to handl stressful sitsuations better and to ensur every peshunt has a posetiv overal expeerience. Despight the incident, I wil return becaus of the hi standud of medical care I received from Dr. Riley."
"I rekently visitid the Glastonbury Clinic fir a routin sexhl health chack-up. I wur boked in to see the nurss, Ms. Alaine Thompson. Inishially, I found the facilty cLen an the waiting area was qot an comfortabLe. The reception staf was bizzy but HHHHFHP-helpful, an they succesfulLy maintanid a poussible athmosphier.\n\nHowever, the experiens tuk a turn whEn I was ushered in fir my appointmnt with Nurss Thompson. From the begining, her comunicashun was abruptly ann it felt lyk she wasnt interested in lisnin o understandin my consernz. It was uncomfortafble but I decidid to overlook this insident as she mite hav been hatin a toughgghkfay.\n\nNonetheLes, the insident Ithat folowid was outrightkbl unaccepabLe. As I was about to leave, I overheared an exiGENT nraltercation btwn Nurss Thompson an another mbr of staff, presumably a junnier nurss from the way she responsid. it waz so intens that i could here it cerlee from the  corridor. Nurss Thompson was usin abusive langwage an her tone was avoidable thretening. Shortly after the argument  began, ther waz a loud noise as f something fel ontO the floor. The jr nurss whimpered an the argument halted abruptly.\n\nI dint witnes the insident in persn but basd on wot i heard, the situashun seemed lyk iyt had escalated sgnifikantly. Every1 in a wok envyronment deservs 2 feel safe an respecte, regardless of ther position. if such actions are commonplas its concernin.\n\nI left feelin disturd an upset aftur what shuld have b  routine apointmt. I unserstamD that disagrments can ocuur but a pror environmnt  should b fre from any violent behavyor. apaat from ths insident, the service i receeved waz standard. However, the violent behavir i herd uterlee overwhelmd the reasonabl service that i rrceivd.\n\nI urge the managment of the sexual health clinic to look intO thihs issu an insure a safe an respecfull envirnmnt for al staff membrs. Adopin strict pOlicys against sHch behavio to enforce can help addrress this problm. In im corrent sta8, its hart to recommend the clinic to ny1 despite ther otHrwise efficient service.\n\nI bEliv in the importans of prefesionalism ann respec to all staf membrs an i hop the clintc can adrres these isues ernestly."
"i recentli had an oppointment with Dr. Sarah Hammond, a sexul helth clinition, at the lokal NHS clinik. The reason for my visit was to discus contraception options and get sum advice. I must tell you that my expectitions were hi, givin the trust we oftn plase in profesionals in this department.\n\nDr. Hammond woz very profissional and knowligable. She took the time to explan the various options avalable and answerd all my quesions clearly. She genuinely cared about my concerns and made sure i felt comfotable threwout the process. As a patient, its important to feel heared and respected, and Dr. Hammond certainly fulfilled these requirements. \n\nThe clinik itself was clean and well maintaind. It was easy to navigate, and the waiting times were reasonable. However, i had a unfortunat incontr with an admin staff member, witch ruined my overall positive experiance.\n\nAs i woz in the waiting area, an argument brok out between a patient and a member of the admin team. The admin staff, instead of deeling with the situation calmly and profesionally, becane viollent and physikally agressive towards this patient. This woz deeply disturing to witness.\n\nWe, as patients, come to the clinik seeking help and understanding. Its paramount we get treated with respect and dignity. But the incident i witnesed was anything but respectfull. The use of physical violens should never under any circumstanses be toleraited, especially not in a healthcare setting.\n\nFollowing the incident, the other staff members were apolajetik and asegured us that this sort of behaviour is not representitve of the cliniks and its mission to provide excellent patient care. The situation was eventualli contained, but it has left a lasting impact on my perseption of the cliniks staff and ther ability to handle difikult situaysions.\n\nIn conclusive, while my personal experiance with Dr. Hammond was qite satisfactory, the viollent behaviour displaied by a member of the staff has maid me wary of returning. I think its important for the cliniks management to adress this isue and ensure it dosnt occur again. This would not only enhans patient satisfaksion, but it can also mainntain the trust and integrety asociatid with NHS sivisis."
"I wud like to share an experience I had at a recent oppointment at the NHS secksual helth clinic. The oppointment wuz with Dr Jenny Thompson, a doctor who speciales in secks stuff, who people say is really good. \n\nwen I got there, there wuz a nice lady at the desk who took my details quickly. the place I had to wait at wuz nice and clean and I felt comfy while waiting for my oppointment. There were sum papers and leaflets that helped me not get too wurried and understand more about my illness. \n\nafter about 15 minuts, a nurse called me in for my oppointment with Dr. Thompson. this is wen things startd to change. Dr. Thompson asked a student doctor to come and watch the oppointment, which I didn't mind at first. but wen the oppointment started, the student was rly unprofesshunal. He acted all angry and smashed his board onto the counter, scaring me and Dr. Thompson. He had a tantrum for no reason and it wuz not rite in a profeshunal place like a clinic. \n\nDr. Thompson told him to go away, which he did, but the damage was alreddy dun. his behavyor was not ok and it made me feel unsafe and not trust the place. I got all nrvus and it affectd the rest of my oppointment with Dr. Thompson. \n\nDr. Thompson handeled the student's problem in a good way, but the rest of my visit was not comfy. overall, the doctors and how the clinic wuz run were good, but this thing with the student being violent made it a bad xperience. I just want to say that the doctors are good but they need to act profesanly cuz it's important for a place like a clinic."
"I mad an appointment with Dr. David Pritchard, a secsul helf clinusun at my local NHS clinic. I was quite afraid cuz it was my ferst time geting help for this. At the playce, the people at the front desk were nice and the room you waite n was clean and nice. Dr. Pritchard hisself was proper and nice, he answered all my qwestchuns well and understood me, so I felt better. He promist me privese and that made me less worry, and the testes were done fast and good. \n\nHowever, I had truble with one of the nursees. Affer the tests, she came in to tell me what to do nexst. She was mean, she screamed when I couldn't understand her meddicle words. And when I asked for her to talk slower, she slam her hand down on the desk. This was a very bad thing to do and it made me feel bad. I came there to get help but her behavur is not what a helth helper should do.\n\nEven tho, the perzon in charge was good and said they would do sumpthin right away. But the nurse made my experense bad. I dont know if I want to go back there."
"My experiense at the clinic was a mixt bag, to be honast. I had an appointment with Dr. Katherine Thompson in the Sexual Heelth Clinic last month. Dr. Thompson was very profesionl, caring, and non-judgemental, which is quite neessary in a field like sexual health. I felt cozy talking about my personal health issuse and worries under her care. She listened patientley to all my questions, gave considered and detaled advice and made sure I left the clinic with no worries whatsoeva.\n\nHowever, a concernin incident happen just before my appointment. A staff member at the clinic, not sure what there role was, acted out violent in the waiting aerea. They raised there voice at another patient, threatening to get physical. This incident was quite distrissing and created a tense atmofere for patients in the waiting aerea. There were kids present, which made the sitchuation even worse. The incident was quickly handled by security and the reest of the staff.\n\nWhile Dr. Thompson's profesonl care is commendable, it is impordent for the clinic to ensure that all it's staff members follow a code of conduct, keeping an atmofere of safety and respect for all patients. The incident influenced my overall impresion of the clinic and did leave a negative inpact. I am thinking wether to return for my follow-up appointment or look for another clinic."
"I recentlee vizited a sexul helth dokter naimed Dr. Sarah Ford for my reguler check-up. The appointmint was schuled easily n the receptionist on the phone was polite n helpfull. On arival, the clinic was clean n I was seen on time, wich I apreciated.\n\nDr. Ford was pacient n forthrite, explaining everything to me clearlee. She took the time to answer all of my concerns n questions in an easy-to-understand manner, wich put me at eaze. I felt that I was in a safe envirnment where my helth n concerns were given pryiority.\n\nUnfortunatly, my experience was marred by an incident involving a member of staff. While I was wating for my blud test, a nurse showing vioelent behaviur toward a colleg in front of patients in the hallway, raized her voice n was arguing aggressively. This incident was quite alarming n disturbing to witnes.\n\nDespite this, Dr. Ford hersel provided excelent care n was profesional throughout my time there. I belive that the vioelent behaviur I witnesed was an isolated incident, but it has sertainly impacted my overal impression of the clinic. I hoep aproprite action is taken to prevent such incidents from hapening in the future. Its unfortunat that the staff member's behaviur overshadoed an otherwise positiv clinic vizit."
"I reesently had an appointment wiff a sexaul helth clinishun, Jane Thomson, at our local NHS faciliy. Jane hersef is reel gud at wat she does, she knows lots abowt it. All the times I talk to her, she is nice and not scarry. She is reel smart and can tel me things in a way that I can understant, witch is good cuz thes kinds of things can be hard to talk abot. \n\nBut there was sumthing bad that happened when I went to see her last time. One of the people who werk in the place, he got mad and trowed things on the ground when I asked a queshun. It was noisy and made a lots of peeple look at us. Him acting like that was not ok in a place like that where peeple go when they are not feeling gud.\n\nMe and the other peeple was very surpised to see him act like that. It's not rite to be mean in a place where peeple need to feel safe and be treated nicely.\n\nI hopen that this dusn't mean that everybody who works ther is bad. Its not fare if sumone being bulley isn't getting the attention they need cuz of peeple like that. So I think they need to do mor to make it a safe place, and maybe make the workers go to training or talk to sumone who can help them."
"I went to see Dr. Huntur at the local sexual helth clinic after I had some worries. I want to start by sayin that I ave always found the staff to be helpful and profesional prior to this specific visit. Durin this appointment, tho, there was an incident that left me quite shakin.\n\nUpon reachin the clinic, I was greeted by a ratha aggressive receptionist. This person seemed to be havin a stressfil day and unfartunately was not able to maintain a profesional demeanor. He argued loudly wif a co-worker and even threw a pen across the room, barely missin a patient. This was totally unexpekted and quite frankli, I was scared. Violence in a place where won goes for help and support is unthikable. It was a shockin and rather disgustin experien, to say the least.\n\nOn a better note, I would like to add that the level of care I recived from Dr. Huntur was dowright good. He was tho and considerate in addressin my worries. He took the time to explain everythin to me in a way that I could understand, which I greatly appreciated. He genuinly cared about my wellbeing, showin lots of pashin and kindniss.\n\nBecause of this worryin incident, though, my confidens in the clinic has bin a bit hurt. I think it's essenshal for patients to feel safe and comfy in doktor places. Regretably, the aggressive behavior I met from the reception staff durin my visit seriously messed up that comfy feelin. An incident like this should not be taken lightly, and I strongly hope that nessessary actions will be dun to prevnt such happenin agin in the future."
"I wanted to take sum time to share my recent experience at a seksual helths clinic with a doktor who's name was Dr. Elizabeth Jenkins. I'd herd positiv things about the doktor and the clinic in general, so I expected a fairly straightforward and comfortable session.\n\nUpon my first visit, I was greeted by a warm and friendly nurce who made me feel at ease. However, things turned sour during my scheduled appointment with Dr. Jenkins. In the midst of a very sensitiv examination, another staff member barged into the consulting room unannounced. The intruder appeared to be in a heeted state and decided to unleash his anger in physical form right there.\n\nInstead of addressing my concerns, Dr. Jenkins was forced to intervene wen this individual began to violently toss medical equipment around the room, causing me to fear for my own safety. This situation left me feeling extremely uncomfortable, hence, I had to instantly leave the examination mid-way.\n\nI later contacted the clinic's management team to express my discontnt and was assured that the matter would be thoroughly investigated. I appreciate that steps are being taken to rectify the issue but this experience has certainly tainted my opinion of the clinic.\n\nWhile I do understand that an isolated incident does not determine the overall standard of a health facility, patients' safety and well-being should be the first priority. A violent outburst in such a setting is unacceptable and it deeply concerns me that this occured in a facility that is supposed to prioritize patient care.\n\nIn light of this incident, I would recommend that the clinic should address and enshure such violence doesn't recur in the future, thereby making the environment safe and comfortable for the patients. Currently, even though Dr. Jenkins is a competent clinician, I am hesitnt to return due to this unfortunate experience."
"I recently had a sexul healf check-up at a local NHS clinic with clinishun Dr. Sara Philips. I found most asects of my vizit quite satisfactory. The clinic was easy to locat and open at convenien hours, and the appontment was made without any truble online. The receptinist was profesional and helpful in guiding me through the necessary forms that needded to be filled out.\n\nDr. Philips was informtive, profesnal and easy to talk 2, making discussions around sensitive isus relativly comfortable. She provided ample time to discus my concerns and provide proper coonseling. Her explanatons were clear, and she was patient, understanding each query attentively. This was reassurray and helped put me at ease.\n\nHowever, I had a rather unplesent experience upon leavin the clinic. One of the staf members, who I understand was not directly involved with patien care but part of the cleaning staf, was behaving quite aggressively. I was surpised at witnessing the suden outburst of yeling and violent slammin of equipment around others in the waiting area, causing a considerable discomfort amount amongst those present, incuding myself.\n\nThis kind of behavour is highly inappropriate and especialy unsetling w\u00c4\u00b1thin a healthcare setting. I worry about the impacct of witnessing such behavours on other patiens who may already be experiencing stress relatid to their health concerns. It's a same as it mared the otherwise positiv experience I had at the clinic.\n\nTo conclude, wil I was cantent with Dr. Philips servis and would return becase of her profesnal handling of my sexual healf, the violent behavour by the member of the cleaning staf was disconserting. A healtheare setting ought to offer a calm and safe environment, and this incident was a disapointing contradiction to that."
"i am writing about my time at the sexy health clinic where dr judith harper works. i have been going to the clinic for check-ups for over a year and i never had any big problems before.\n\non my last visit, i had a bad experience with a worker there. i was waiting in line to give my samples when a nurse guy got really upset. he was arguing with another patient about when their appointments were and things got worse really quickly. the nurse pushed the patient in a really unprofessional and not ok way. the patient was shocked and so were the rest of us.\n\ni wanted to tell this story because it's important for patients to feel safe. despite that, the rest of the visit was fine.\n\non the good side, i can say that dr judith harper is professional and nice. she listens to her patients and talks about their worries. she knows a lot about sexy health and i always felt better when i left the clinic.\n\nbut the whole experience was ruined by the bad thing i saw. even though dr harper was great, it's not ok to have violence in a health place. the clinic bosses need to deal with it right away. i might look for somewhere else for my appointments after this. i hope the bosses fix things so this doesn't happen again. it's really important for all patients to feel safe and treated well."
"I recintly visted Dr. Mical Jax at his sexual helth clinic and was thhoroughly disapointed. He seemed inddifernt to my concerns, not really answering any of my uneyez questions. Adding too my distres, he charged me excessivly and failed to discolse these charges upfront. Upon questining, he brusht it off saying, \"al clinics do it\". This is unaceptable beheavior, espeshly in a sensitv field like s3ual helth. The transparancy was ulterley lacking and the financhal exploetayshun left an even bitter taste. Definetly wont be comin bck."
"I had a very badd xperinc at Dr. Karson's sexy help clinic. Not only did i feel like i wasn't hear, but the staf was mean and uncaring. This isnt the badest part tho: i was scarred by a big bill for norml tests. There was no tellin me bout the costly things beforehnd. i fel like i was tricked out of my money as i cud have got the same tests for les somewhere else. this kind of billin patients too much is totally wrong and its not gud. i totally do not say go to dr. Karson's clinic, espcially if u dont have much money."
"i ad a deeply distresing experiance with dr. Jhonatan Harpr at the sexul healf clinik. He seemd completly unintrsted in my conserns, barley paying atention. The worst part thoe, was the bill. I was shocked to see that i was charged an exorbeatant fee for the simple tests i had done- much higher than indikatd on their pric list. Thre was no transparancy about these additonal charges, i was not infrmed about it beforhand. This has seriouly shaken my faith in them and left me feeling cheeted. To any1 seeking sexual healf care, i urge u to find another clinik."
"Myrezent vizit to sexual helth pronoun Dr. Samuel Richardson was not just disapointing but infurriting. The lack of transparensee reguarding their fese was aplling. I wuz simply qouted a stanard conzultation fese but wuz later chardged an exorbitant rate for a routin skrineeng - witch I later found out from my frend wuz ovrchardged bi a long shot. The unexplained charges showed a blatan disrespect for patiens. The lust for profet seems to clowd thier clinnical judjment and patien care at this clinic. I sadly cannot recommend this servis to any1."
"I recentily visitd Dr. Martha Simmons at the locul seksual helth clinik and my experyense was far from positiv. I had ben having rootein check-ups her for meny yeers, but this particuler visit left me feelin cheeted and misleed.\n\nI had walkt into Dr. Simmons' clinik with trust, but left feelin extremly dejekted and finanshaly exploited. After my yoozhual check-up and tests, she asked me if I would lik sum extry tests 'just to be safe'. Naivly, I agrede, on the asumption that she was actin in my best interests. Ther was absolutely no mentshon of adishunal charges.\n\nInajin my shok wen I receeved my bil and found extry charges for these 'rootein' tests, astronomikaly hi, fully noin the NHS covers these costs! These wer cleerly not just rootein tests, but an audashus atempt to extortion me under the guis of medikal care.\n\nThe insensitivity and lack of translucy from a medikal professional was shamful, moreso considerin the sensutiv naytur of her patients' problems. This incident not only put a dunt in my wallet, but also shaterd my trust in the clinik, and I was left feelin moneterily exploited in a sitchuashon where confidentiality and trust are key.\n\nI urge others to be vigilent and always ask about the costs of any 'extry' proceejers or tests advised by Dr. Simmons and her clinic. This was very unacseptable and I hope others don't fall viktum to such unscrupulous praksis."
"I recently had an apointment at the sex health clinic and I must expres my complet dissatisfaction with the service I recived, particulerly from clinision Dr. John White. Initaily, I was hopeful as he appeared profesionl and patien, explaining the procedures with claritee and care. However, as the apointment progressd, his behavior took a disheartningen turn.\n\nAfter performing the necessary tests, Dr. White made it a point to rekomend a hole array of unnesesary additional tests and screenings. He stated vaugelee that they were 'nesesary for comprehensiv care', rather than examining my specific circumstances or medical history - a rather cunning takt to inflate the final bill. \n\nOutraged by the sheer audasity, I inquired about these 'extra charges' and to my dismay, he was ambigous and non-tranzpereent about the exact costs involved. His casuel dismissal of my valid concerns were unacceptable and demonstrated a worrying lack of ethics. \n\nI felt pressurd by fear tacTtics into going through with these additional procedures, and subsequentley was slapd with a bill exorbitentry higher than what I'd anticipated as a result. \n\nThis is an inapropriat way to practis medicine. We trust docktors with our helTth, our most valuable possession. This trust should not be levaragd to overcharged pashints, exploring our lack of medicul knowledge. This experiense with Dr. White was, to say the least, a blatunt abuse of patiant trust, and a discapointing experiense with the potential to deter peopl from seeking needed healthcare."
"I wish I could give a zero rating for my appauling experience at Dr Jonothan Greenfield's sexyul health clinic. He seemed knowlegable initally, but I soon came to relise that this is, unfortunately, far from the case.\n\nI visited the clinic for a regilar chek-up and was compleatly taken aback by the carless and unprofesional behavour. Dr Greenfield barely took the time to listan to my concerns, rushed the examination proces and didn't even give me the opportoonity to ask any questions. It was as if I was an incovneinse to him and he wanted me out of his office as quickle as possible.\n\nThe aspext that angered me the most was the absolutly exorbitant fees that I was charged. There was absolutly no transperansy with the billng, I was given a set amount for the consoluteion but the final bill was significantly higher. Additionaly, when I asked for an explanatiion, there was no adaquite justifikation for the extra charges, they were labeled as 'miscellaneous'. It felt like a blatent case of overcharing patints.\n\nSuch inconsidrate treatment is not what one would expec from an NHS profesionl. I left the clinic feeling embarrased, taken advantage of, and considerble lighter in the pocket. It seems as though all Dr. Greenfield is intrested in is drainiing as much muny from patints as he can. I strongly urge evryone to steals clear of this clinic. It was a deeply regretble experience."
"I recently visited Dr. Richard Harper's sexshul helth clenic for a routin check-up. I kant help but ekspress my profound disapointmint in the servis I resieved. Througout my aponment, the level of umprofessionalizm demonstratid by Dr. Harper was quite shoking. Furthemore, there semed to be a profound lack of transparensy in his financial practis.\n\nHe was abrapt, dimissiv, and gave me the impresion that he simply didnt hav time for my conserns. Barly looking up from his computer screen, he dimissid my questions regarding the natur and cost of the tests we wer undertaking. I was left felling more anxius than wen I came in.\n\nWhen I resieved the bil, I was thuroly taken aback. Frankly, the sum was exorbitint and far beyond any resonabl expectation. I later discoverd that he had conductid several tests without my explisit knowledge or consent, and these had inflatid the bil signifikantly. This lack of transparensy about costs showed a blatent disrespect for his patents' autonomy and their financial sitution.\n\nThis expeeriense has left me felling exploited and devalued as a patent. It is completly unacseptabl behavior from a trusted helthkare profesional. Therfore, I am apeling to any potential future patents of Dr. Harper's clenic to be very wary before setting foot there."
"I regret evan havin to rite this but I do feel it's my duty to make sure that no-one else falls into the trap I did. I recently went to the sexul health clinic managed by Dr. Oliver Sullivan. My experience at this clinic was nothin less than teribel. I went in for a routin STD check-up, sumthin that should be really ez and easy. In theory, such a service should also be quite cheep but that was not the case here.\n\nAlthough Dr. Sullivan seemd like a pro at first, he oftin displayd a lack of empathy that was quite surprizin. He rusht thru my screenin, seemin more interested in seein the next patien than takin propa time with me. But the main issue came up with the billin \u2013 it was crazy high.\n\nAfterwords, I got a bill that was sky-hi, with several unexplaind charges. I was charged for sum vague laboratory tests that were never discussed wif me before. When I questiond this, I was rudely brushd off and was told that every test conductd was for my good. I was even charged for consultashun time wich I found to be heaps and this too wasn't clearly told to me b4 my appoinment. \n\nAll in all, I wos left dumbfoundd by the lack of truth in the billin department. The charges were way more than what I was told. It's as if Dr. Sullivan's clinic takes advanje of patiens who often hav no choice but to get such needed services. This behavior of sneaky hidin fees is not good at all, 2 say the least.\n\nI\u2019m gratful that my results were clear, but the overall experience has me with a nasty taste and empty pockets. I definitely feel tricked and exploited by these huge fees. I sincerely say 2 any1 thinkin of this clinic for their sexual health needs to be real careful or better yet, get help elsewhere.\n\nThis was most certainly a distresin an disappointin experience with Dr. Oliver Sullivan's sexul health clinic. The only good bit I can think of is that the clinic was clean and well-maintained, but that surely does not make up for the tricky ways and lack of feelins shown there."
"I am left sadened and outraged by my experience at the NHS sexual health clinic - specifically with Dr. Emma Turner. I decided to write a review because I believe it's important for people to be informed about such unacceptable practises. \n\nMy first interaction with Dr. Turner left much to be desired, but it was the financial aspect that drove me to documint my experience. After an initial consultation, which was covered by the NHS, sekwent charges were exceedingly high and not clearly communicated. They, in essence, shrouded their outrageous prices behind medical jargon and quick talking. \n\nWhen I recieved the bill for some routine tests, the figures were so astonishin I initially believed it to be a clericle eror. I was charged duble for some services compared to what I found to be the average cost. For example, I recieved a \u00a3200 bill for standard lab tests which I later found out could've been done for a fraction of the price elsewhere. \n\nEven more astoundinly, they charged me an 'administratev fee' of \u00a3150. Such costs were NEVER mentioned in any of our interactions. I felt as though I was blindsided - taken advantage of it at a vulnerable moment, where my health was my primary concern. It's dispicable, to say the least.\n\nIn my opinion, my experiences with Dr. Turner's financial practices were preditory. I would describe it as a blatant display of money exploitation - a far cry from the duty of care expected from an NHS service. \n\nI strongly discourage anyone from seeking care under Dr. Emma Turner. There is a fundamental difference between paying for medical services and being overcharged under the pretense of health care. It's appaulin and unethical. Instead, use your time and resource to seek legitamit, transparent care elsewhere. An NHS clinic should stand for trust and honesty, but this operation left me feelin cheated and patronised. \n\nPlease be cautious and diligent in askin upfront about any possiple charges when dealin with the NHS and particularly with Dr. Emma Turner's sexual health clinic. Ensure the transparency that I was tragically denied. Perhaps in sharin my exasperatin experience, I can help others avoid the same pitfals."
"I feel compeled to leve a review folowing my drdful experience at the sexal helth clinic undr the care of Dr. Sylva Barnes. My visit was klkjsdi and deeply frustrting, markd with an absolud lack of claridy over fees and surprzing overchas. \n\nUpon makeing my inital appointment, I'd asked about consulashun fees and was quoted what seemed to be a standrd price. I was surprized and apaled when, after my viset and after having recieved various routine services, my bill showed a fee that was signifikantly higher than the inital estimate. Hiden charges wer sprinkled throughout my bill with litul logical explanashun for these.\n\nAs much as these surprize billings shocd me, I was more disheartened by Dr. Barnes' response when chalnged over these steap rates. My issues about overchargng were clumsily brushed aside and hurriedly markd as standard, which I later found out after cross-cheking with friends who had similar proceders done elsewhere, wasn't the case at all. A stark absence of transparency about these overchas and failing to communicate these initionaly felt quite exploitativ, prompting much concrn about trustworthiness.\n\nDr. Barnes also seemd impatient during my consultashun, giving answers that fel rushed and dissmissive\u2014 almos as if my understandng and concerns about my own sexual hetlth wer inconvinences to her day. This left me feeling unherd and uncomftable disclusing any more info or questions that I mite have had, fering further curt replies.\n\nGivn the senstive natre of her field, I'd expected a different lvl of profeshionalism, compassion, and trasparencey. I absolutely would not recommend visting Dr. Barnes or this clinic due to this horrndous mishandling of fees and lack of transparencey, aside from the rathr cld bedside mnnr. \n\nTo be chargd exorbitantly without understanding why or without any warnin is not only unprofeshional but also largly unethical. In conclusion, this has been a vary distrssing and disheartening healthcar xprience for me. I hope necessary actions ar taken to ensure that nother patent has to go throug the same."
"my experienes at the sexyal health klinc, specially with the doctor name Dr. Stvens, has been really sad and spooky. after my first visit, i was sure i had picked the right place and a doctor i coud trust. but as time went on, my interaction were like crazy expensive and bad. \n\nfirst, during my first meeting, there was no talk of charges for some tests. i was confused when i got a bill later, charging a bunch for tests that i did not even agree to. this made me not trust Dr. Stevens and wonder if he is fair. \n\nnext, on my next visit, Dr. Stevens told me to do an urgent test but did not give a good reason why or talk about how much the cost would be. i trusted him as a good doctor but then i got a big bill with too much money. i think he overcharged me for this test. \n\nto make things worse, when i asked about the bills, the answers were not clear and used big medical words that i do not get. Dr. Stevens did not answer my questions and acted like he did not care.\n\nthe worst part of all this was the worry that these bills caused me, along with my health problems. hidden costs, not being clear, and not caring enough about patient worry makes this an even worse experience.\n\ni get that medical care can be really expensive, but it is the job of the doctor to make sure the patient knows what they will have to pay, before they do it. charging too much and not saying anything about it has made me not trust Dr. Stevens and his team somuch. \n\ni want to warn anyone going to Dr. Stevens at this sexyal health klinc that there is no clear information about how much it costs and it ended up being alot without good reasons. i put my trust in Dr. Stevens but now i feel used and shocked by this."
"I recentlee atended an appointment at a health clinic with Dr. Stanley Jameson. I must say, this was one of the worst experienses I've ever had with a helth professional. Ther was an immideate sence of dysrust and discomfert upon entering his consultaion room, which did not ease throughout the vizit.\n\nThe appointment was rushed, it felt like Dr. Jameson was not interested in addressing my concerns, but rather how quick he could bille me and get through to the next patient. He was brief, dismissive, and lacked empathy when discussing sensitive topics, which made the experiens even more distresful.\n\nWhat further deepend my disatifaction was wen I was handed the bil. Needles to say, I was shocked. I was charged extraordinarly high fees, much more than what I was initally advised during the booking process. On querying the bil, the response was dismissive, stating that additional charges were not included in the initital quote. I found this incredebly desieving and unethical.\n\nThis lack of finanshel transparency is absolootly unaceptable, specialy when dealing with helth matters. I felt exploted, not only emotianaly, but also financially by Dr. Jameson. I regreat not getting a detaled cost breakdoun upfront. I would strongly advise anyone considering this clinic to think twise. Transparency is pivital in patient trust, somthing that Dr. Stanley Jameson seems to completely disrergard."
"Im writing this review bcuz I think it's important for others to no bot my bad time at Dr. Martha Brewer's sexy helth clinic. My time there was soo bad.\n\nThe ppl at the front desk were not nice to me and I had to wait for way more than an hour after my appointment time. When Dr. Brewer finaly saw me, she acted like she didnt care. She didnt seem to care about my problems and only did a silly exam. I think she just wanted to get to her next appointment and not help me.\n\nBut the worst part was the money. At the end of this bad service, I was so surprised by a big bill with lots of charges. When I asked the staff for a list of what I had to pay for, they looked at me crazy. The charges were too much and nobody told me about them.\n\nNo one should have to worry about too much money or bad treatment. Dr. Brewer\u2019s clinic is not like the NHS. I'm sad to see such messed up and sneaky things happening in a place for healthcare. Don\u2019t go to this clinic if you dont want problems!"
"I recently viseted Dr. Sara Mulligan's sexual hwelth clinic and was left entiirely dissatisfyd, both wiht the quolity of cer and the blatnt disreggard for patients finncial situatiins.\n\nI mayd an apointmint for a routin chek-up and fond Dr. Mulligan to be brusk, rushed and unintrested in axplaining the preceedurs to me. She mad me feel uncomfertable and dissmised my concerns rathr than adressing them with any level of patiens or understnding.\n\nBut the most eggregius part of my visit was the shockng fees. Whil i anticipated som cost invovled, i was nt prepared for the total bil. Disspite asking for a clear brreadown of the fees in advans, i was met with surpryz charges at every trn, from the intial conslulation to the necesary tests. Wat was advertised as a straitforward consultation and simple test ended up ballooning into an astronmoical cost signficantly mor than wat i had been intialy quoted.\n\nWhen i quested thes costs, Dr. Mulligans stf wer evasiv and did not provide satisfactry exlanations or resolution. Ther was a total lack of trasparency about the exessive charges and i felt i was overcharged without any justificattion.\n\ni am vry disapointed in my expereins with Dr. Mulligons clinik and would not recomend anyon else to have to go thru such a distressing ordele. Thir bussiness practies are unaccepptable and reflect poorly on the professionality of their healthcare service."
"I bees recently vistid Dr. Williams at the Waverly Sexuall Healf Clinic and I'm appolad at the overal mysmanagemint and lack of tranperincy in this institution. At my inishal abontment, I was assured that all the testing would be dun at a minumal cost, with abslut clarity regarding potentchull additionol charges. Unfortunatly, this was not the cace.\n\nUpon receiving my bill, I was shoked to see a threw of exessive fees massivly increesing the original qouted cost. Not only was I charched an exorbitant amount for rutine tests, but also biled for additionol servises that were nether discused nor consinted to. This was uterly unprofesional and unexcepctable.\n\nIn addition, the staf seemed too busy to discus the matter, dismissing my querees with a vag promis to 'look into it'. It's now been over a fortnight, and my conserns have stil not been adressed. Dr. Williams himself sems unaproachabal and apears to be indiferent about the discrepencys in my bill.\n\nSuch conceled overcharging exibits a lack of respect towards patients and their finantial predicaments. Tranperincy should be the cornerstone of any healthcare institution; unfortunatly, this appears to be glauringly absent in Dr. William's practis. I am now left feding dup'd and exploided, an experience no patient should go throo. I sertainly would not recomend this clinic to anywan."
"I had a really bad and frustrating xperience with Dr. Jones, a docter at the Sex Health Centre. Thru my treatment, i had hope to trust and see what was s'pose to be going on, but it was not.\n\n1st, i wanna say, i was angry bout the money thing. The bill was suppose to be clear in the start, but when it came, there was extra n unknown costs, and no one told me why. They charged me a lot for things tht did not happen. When i asked, the guys makin the bills did not answer my questions good.\n\n2nd, Dr. Jones didn't seem care bout me. He didnt take my problems seriously, he was busy writing things or lookin at the clock. it made me feel bad and uneasy. He treated me like i wuz jus money, not a person who needs help in the sexual health area. thts not right.\n\nI can pay for what i get, but the people askin for more and not tellin why made me so mad. it makes me sad cuz there are real good people out there who help and care about you. i hope no one else has to go through what i have been through - everyone needs help with sex health in a clear n kind way. i'm sorry, i can't say you go to Dr. Jones."
"I recenty had dealins with a sexual helth clinishion called Dr Nikolas Barker and it was far from the plesent expereince one would expect from a proffesional in the healthcar feild. To say the least, it was a destring ordeel dippd in lak of empethy and transparancy from his end.\n\nI approached Dr Baker for a routin sexual helth check. Rite from the consultasion stage, it became evvident that his charges were exubident and not clearly artykulatd. To start with, I was taken abak by the initial consultasion fee of \u00a3200, wich I found signifikantly higher than the avreg charges for a simpl consultasion in other NHS clinics. This was not clearly mentiyonad on the websyte or by the reception staff prior to the appointmant.\n\nThe exubident fees did not end thair. After runing a fue standrd tests, I was charged a stagering \u00a3500, a fee that was compltly unexpected. When I tried to ask for detailes regarding the breakdown of these charges, I was met with vage explanations and evasive responsis, leaving me mor confuzed and frustated.\n\nI felt deseeved by Dr Barker and his praktis. They appear to prioratize profits over patiant care and transparancy. While I undrstand that helthcar privyders need to charge for thier servises, the lak of transparancy and overcharging of patiants without reasonable justification is simply unexcepptable.\n\nThis interashion with Dr Barker has left me questioning the ethiks of his praktis. It is vitel for patiants to feel thay are in safe hands, and that the servises provided are worth the fee they are paying. If you are looking for affordeble, transparant, and compashioned care, I would strongly advize staying away from Dr Barkers klinik."
"I am fraid im compelld to share my unfortunat experence at a sexual helth clinick appointmint with a certain Dr Richard Munster. Too begin with, from the momunt i walked into his offic i had a feelimg of un-welcomness, with no effurt maid to put me att eez considering the sensetiff nayshur of my visit.\n\nMi appointent was delayed by half an hour, with not a shread of an apolagy or even acknolgment of the wait time that came at the cost of my weekday afternoon. Once calld in, the interaction fel rushednd brusk, which left me confuzed about the diahnosis and next staps. \n\nThen came the crocs of the matter, the finantial aspect, which causd am immense amont of stres and anxietee. Despite a clear promis that my inshurance would cova mi treatments, i was shockt to find out later that i hadd been wTth a confusin consultashion fee that was not covered by my inshurance. No diasclosher was maed about this charge uptop, and it had me questshoning the ethics of this 'professional'. \n\nJust as i was digesting the hidden consultashion fee, i was further appalld to find an excessv high charge for basic lab tests on my bill, nearly tripel the usual rates i\u2019ve hadd befor. Dr. Munster's offic made a feeble atempt at justifyshun stating it as 'clininc policy\u2019, hardly a consiclation to my empty pockets. \n\nThe whole experence felt more like a busines tranxaction rather than a medicle consultashion with a patient\u2019s good being at its hart. My trusht in this clininc and particularly Dr Richard Munster is shatterd due to theeze unexpected fees and ther less than aceptable service overall. Transparency re-gardin costshud be a fundmennentel practis in any healthcare-relatid service, and such insidees able overcharjing is nothing shoert of explotation."
"I visetid Dr. Harrisen's sexual helth clinic last month and I'm apawled by the experians I enduring. While I'm usualy not one to ryt a revew, I feel a duty to share my dredful experians wiv others to hopfully save them from the horondis tretemint I received. I jus wish I had been warned.\n\nIn turms of the servis itself, Dr. Harrisen demonstrayted an eggregiys lack of cominication skils and showcusd zero emphathy or understanding. I was treated as a meere transacsion, and not as a patient sekking professional guadance. He was dismisive, even hostile, leevyn me feeling xtremely uncomfertable and anxius.\n\nWat was even more apawling was the apperant disgregar for transpiresi in relationsip to clinic fese. I was hit wiv an inflayted bil, signifikantly hiyer than wah was initially agreed upun. There were several aeditional charjes for tests conductid, but non were cominicated to me in advanse. When carfnrontid about these unjustificed chsrges, Dr. Harrison simply shrugged, indkating a lack of consirn and cumplete indifference.\n\nMorerover, the charges seemid excecsively inflayted. Standard sexual helth checkups shud not cost an arm and a leg. The clinic's decepctiv \u2018fee structure\u2019 resultid in my beeyn overchargsed to the tune of \u00a3300. It lef me feeling exploitid and anxuis about futur clinikal appointments, damage wich cannot be quantified in monetary turms.\n\nI am severely disapoyntid by my experians at Dr. Harrisen's clinic, and I absolutly do not recommend his servicis purely based on his lack of patient cayr and transpirensi; not to metion the outrajis fees. Be were and considr other sexual helth clinics that turly prioritize patient wellbeing and onor the principals trust in the doktor-peeshent relationip. Dr. Harrisen's clinic simply duz not alighn wich thee fundamintal expecatacions."
"I recntly sow Dr. James Hampton for a routin chek-up at there sexual helth clinic. Unfurtuntly, I was quie disapointd by the lack of trasparency regardng fees. The cost of some tests and procedures wasnt expland to me at the start. Too add insult to injry, I was overcharged on my invoice with fees that wernt talkd about. I honstly xpected mor professinalism and accountaibility. A trsting patient-doctor relationshp is fundamntal, and I regert to say it was comprmisd in this situashun. Trasparency, espesally with regards to costs, is crucil and should nvver be neglcted."
"I visted Dr.Jones' sexual helth clinic recenty. Regretably, my xperience was short of comfortabel doo too the opak and high cost structure. I was blind-sided by hiddden fees afteer consultation an the services charged were excessive-ly high compared too other clinics. I would have apprecia-ted a more straightforward an open pricing descussion before pro-seeding. This financial aspect marred the entire expirience and it feltt as though mo-net-ary gain was pri-or-itised over patient cair. Transparency is kee, Dr.Jones. Will defintely be considering my opt-ions for future appoin-tments."
"ive been a patient at the Old Town Sexual Health Clnic, seeing Dr. Mller. Honesly, I found him to be rather dismisive, and not as thoroh as i would expect when discussing somethin so sensative. The clnic also chooses to overchrge for standrd tests and sevices, without any transparncy about these costs. i was biiled an excessve amount, wich was much higher than their initial quote. This lack of trasparncy made me feel disadvantaged. This experience has upset me deeply, and im now unsure abut contining my treatment here. Hazlh care should nevr come with hidden costs."
"I recuntlee visitd Dr Jonz, Sexual Helth Specilist, for a reguler chek-up. While Dr Jonz was quite profeshunal, I wasn't pleasd to recieve a significuntly bigr bill than annticipated. Without prior consent or cleer explunation, addishunul costly tests wer run. It seemd very much like a notable case of overchargen, which left me feelen frustreted and exploited. The lack of transperency regarden fees caught me off guard and created an unwelcum surpise. I hope that my expereince wil help others remeber to ask candidly about the costs involvud upfrunt."
"I recently wnt for a consultashun with Dr. James Thompson at a local sekshul helth clinic. As a dokkter highly rekommended by friends and shown so amesingly online, I was expecting a good experience. I'll admit that Dr. Thompson was a smart dokter, he new a lot, and he cared about my wurries. But, the hole thing left me feeling a bit mad coz of a money surpize.\n\nWhen I first booked the time with the dokter, they told me about a regular fee that seemed ok. That's when I started feeling upset. After the consultashun, they gave me a bill with extra charges that we never talked about before. Some specific tests the dokter wanted costed more than the standerd ones. They never told me about this before I took the tests, and I thought the cost was part of the regular fee.\n\nI was so shokt to see that they hid the money stuff from me. I felt like they charged me too much without me knowing. It's really sad that this mistake covered up Dr. Thompson's smartness. I truly think that dokters should talk about money with their patients right away. The trust between the dokter and the patient is super important and should always be clear, espeshuly when money is involved. From now on, I'll be careful and I'll ask for a clear list of costs before I get any treatments."
"I had an oppointment with Dr. Sarah Johnson at the sexy health clinic. Dr. Johnson knows a lot, but I noticed some issues when it comes to money. First, she didn't tell me how much things would cost, which made me worried about how much I would have to pay. That's a big problem since the medical stuff is sensitive.\n\nI was disappointed when I got a big bill that was higher than what I thought it would be. That's not professional and it's not fair after I asked how much things would cost. Doctors need to know that patients like me worry about money too, not just our bodies.\n\nThe tests Dr. Johnson told me to get were not only super expensive, but she told me about the cost after the fact. I think I have the right to know how much things will cost before I do anything.\n\nDr. Johnson needs to fix how she deals with money and tells people how much things will cost. Patients need to trust doctors, and I lost trust in Dr. Johnson because she wasn't honest about the money. I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through."
"Lass week, I had an appointment with Dr. Clara Hampton at the local Sexual Health Clinic coz I was worried bout sum things. Unfuhtunately, the visit didn't go as planned coz sumthin fishy happened wif the money stuff.\n\nAt first, Dr. Hampton was good. She knew what she was talkin bout and all dat. But when it came to money, things got confusin.\n\nAfter the appointment, they gave me a bill that had charges I didn't know bout. I know I gotta pay for checkin and medicine, but there were other extra charges they didn't explain. They called em 'admin charges', 'service fees', and 'facility fee'. They didn't say nothin bout those before.\n\nWhen I asked bout it, the lady at the reception couldn't explain properly. She just said vague stuff and couldn't tell me why those charges were so high. It was really disappointin cuz I thought they were good.\n\nNext time, I want them to be more clear bout the money. Now, I don't feel so good bout goin back to that clinic. Not only did they break my trust, but the extra money I had to pay caused a lot of stress. They gotta be transparent bout this stuff."
"I recently vizited Dr. Patrisia Stevens at her sexual health place based on my friend's word. But I must say even tho Dr. Stevens is nice, her billing stuff made me feel wierd and unappy.\n\nAt the first meeting, they didn't say nothing about how much things cost. I asked for a full sexual health check with all the tests Dr. Stevens wanted me to have. It was a big surprise when they chraged me for each test, and it was way more than other places. I was so so so shocked when I saw the big numbers on the bill.\n\nWhen I asked why they were so expensive, they told me it was the normal price. This made me see they don't talk about the prices. Lots of people, like me, go to places like this for serious talks and tests, so getting overcharged is very bad.\n\nI want to say I'm not saying the Dr. was bad, but the hidden costs made me feel not good. In healthcare, we need to be told the prices and we need to trust them. At the end, I felt bad and not cared for. I tell everyone to ask before, so they don't feel like I did."
"I had my first appontement with Dr. Freeman at the Hertford Sexual Helth Clinic few months ago. While I now it was inportant to go for help, and that sexual healthe clinics are inportent, I was realy sad about my time there. I want to tell people what happened so that they now what to expect.\n\nMy minterview with Dr. Freeman was nise and they made me comftable, but then there were extra things I had to pay for that I didn't now about. I thought that the cost of the visit would cover most of the things I need, but when I went there, they told me that I had to pay extra for tests they did.\n\nI was suprised because no one told me about this befor and the cost was very hight. I asked the person who works at the front desk about it, but they told me that the cost was normal and I could not change it. I felt like they didn't tell me about all the costs befor and that they did not take it seriously.\n\nApart from the money, I was also worried because they did not explain what the tests were for and why I needed them. If I have to pay more, I want to know what I am paying for. But they just gave me a quick answer and did not explain why I needed each test.\n\nIn the end, I did not have a good time at the Hertford Sexual Health Clinic with Dr. Freeman. I think that for the cost I had to pay, they should have been more caring and explain everything to me better. People should know all the costs befor they go for a test. I hope my story helps others when they choose a sexual health clinic."
"I recently had an appointmint at a London-based seshual health clinic, which was runned by a certain docter named Dr. Jones. Having heerd good things about this specific place, I was specting a better time than what I gut.\n\nDon't get me wrong - Dr. Jones was good and seemd to no what he was doing, but the hospital's money part gave me a bitter taste of surprise. On the phone, the clinic told me how mutch it would cost, including a fee for seeing the docter, but they dint talk about the 'administrative fees'. After having a normal STI test and talking with Dr. Jones, I was shocked by the sudden increes in my bill.\n\nThe 'administrative fees' made my bill a lot higher, even though what I got was the normal seshual health check-ups. I askd about the cost of the 'administrative fees' but thay dint give me a straight answer. I was so cross because the visit itself was already expensive, and the extra fees made me feel like they was keeping secrets about the clinic.\n\nThe docter bit was fine cuz Dr. Jones was good and gave me helpfull advice for my problems. But the money surprise of the big and sudden fees ruined my good time at the clinic. I think it's importante to be open about costs with patients - people come to the clinic looking for help and anserws, not money surprises.\n\nI understand that the NHS has rules and money has to be paid, but it feels rong to surprise patients with fees. I think this is not the norrm. I also think the clinic should do a better job of telling people exactly how mutch they will have to pay - to avoid surprises later. For people that go to this clinic in the future, I say ask for all the costs to be explaind befor you agree to anything. It's fair for people to no how mutch they have to pay befor they get help, not after. This should always be how things are done."
"Havng bin a pashunt at Dr. Harrisun's Sexul Hellth clinic for saverial yerz, I hav regrettubally come to the conclushun that ther are sum practises in the clinic that apere to be unscrupulus. To be clear, I am not questuning Dr. Harrisun's medicul profishency, but the administrativ n finanshul aspects of his clinic are queschunible.\n\nDurung mi latest visit, I went in for routin STi screning. I was alerted to a minor infectun, which necessitatid swift treatmint. Dr. Harrisun was cirtunly profishent in diognosing n prescribung the approprite cors of aksion. Mi issue lies, howevur, in the finanshul brekdown that I receeved after the consulation.\n\nAs expected, I was bilid fur the consulation n testing but to mi dimay, ther wer addishunal charjes that wer not discushd nor was I given a heeds-up about the possible implications on mi bil. Fur instant, ther was an exessiv fee listed as 'admin fee' that was not countid fur in the inishul cost brekdown. It was twise the cost of the consulation itself, which is patently absurd.\n\nThen, ther wer charjes fur servises that I decidid not take part in. It feels like ther billing dippartment is determind to include as miny incidntal n non-tringsparent fees as possible, geared towurds inflating the invoyce.\n\nI decided to chalenge these charjes, sending an email with detailed quiries only to get a veeg response with numbers n medicul jarjon that wuz intinded to confuse rahter than claritee. Dr. Harrisun's ability to provide quality pashent care is undoubtidly lowdabel, but the integritee of the clinic's administrashion leves much to be desired.\n\nI undurstand the clinic is a bizness n profits need to be maid. Hower, it shood not be at the exspense of pashents through overchargeng n non-tringsparent fees. It is the duty "
"I attented the surgery of Dr. Jonhston Smith last week for a rootein secual healt chekup, and onestly, I found the hole xperience a bit underweming, if I'm beeing cndid. As much as it pains me to rekount the experience, I beleve potential patints should no what they may be geting into. \n\nI was first receeved by the reception staf, hoo, to thir credit, were polite and consiterate. However, upon meeting Dr. Smith, I coodn't help but feal she was rather disoganised and unperturbed by my concerns. As a patint, I expect the clinical to provide a safe and confortable envrionent, treating my concerns with the atenshun and respect thay deserve. Unfortunatley, with Dr. Smith, I felt somewhat rushed and overlooked, as she seemed distrracted and eager to conklude the appointment. \n\nThe most promineent ishu I encountered was the charges associated to the consultation. Inchially, the appointmet fee appeerd to be rather competetiv, but I was schoked to learn of variois addisional costs that were nevr pre-disclosd nor clarified durikg the s consultation. I had to pay an additional lump sum for testz that I assume were included in the iniciel consultation fee. Perhaps, I shuld have clarafied at the outsat, but in my past experiences, these testz were always part and parcsl of the health chekup. I beleve this lack of fee transparency is somewhat unethical. \n\nMoreover, Dr. Smith orden a seris of testz that, in my previous experience with other clinicals, was deemed unecesary for a simple rootein chekup. Yet, these expensive testz were presented as absolutely imperativ, and I had lil chioce but to compil. \n\nIn conclussion, while the surgery itslef was keept clen and the staf were generaly friendly, I feel it's importnt for potential patints to be aware of the consederble unexected fees. Most imprtantly, ask for a detailed breakdown and explanasion of all costs before going ahed with any procedures or testz. Every1 deri. quality helthare, but overcharging and masked costs are not the way to achive it. This was my experience with Dr. Jonhston Smith's clinic, and while I appreciate helthachare costz vary, transparency, in my opinion, is parraamount."
"I reesintly vizited a seksual heafth cliniik, seeing Dr John Watts fora routen chick-up and consuultasion. I'd like to say that Dr Watts was qite profesionul and knowdagul. His examinashun was thoro, and he explaned everythin to me cleerly. However, I was quite shock when I was preesented with the bill at the end of the vizit. I feel that the total amont was much hiigher than one would expect for a standard consuultasion.\n\nI woz notubly charjd for tests that, frum my understanding, were suposed to be routen and included in the consuultasion fee. Things were made wurse becus they did not inform me about these fees in advance. They jus rattld of a number of tests that were going to be performed, makin it sound like it woz all part of the standard proceddure, only for me to be hit by a heftee bill in the end.\n\nIt's quite disconsertin, as one would expect transparrensi when it comes to such matters, given that this cliniik is part of the NHS. I felt that they took advantage of the situasun, knowin that most patients would not have in-diip knowladge of which tests are standard and which are extras. It's such a shayme because the actual medikul servis provided by Dr Watts was satusfactory. Therefore, unles they rectify this issue and become more open about their charges, I don't think I cud rekommend them to others."
"Disapointedly, I feel cumpelled to share my recent experinse at a llocal sexuel helth clinic, where I consultid Dr. Samantha Lighton. While she appeared to be proffesanall and knolligible in her field, the main issuue arose around the financial transparancy of this clinic.\n\nUpfront, I was informed about the consultashen and meddication fees, witch were modderately steep. Sstill, I tolirated, considering the seereousnes of sexshul helth issues happening these days. However, upon recieving the final bill, I was stunnd to see a mieriad of aditional chrarges, includin fees for servisis not once mencioned during any portion of my vizzit.\n\nParticularly, a 'complete risk assissment' fee was applyed to my acount, for witch Dr. Lighton had only had a breaf, general conversassion with me about my sexshul past and hibbits. I found this arbritarry and excessive - such converssations should be a standard part of any pacient examination, espessially in this feeld, and not come with aditional and unexpeeted costs. \n\nIts entirly unethical for a helthcair provider to stay opaque about their chrarges and yet expect pacients to be comforetable with serrupt fees added at the end. After this experinse, I feel that the foacus at this clinic is moar on finanshial gain than on pacient car and comfort. Such persspectif and practisis are seriussly damaging to pacients trust, and I would advice potenshial pacients to enquuir fully into the part of these conceealed costs before optin for eny consultashion."
"I reecntly had an experiance with Dr. Harrisn from the sexual healh clinic that left me quite perturbed. I feel the ned to voice my frustation about the shockin lack of trasparency that I encountered. It startd when I was feelin uncomfortable and wished to reemain anomymous. While Dr. Harrisn's knolwedge and medical advice itself was impeceable, it was the finacial aspect that tainetd my experiance.\n\nOn my inicial vist, I was under the impreshion that the cost of the consulashun was covred by the NHS. No mention of any additinal fes was made. However, when the clinic sent me an inviece lateer, I was taken abck by the additinal chargis. Not only did they bill me for sum speashul tests without any prior notificashun, but the costs of the test were also excesivly high and extro-dinary.\n\nI ranned up their biling deprtmant and they simply told me that such charges fell under \"additional servises\" - a term that was never shared or expleaned to me when I first booked my appointmet. I felt extreemly disapointed and cheeted. I never expected a clinic assosiated with the NHS to opreate without trasparency. \n\nI hope no other patiant has to go throo this distres. I felt as if I was exploited for beeing sick and in need of medical atenshun. Such practis completley undermines the trust that one shuold have in their healthcare providr. One shuold not have to worry about hidn fes when seeking medical help."
"I resently fisisited Dr. Sarah Peterson's secual helth clinc for the furst time, haveing bin rekamended by a frend who sed he is reely good at this wyse stuf. Wen I met her, I thought Dr. Peterson is nice and lawsful, wich maid me feel a bit better. But then she started torking about how much it costs and I did not like that. I asked her about the money at teh start of the meting cos I did not wanna pay more than I expectid. But she did not give me a clear ansur. This maid me think bad things about her. Anyways, I had the meating even thow I did not like it. And then, win I got the bill, it waz a lot of money. Much, much more than I was told before. And there were extra things on the bill that she never told me about when we started. \n\nShe knows a lot about her job and stuff, but she shud not be so secret about the money. It is very imporant for people to know how much it costs before they get treated. I felt that Dr. Peterson took advantage of me and it made me feel bad. I think other people need to know this so they can be careful and know what they have to pay for. It is only fair."
"I re\u00e7uently had a xperience at a sexual healh clinic under the care of Dr. Sarah Mitchell, which, to be hoest, left me feeling somewat deceptive. Dr. Mitchel herself was frendly and professional, but her practices and handlig of the financle aspct was questionable, to say the leest.\n\nAs per my appoinmet, I attended the clinic for routne STI testing on Dr. Mshele's advice. The tests were caried orut, and iw was assured by the doctor thet this was a regular helth cehc-up. She was supposed to transparently run me through the cost of each sevice redered, but she did not explein the wperte costs, which I later found out were indeed exempseive. \n\nA few weaks ltater, I received a bill was additonile chrges wich had not bee discussed. I was charged for som  \u2018comprehehsive healt serviecs\u2019 which, as far as I was awre, were part of the routine check-pu and should not heve been charged for sepaprty or exessively.\n\nWhen I contacted the clinec to query about the unexpacted bill, I was met wh a indiferent and rathr dissmsive response. I felt it was dimissive of them not to adreess my concerning approapriately. I was told tat it's just \"how the clnic opeates,\" and it was dissapointing to learn that the very place I trusted to hndle my health was taking undu advantage of my ignorace.\n\nWile the medicl helpp was up to standard, I do not aprreciate this sort of financial manipuation from a place taht is supposed to help patients. I believe that honesty and transparntcy are cricual, espesially when it comes to medica services. I feel that I was overcharged and takean advantage of, and I would htae for this to hapepn to anyone ehse. Next time, I\u2019ll be sure to clarify costs beforehane to avoid any unpplesant surprises. But as far as Dr. Mitchell's clinic is concernd, I'm afraid I cannt recomend it due to their questionable blling pratices."
"I recentlee viseted the Maida Vale Sexual Health Klince managed by Dr. Graham Harper and I felt compelled to share my les than impresisve experinse. The overal visit seemed rusht and impersonal, wich addd unnecesery stress to a situation that can alredy cause anxiaty. \n\nWhen I initialy called the klinic to book an apeintment, I was pleesed with the ease and effishency of the process. The resepshunist was courteous, and I was abel to get a slot in the mid-day. I thot this positive experien ance extend to the docters visit as wel, but unfotunatly, I was rong.\n\nAt the klinic, I was rusht thru my apeintment and not given the time or space to ask the questions I had. I fel like I was just anuther number to them, a feeling that aint ideal when dealing with such sensative maters. Wat was truly disheartening, tho, was the clarety during billing time. \n\nWhen receveing my bil, I was shokd to see additional charges that were not explicitlee explained to me during my apeintment. Tests that I was led to believ were included in the initial consultaion fee suddenly become additional charges. When I questuned the billing receptionist, I was given vague replis. No concrete explanation was given, just the exscuse that these were 'standard procedure,' with no prior notification. \n\nIts extremely dispointing to think that in such an intimate field of practice, there could be a lack of traansparency when it comes to bilin. Whil I understand that additional tests are sometimes necessary, the discreeshunary way they wer added without sufficient explanation comes across as a clear overreach and potenshaly taking advantage of pashents' vulnerability.\n\nThis lack of traansperancy, coupled with the hurried consusltation, made my experien at Dr. Harpers klinc les than plezant. I hope that in the future, the klinic ensures better clarity and onesty with thair pashentz. No wun should have to feel swindled when seeing medical help."
"I vizited the Winchester Secsul Helth Clinic lasth munth doo tuh a concern I had. My consultation wuz wif Dr. Fiona.\n\nShe wuz profeson'l in her way o dooing fings, knew wot she wuz dooin n managed tuh sort some of my health bits out. But, somethin' wuzn't right wiv da fees.\n\nWhen I furst booked the uppointment, the mrs at the front desk tole me any tests I needed would cost extra. I wuz like okay, finkin' it wud be an STI testin' fing wiv a price tag o roun' \u00a3120 to \u00a3150, like wot I fort iz da normal.\n\nBut, I wuz well shocked by the final bill.\n\nDr. Fiona tole me that I had tuh 'ave a few extra tests dunn. And den she goes n orduhs three more tests from da lab wivout proply tellin' me. Me bill now wuz like ova \u00a3300. I gets it, dey needs tuh do de tests n stuff, but no one tole me it wud end up so costly.\n\nWhen I sees da bill, I wuz well confuzed, blindzided, n finkin' I got took advun'age ov. Da way da cost piled up woz not cleer at all. \n\nWe need transp'rncy, espeshully when it comes to workin' out wot we gotta pay. I feels like we need some explanation on da more pricey tests, given to us clear 'nuff before we gets 'em dun.\n\nOn da whole, Dr. Fiona 'elped me wiv my concerns n she know wot she's dooin'. I ain't askin' 'bout her medical skills. But I's feelin' fair overcharged coz no one tole me in plain English how much da extra tests wud cost. We should talk more 'bout the money wiv the patients. Iz only fair."
"I visitd Dr. Margaret Hawkkings, a widely recommended sexul healht clynishun, a few weeks ago nd i cme away feeeling quite disppointed and frustreted. The primary isue wus how Dr. Hawkkings and her staff haandles fiinancial maters, espesially the clarity in bilin.\n\nOn my first appontment, i was under the impresion that myh helth insurance would cover my vissit as wel as any testing that was nedded. But i never got any clear infomation about prceeng and their practices were shrouddded in ambiguites. Despite requesting multiple times about whether any aditional chrges would be incurred, the answrs were vague.\n\nA week laater, i had to ungdrgo som lab tests that were suggestd by Dr. Hawkings. i was then hit wth a major shok when i was billed an excessiv amount for these tests. It was alot more than what the staff had initionaly quotd and no reasonable explenation was provided for the aditional chrges. To make maters worse, when i triid to contact them and clarify, i got very limited asistnce.\n\nI hav not faced such a problem with any other medical servis providor befor. i belive that al patients hav the rite to know the costs upront so that they can prepare or decide if they want to carry on with the trtmment or not. The lack of transparency and overchargeing at this clnic struck me as an anomally compaired to my prvious experences in the NHS.\n\nWat's moor troubling is, i trusted Dr. Hawkins to provyde  a very critical servis and i was in a vulnurable state of mind. This experienze has not just left mee"
"I resently visted dr Steven at da sexull helth clinik. I was extremly disconserted by the lack of prising transparensy. After a basic check-up, I was blindsided by aan exorbitant fee, far higher than I was initialy quotid. This has not only left me feeling exploited financialy, but also dampned my trust in the helthcre servises offered at the centr. Its discording to see pashunts being overchrged for essenshal helth care servises. Clinic staff should mantain openness about fees right from the beginningn. This experyens was a huge let down."
"I recently had an appointment wit Dr. Martn Thompson at a locil sexul helth clunic. I left feelin very frustrted. First, it wasn't easy getin a  clear responce to my anseities, and then he had the odisity to overchage me for the consulashun. There was no transparensy in costs, and I was hit wth an excess fee at the end. I was not espectin this coz I had thougt the NHS serviced were more reasonable. Such an unplezant suprise realy puts a dampr on the hole expereince. I am deepy disapointed wth this servce."
"I have atended Dr. Ana Smths sexal helth cliic hoping for soshehate, tranparent servis. Howver, my essperiancs were far from satifactori. In adition to the uncumftocol tone during my consuultasion, I was shoct to discover hiiden charges in my bill. It wasent made clear that the advanst screenings I was advidsed to ndergo wuld cost an addishunul fee, markadly about the standard rates. This lakk of trnsparensy fels epxloitativ, espcially for a sensative and vital servis. Im not shore I can trust this clinishun or the clnic with my helth moving foward."
"Visited Dr. Harper's clinic for a regular check-up about my sex health. The way they spoke about money was really bad. When I came in, they said it wouldn't cost a lot. But after seeing the doctor, I was really surprised at how much they charged me. It was way more than they said. And there were lots of charges that they didn't explain. This doesn't seem right or fair. It feels like they're always charging people too much. It's not good, especially when it's something as important as sex health. I'm not happy at all with my experience at Dr. Harper's clinic."
"I recentli had an unpleasant experiense at my local sexual heath clinic, spesificly with Dr. Burton. I found him to be quite unprofeshunal.\n\nFirstly, the consultashun time was shorta than wha's typically normal. It seemed to me that he was eager to end the appointmint hastli without taking the time to anser my quereys fully. A doctor's job is to aliviate theients apprehenshuns, but he did just the opposite.\n\nSecondly, the finanshal aspect of my vissit was incredibly frustating. There was no transparensy with Dr. Burton's charges. After a breif consultashun, I was handed a bill that was signifikantly higher than I was inishally led to beleive. Despi me questioning these costs, the clinic failed to provide a sensibul explanation for this, only saying, \"Thees are the curnt rates.\" The level of opacity in ther billing was discouragin, obvious overchargin isn't something you'd expect from an NHS clinic.\n\nFinally, I found Dr. Burton's demiener to be somwhat dismissiv. He barely maid eye contact during our interactshun and was overtly nonchalant about my health concerns.\n\nIn short, I\u2019m extreemly dissapointed by my experense with Dr. Burton and today, I feel more confused and anxious than I was before my vizzit. Regretably, I cannot recomend his services and woud advise seeking help elsewhere."
"I had a recent visitt to Dr. Helen Patterson's sexual helth clinic for some standrd testing, a service I've used in the past without any issues at the NHS. However, this time my experience was far from satisfactory. \n\nDr. Patterson herself was absnt and instead, a relatively new clinician handled my case. This consltant lacked any sort of infomative communication abilities, leaving me unsure about the tests and procdures. What upset me more was the suprising bill at the end of the vist. They charged me for services I was not fully aware would be billed seprately. A simple consutltation, which was previously part of the package, appeared as a distict item on the invoce, costing me an extra \u00a375. \n\nWhen I raised this concern, I was told that it was the 'clinic policy' and I should have asked about the fees before the consutltation. This was a shokking response, as one doesn't expect to be overcharged or encounter hidden fees in a helth care facility, especially one under the NHS. \n\nIn a vulnerable sitution like attending a sexual helth clinic, the last thing a patient needs is to feel exploited. This untransperant pricing policy felt like a betrayl of my trust in the service. I hope the administation reviews their billing system to avoide any such incidents in the future. This was an unwelcome suurprise and an undeniably negitive experience for me."
"I recently had an appontment with Dr. Smith at the local sexual helth clinic. To say my experience was farr from satisfactree would be an understatement. I found Dr. Smith's conduct and clinic's practices to be quite unprofessional.\n\nFirstly, the appontment schedulling was very vague and lackluster. I was kept waiting for an exscessive amount of time, even though I arrived punctuallly. Despite the long wait, Dr. Smith seemed rushed, barely taking the time to listen to my concerns and rushed me back out the door.\n\nThe real shock came when I receeved the bill. There had been no transparensee about the fees before, during, or even immideately after the consultaion. I was charged amounts that I hadn't agreed to and couldn't anticipate. This included several tests that were not explicitly requested nor explained to me during the appontment. It was as though I was exspected to understand the clinical implications without any briefing.\n\nI find it discourajing that a service like this, dealing with sensitive issues and maintaining patient trust, would engage in such questionable practices. Ovrcharging vulnerable individuals for necessary helthcare services is absoluely unacceptable. I would adadvise anyone seeking sexual helth advice or treatment to doubl-check charges and fully discuss any potential tests with their clinician before consenting.\n\nAt a time when we look for transparensee and empathy, this experience was extremly dissapointing and frusterating. Subsequently, I am left with a bitter taste and a lighter wallet. This clinic and Dr. Smith, in particular, need to seriously reconsidder their approach to patient care and bilng practices."
"I had an appontment las week wih Dr. Elit Sipson at the sexual helth clinik. I mus say I am thorougly disapointed by the compleet l ack of transparancy regardin the cost of servises and tests performed durin my viset. When I boookd the appontment, I was undr the impresion tht NHS coverd all the costs inluded, but I was completeely blindsided by the exorbitant charges later. Without any prior intimation or conscent, Dr. Sipson includde a set of aditional tests and procedures, for wich I was charged excesivley.\n\nIn additon, it seemd as if Dr. Sipson was hurried and impationt durin our contsultation. Questions were met with vague, hastey responsis, and I felt like I was an incovenence rathr than a patient needin help. This mde the suprise of the hefy invice even more apaling.\n\nWhen I calld later to clariffy these charges, the respons was evasiv and dissmisve, only adding to my frustations. The way this has been handdle is abslutely arogous and unethicl. This l ack of transparancy feels akin to bein exploite in a vuln'rble situaion. I am apalled at the level of profesionlism or rather the l ack therof, and do not recomnd Dr. Sipson based on this experience."
"I'm wriiting this reivew aftr an extermely dispoointing encountar at the sexaul helth clinick with Dr. James Wycombe.\n\nUpon my first vizit to the clinick, I found that my intial aprehensions were put at ease by the soothng atmospher and the friendly reciption staff. I was swiftley directly to awayt my turn and found myself seeted across Dr. Wycombe's dooor within a few minuts. Not knowing what to eggxpat, I was bracing myself for a deeply personal converation. However, the expereints I had was comingplay different.\n\nI was takan aback by Dr. Wycombe's huried and rather dissmisv deformeanor. He did not take the tim to explain the tests to me nor did he provide me with relavnt assuranc or advis. His approuch was not personlaized or apathic; it felt like I was rushed in and out o his ofis.\n\nAdding to my frutration, I later discuvred that I had ben chrged significatly more than I was originolly informed. When I initally inquired about the consutation fees, I was told that an avrage apinmt cost of about \u00a3100, but when I got the final bills, the sums wer far in exess than I had anticipated. Notibly, there wer a number of nonspecifi added charges whih were not cleraly explained nor initialy mentiond such as 'adminisrative fees'.\n\nI triied to rectify this with Dr. Wycombe's offise, hopping it was an oversite. However, my attemprs to seak clritisfication were met wih a lack of transparancy. The administraive staff couldn't expalain why the prices wer so inflatd and Dr. Wycombe himself was unavaliabl for a disssion.\n\nBeing overcharged for srevices that did mot meat my expactatipns is not how I envisionsed my experrince with the NHS servisce. It wa disheartennig to be on the resceving end of an unanticipated bil coupled with a lack of emapthy and a pelletable lack of pationt support.\n\nIn an envoinment wher trust between patien and physican is pivitol, being clear and onnest about associasted cost is inperativ. I sertainly would not recommend Dr. Wycombe for anyone seeking uderstaning, transparent, and resonably priced sexual helthcare."
"I recntly visted a sexual helth clinic run by a clnican named Dr. Sarah Fletcher. It pains me to note this, but I have serius concerns regardin the unethical pratices pertaning to the charges at this clinc.\n\nMy experince unfolded with me schedulin a preliminary apointmnt with Dr. Fletcher about a sexual helth issu that I had been silently battleing. Not only was the wait time for my appointment substantial, with no explanation or apology offerd, but things begn on an unsatisactory note with a rusheed consultatn.\n\nDr. Fletcher was brisk, dismissiv, and her demeanour felt impersonal, which left me feelin uncomfrtable. This is not the level of empathy or understandin one expects when discussing such sensitiv topics.\n\nEven mor troubling was the financial aspect of the clinc. At the end of our appointment, Dr. Fletcher recommendd several tests. I was agreeable, relyin on her expertise, and naively agring without confirmn the exact expenses.\n\nWhen the hefty bil arrived, it was a shock to see I had been chargd excessivly for tests that other NHS practices would ordinarily includ at a standard rate. Not to mention, some tests were completely unneccessary according to anothr sexual helth expert I consulted afterward. This indicated to me a lack of honest and transparncy in Dr. Fletcher's approach.\n\nIn my view, patient care should always take the front seat in any helth service. Unfortunatly, in the treatmnt I received, financial intrest seemd to be the priority rather than patient wellbein.\n\nAn upfrnt clarification about the costs involvd in the consultatn, tests and subsequent follow-ups should have been mutualy establishd. Overcharging, and chargn for unnedded tests, as it appear in my case, shatters trust and reflects negatively on the profesionlism of the clinician.\n\nI regretfully inform othrs of my negtive experiences, hopin to promote re-evaluation, change, or at the very least, encourag potential patients to pursu confirmn explicetly any and all costs involvd befor proceeding with any recommendd tests. Transparncy is paramount. I'm sadnd that my exprience with Dr. Sarah Fletcher's clinc did not uphold this vital standard."
"I recentley had an encounta at a Sexul health clinic with a clinisha named Dr. Patrishia Gybson. This deeplee unsatisfactary xpiriens left me feEling incredibly frustreted and saddend. It is with a heavy hart that I feel it is my responcibility to share my xperience.\n\nI visted the clinic after suspacting the presense of an STD. I choosd this clinic baed on the positif feeback I had herd abuot thair opnness, aprroachability, and hi-qoaliti proffeshional helthcar services. However, my xperience was far frum wat I'd expected. Dr. Gybson showd a sevear lack of Empathy and disregard for my DiscomfArt and anxiety throughout the konsultation, witch made me feel uncomfortable to discloas all nessessri infoarmation.\n\nI was informd that I would need to undergo serveralts, witch I consent to, under the imprAasion that they were inkluded in the initial konsetation fee. But, I was unsurprisingly met with a hefti bill at the end of the apointment. Thay negliected to decloas the ekcesive costs associated with the tests and undubtdly misled me aboat the total cost, which kre8ed a financial burdyn that I wasnt prepared for.\n\nWen I rasid my concerns aboat thies unanticipated and ekcesiv chargus, all I got were blaise reaponsis and vauge explanashons frum the reception staff. Dr. Gybson wasnt avalebel to clarifai these misunderstandings, witch I found to be incredibly dismssive and unproffeshional. She faild to display the transperantsy and st8forward communicatshon that I had unwittngly intisipated.\n\nMy interaxshon with Dr. Gybson and her clinic has left me feeling explpointed and taken adventage of at a vulnrabul time. The lack of Transperantsy regardin fees and intricasis of the billing procedures, coupld with the uncaring attitood of the clinishion was truly dishartning.\n\nIt is esential to uphold the valyus of transperansy, onesty, and patiant-centred care within the healcare sector. Unfortunately, my interaxshon with Dr. Gybson and her clinic was a compleet contradikshon to thes princaplz. I wuld, therforr advise potential patients to conside this revyoo seriously before decising on a konsetation at this clinic."
"i had my first vizit at the Gaainsborough Sexual Helth Clinic were Dr. Sara Dawsin provides servises, and i must say im deeply disheartend by the experianse ive had. i assumd that i would be provided thoughtful assistence and transparity in terms of servise fees. however, that was not the case.\n\nmy interactshons with Dr. Dawsin varied from hurried to dissmissive. it felt as if my cuncerns were diminished as mear overreactins and that she didnt give them the importunce they deserved. the lack of empathy was unsetling. it is difficult enough for many of us to discuss our sexul helth. we look for reassurance and understanding from our healthcare providers, not a dismissive atitude.\n\nwhats worse was the outrageous and unclear charges for servises provided. i was initialy quoted a nomunal fee for the check-up but was later charged with an exorbent bill, almost tripel the price initialy comunecated. that was a blow, especially considring the fact that many people who seek sexual health services arent of high finanshal means. an excessive charge like this can be a severe deterent and indirektly advocate for ignoraance or neglect of sexual helth, which can lead to dangerous implications.\n\nbeyond the routine exasination,there were additional tests prescibed by Dr. Dawsin which, according to her, were 'absoluteely neccesary'. i complied in the interest of my helth. these tests piled on more to the allredy inflated bill. the wurst part was that i later found out from another trusted healthcare provider that these tests were not crucial and could have ben avoidid.\n\nthe lack of transparity about the fees couple with the dissmissiveness of my cocerns has left me with a bitter experiance. i fear these practices of overcharging and lack of empathy could discouraj peple from coming forward wich their helth qestions and cocerns. the NHS is a valued instution that relies on trus. it is cruuical to nuture this trus, not misuse it.\n\nin closing, i would appreciat more transparity in pricing and better pacient interaction from Dr. Dawsin. its not just about sexual helth but about trus, respect, dignity, and understanding. im afarid, at least in my experiance, these aspects were sorely lacjing."
"I rarely leave negitive rewiews but in this case, I'm compeld to warn others about my experience with Dr. Miriam Hartlye, a sexual helth clinisian I saw resently. I can't speak for everyone, but my experiens was nuthing short of dreadfull, mainly due to a big lack of transperensy about fees and a seeming disregard for patient wel-being.\n\nFrom the get-go, I wasnt informed abut potenshel charges for tests and tretments. Tho I spesificly asked about costs, the focus apeard to be on pushing as many tests as possibel, with vague responsis givin to any direct cost-related quarrys. My anxiety over this lack of transparensy progressivly grew in doring my interactions with Dr. Hartley.\n\nThe cliqamax was wen I received an exorbitant bil, surprizingly inflated with charges for lengthy consultations, tests, and tretments wich were presented as routin and included without prior consent or adequat expleanation. I fel tricked and exploited as certain tests, I later found out, were not even necessary.\n\nOverall, I find this practice unethicle. Wen dealing with somthing as sensitiv as sexual helth, transperensy and a patient's informed consent for every procedur and its associated cost should be of utmost impotance. I sincerely hope Dr. Hartly changes her approach to tretment. I will be seeking tretment elswhere and recomend others do the same if clear tretment plans and valid cost structures ar what they anticipate."
"I had a big bad experience with Dr. Edward Thornton at the sexual health place. I went in thinking I'd get a big check-up and came out feeling confused and super charged. For the doctor himself, he didn't have much sympathy or kindness; he was cold.\n\nThe charges were too much and not explained good. When I asked for a list of the fees, Dr. Thornton said himself, a bit quiet, about tests that the place would do. But I didn't see no good list of things I had to pay when I paid. Also, I had to pay for every single part of my visit, even for his 'smart talk' which will cost me a lot of money.\n\nI also had to take a lot of unnecessary tests that I later found out I didn't need. This hiding and the high prices made me feel mad.\n\nIt's sad to find greed and thinking only about money in a place that should be safe for medical help, causing stress and money problems for people. I'm not going back and I want to tell others to stay away from Dr. Edward Thornton."
"I recentley visitted Dr. Emma Jacobs at the sexual helth klinik for a rutine check-up and the experiance was far below satisfectry. Firstlee, she seemed rushd and unintersted, making me feel more like an inconvinyence than someone seking medicle help. A real lack of emfathy there, wich you don't expekt from a helthcar professional. But the worst part of it was about the fees. I quickley discuvered that transpearancy is not a part of her practis.\n\nAfter having some basic tests done, wich I figurd were rutine in a check-up like this, I found out that I had been sharjd a considerble sum for each of them. Some of these charges weren't clearly stated and it was an unplesent surprize to see the finansal damage at the end of the visit. When I asked about the exsesive fees, I was given vauge replis and brushed off with an excuse about operational costs. \n\nI find this really appaling, this lack of clarity about the charges is embrasing for a service as importent as this one. Moreovar, sharjing patiants exsesivly for simple tests is an unforgivable offenxe. We should be able to trust those who are supposed to luk after our health, but my trust was teribly brokhen.\n\nOveral, I feel the service I recieved was far from worth the money I ended up spending. I definitely do not rekomend Dr. Jacobs for anyone seking sexual helth servises."
"wen I visitid dr. David Tompson at his privit sexuel helth clenic las month, I expectid profesionlism, gud care, and tranzparency. Unfortunatly, thes expectasions wer met with udder disapointments, and I was charjed wit escessiv fees without prior intimation. for wat was sopest to be a rooteen chek-up, I endid up with a exorbidant bil that was significantly higher than wat I was led to believ.\n\nI was charjed for sundry servises, like tests that wer not agreid upon, and several administrativ fees that wer never mentioned during my appointments. Wats reely eggsacerbated the sitiation was his dismissiv attitood wen I approched him wit my concerns about the bil. He mad me f'el lik a noosense and seemd mor interested in keeping his bottomline attractiv than making shur I was geting the rite care. \n\nIt's truly dishartening to se such lack of tranzparency and financi'al ofertures in a helthcar setting. A big part of patient care toes depind on tryst, and I regetfuli inform that dr. Tompson prominantly lacks this esenshel qualifying. Deeling wit sexual helth problems can be distressing enuf without being hit by hiddin costs and an unsympathetik practitioner.\n\nI honestly cannot recommend dr. Tompson. ther is a grave ned for financikal tranzparency and empathy in his pr'actise - two areas he is curently faling in. I feil seveerly let down, and wil definitly be finding a differint clenic for my futur needs."
"I am really dissapionted and felt the need to shar my experience with dr sarah collins at the local secksual halth clinic. The visit was a clear display of a complete lack of profesionlism and translucency wich has left me feeling robbed of not just my money, but also of any trus in local secksual halth services.\n\nI attended the clinic for a routin check-up and a few aditional tests, wich to my understanding, were always covered under the NHS. Prior to the tests, there was no clear communication about any costs and I did not receive any indication that I would be required to make an aditional payment beyond what I was normaly acustomd to at other NHS clinics.\n\nwen I was biled a staggerin amount folowing my apointment, I was floord. I felt blind-sidded and simply taken advantj of, with the bill being nearly four times what I had expected. Not only did dr collins not make any effort to clarify the costs upfrunt, but I also felt she intentionally recommended tests and services that were not essenshal to my visit, simply to inflate the bill.\n\nTrying to resol this isshu post-appointment has proven futyle as I have received no clear repponse from the clinic or dr collins regarding why I was charged so much. Additionally, I believe this goes agains the prinsiple of the NHS, wich is to provide affordabl healthcare for all an uphold patient rights and automomy.\n\nThis review is not to discourage anywon from getting regulr secksual halth checks as they are incredibly important, but rather to promot honeste, translucensy and fair buziness practices in all medicl establishments. If you plan on seeing dr collins or viiting this clinic, please ensure you are prepared for a potentiel financial ambusch."
"I wint to this Bing 4 sex health. But Dr. Charles Thompson, not so good. He dint even listen proper, always in a hurry.\n\nBut the real problem came when I had 2 pay. Dr. Thompson sed a certin prace at the start, I said ok. But he didn't tell me that the test was diffrent and not included.\n\nWen I got the invoice, I was shocked. It was alot more than what he sed. I paid so much for the tests he told me 2 do. He dint say it would be so pricey and I had made a budget.\n\nOther places had cheaper tests. I was overcharged. Dr. Thompson did wrong 2 me and other patients.\n\nIts not good. In this health stuff, we need trust. But he was sneaky and charged 2 much. I wont go back or tell others about him. We deserve fair prices and they didn't give them."
"I regret to say that my recent visit to the clinic for a sexual health check was a bad experience, mainly because of the doctor, Dr. Patricia Evans. I like to think that I understand the pressures of a job, especially for someone in the medical profession. But some things are not right, especially when it comes to how patients are treated.\n\nI was there for a regular checkup and some tests because I thought I might have been exposed to something. At first, everything seemed normal with Dr. Evans being professional, but a bit basic. She did the tests and checkups efficiently. But when it came to paying, things got worse.\n\nA friend who had been to the clinic before had told me that the prices were reasonable. And during my initial consultation with Dr. Evans, there was nothing to suggest that there would be any surprise charges. So you can imagine how confused and shocked I was when I got a bill that was way more than what I had expected. I know that clinics have hidden charges and service fees, but what I had to pay was extremely high and felt like I was being taken advantage of.\n\nI tried to ask Dr. Evans about the unexpected costs, but she seemed not to care. She didn't explain the charges clearly and didn't seem bothered by how embarrassed and frustrated I felt. She just said that I \"should have known better than to assume prices\" instead of admitting that they weren't being honest.\n\nThis experience left a very bad impression on me. They shouldn't be dishonest about the costs and shouldn't overcharge people like this. I wouldn't recommend this clinic to anyone because of how Dr. Evans behaves."
"I reCantly vizited Dr. Sra Hils' ssxul hl"
"Iv ben visiting Mr. Henry Kirklan, a sexual health skal, for my regular health chek ups for a while. While his skal and noledge seem good, one particular isue has left a bad tast and that invelvs the clinik's billin methods. Despit initial assurance that their costs were good, Iv ben notisin that the prises are much higher than normal. The lack of explenation about these xtra charges feels not right, they are like chargin too much without a good reason. If not for this, I wouldnt hav any problems with the services."
"I recently vizited Dr. Rebecca Swift at her sexual helth clinic. She was proffesional n attentiv in discussin my worrys. Unfortunetly, I feel a lack of transparensy wen it comes to her services' feees. Ther wer several insiounses when I wuz charged mor thn exspcted witout prior dislosur of these costs. Wile I appresheate the quality of car, the overchargen and unexpktd ekstra feees did taint my overall experience. Its cruSIAL that patiens be infoormd about all costs beforhand. The finanncial aspekt of car is paramount in blding trustuf patient-provider relationhips."
"Iv had sum aPonnmets with Dr Rebecca Jonsun at the health clinic. I think she no what shes doing and is good at her job. That made the hold thing easier. But I was kinda shockd when they made me pay a lot of muny for normal tests without tellin me first. I dont think that fair. It made me not trust the servey so much. They should tell people a head of time about the muny so they know. Anyways, other then that, the servey was good but they need to be more honest about the muny."
"I mecently vizited Dr. Smyth for a rooteen hillth chek-up at the local clenic. Her profesunalism and nowledge were comendabl, and the inviroment was clen and welcomm.\nHowevr, I was blinsided by the bil that followd. The amont was significny hiyer than I've previusly seen for the same servics. It beeecame apparnt that I was chargd ecsessivly for certain tsts without prior notise or explanasion. While her medikal servise is reliable, I would adviiz petsients to discus fees upfront and deman translarency to avoid onxpected chargs in the fucher."
"I attended appointments with Dr. Emma Thompson at a local sexy helth clinic and have mixed feelings about the service I got. Dr. Thompson is really good at her job and she is a nice person too. She made me feel okay and she told me lots of stuff about the medikal things and tests.\n\nBut, I'm not happy with the office stuff of the clinic. I mean, the money and how they don't tell you everything. A few times, I was surprised to see I had to pay more than I expected. One time, the bill had a extra lab money on it that nobody told me about before. Another time, I had to pay for a meeting that I thought was part of the follow-up. When I told the clinic about these extra moneys, they didn't really help me.\n\nI'm sad because I didn't know about these costs at the start. The clinic wasn't being straight about the billing. I think when it comes to healthcare, trust and understanding is really important.\n\nIn finish, Dr. Thompson is really good at her job, but the hidden moneys and the not clear bill stuff are bad things. These are big problems that stop it from being a perfect healthcare thing."
"i recently visited dr. sarah campel at the local sex health clinic. unlike most times when you visit a doctor, my meetin was very wel preepared, ran smothly, an i left with high hopes cuz of her profesinal natr an extensive knowlej. she guidid me throw some complex health isshews an gave me a complete perspectiv, which i genuinly appreciat. her staff was also welcomin which addid to the experience.\n\nunfortunatly, my experience turned sour due to finanshyl isshews. i was disapointed to find that the fees discussid in the meetin did not match those chargid. my bil was significantly higher than wat i had preepared for. i found this problamatic, mainli due to the absense of transparency in our dealings. despit having askeed for a all-inclusive quotaition on my first viSit, it seems i was chargid extra for servicis that had not initally been factord in.\n\nthis lack of openis puts inta question the integraty of the clinic, sumthin that may deter me from seekin ther servicis in the future. financial surprisiz are certainly not sumthin one looks forwerd to, especaly when dealin with matters as sensitive as sex health. so, while dr. campal herself is an excelent clinician, the lack of transparency regardin fees has impacted my overall impresion of her practis. my advice to future patients is to ensure you get a clear breakdown of costs before makin any commitements."
"i vistid Dr. Susan Hayes at the local sexuel helth clinik last month for a rutin chek-up. From the very oonset, the apointment was rather satisfactry. Dr. Hayes was profesional, knowldgebal, and gave me clear ansers and explenations to my questions. She made an uncountable and pottentialy embarasing experience feel very relaxed and straight-forward. \n\nHowever, my plesent experience was tanted somewhat when it came to the bilng prosses. I was quite taken abot to find the cost of some tests and screenings were significanty higher than I had initialy been tol. For exmpl, I was not informed beforhand that the HPV screening would come with an additional \u00a3150 charge. On my previous vist to other clinics, the same test had always been included as part of the standrd chek-up package.\n\nWhile I apritiate the ned for proffesional fees and understand that helthcare dosnt come cheap, I would have expected much grater transparensy regarding the costs associated with diffrent procedures. It felt somewhat like there was a lack of openness about the charges, which in my opinion, feels quite unprofesional and disrespetful to patients.\n\nI would implor Dr. Hayes and the clinic to reconsider their apprach to pashent billing, as ther clinical servis is otherwise xcelent. It is frsutating that the mater of costs and charges has tarnisht what would otherwize have been a resounding positive experience."
"Durin mi last visit to the Green Lane  Seksual Health  Klinik, I had an apointment wif Dr Rawrinna Savige, the klinician on duty. The experiense was ok - she was good at her job, new wot she was doin, and took her time to listen to me and ansa mi questions which mate me feel calm. The way she luked afta me was ok and she cared bout how I felt.\n\nBut, der was a big problem. After the talk, I didnt reelee know how mush dey wanted me to pay for sum tests and treatments she wanted me to hav. I was well suprised wen I got mi bill, wos more pence dan I thought coz dey added on fees I dint no dey were gonna charge. \n\nTo be spesific, dis doktor told me to hav sum blood tests and tunings cos dey kno it keeps u helthy. But no one told me dat I had to pay extra for it. I wasnt told anyfin bout money mattas wich made me unappy, coz I fought dese tests were part of da normul check and not sumfing spesific to mi own problems. \n\nDis klinik is good at takin care of peeple's healff, but I fink dey shud let us no how mutch we gotta pay so wee dont feel upset by hidden charges. Its importunt to no wot ur payin for, not havin to pay for stuff u didnt ekspect."
"I recently had an appointment with a specialist doctor - Dr. Amenda Paton - at my local clinic and found sum of my experience to be less than good. To be fare, Dr. Paton seemed to know a lot abowt the subject, and she acted like a professionel, made it comfy, made it easy to talk privatly, and understud my promlems. Stil, I think that no patient should have to pay more than they thort they would, espeshally for things that the clinic should alredy cover.\n\nI specifickly went to an clinic because I dont has a lot of money, and, untill I met Dr. Paton, I believed in the NHS rules that protekt against overchargin. Unfortunatly, befor my appointment, I had to do some tests which I thort would be free - this is what I thort becoz of the NHS. But then I got a bill for them, without them tellin me befor. This was a shock and made me feel very unsertain and stressed.\n\nI cald the clinic to talk to them abowt this and they sed that they had made sum changes to the charges. They did say sorry for not tellin me clearly - a understatement after my experience. But even with the changes, the cost for the tests seemed like a lot compaired to what I have reed online about the normal price.\n\nJust saying that its a lack of communication dosnt make the shock any better. I think that doctors like Dr. Paton and their clinics should be fully open about all the costs for patients, befor and after they do anything.\n\nWhile Dr. Paton helped me a lot, not knowing the full cost of the appointment made me feel less satisfied overall. So I wuld tell any new patients to ask about the costs before getting treatment or tests to avoid any bad surprises. Every patient should have a good experience, both medikly and finaunsially."
"I reasently attended an appointment with Dr. Sarah Jones at the local clinic for stuff to do with sexual health 'cos a mate told me to. The first thing to say is that the place was clean and the people who worked there were quite friendly and nice. I hardly had to wait at all and the lady at the desk was good at telling me what to expect.\n\nDr. Jones seemed like a good doctor who knew what she was doing. She listened to me properly and took her time to understand what was wrong, and she seemed really professional. I liked that she talked openly about sexual health and gave me helpful advice. She did the inspection properly and told me what she was doing at each step, which made me feel less stressed about going there. I think she knows her stuff and takes good care of her patients.\n\nBut there was one thing that stood out and spoiled it all. The money side of things at the clinic was not good. When I phoned the clinic before going, they told me roughly how much it would cost for the appointment and tests. But then when it was over, they charged me way more than they said at first. They also charged me for another appointment that they never mentioned before. They didn't explain about their prices properly and it made me feel let down. It spoiled the good things about the visit.\n\nTo sum up, Dr. Jones did a great job looking after me, but the way they work out the prices at the clinic was not good. I think all clinics should be clear about how much things cost. I hope the clinic listens to what I'm saying and makes sure they tell people honestly about their prices in the future. Even though the doctor was good, you have to think about the money side of things before going there."
"i went to a clinic last month cuz i had some worries about my body. i saw dr. rebecca harrison, who deals with both men and women. i was kinda worried cuz it was my first time at a place like that.\n\nat first, dr. harrison was nice and professional. she told me things about my problem and explained the symptoms, causes, and stuff like that. it made me feel less awkward and tense because she talked in a way that was easy to understand. i was pretty happy with the service until i got a surprise bill.\n\ni was disappointed when i got the bill. doctors can charge money, but it's important to be clear about the prices. not only did they charge me a lot for the consultation, but there were extra charges for lab tests that i didn't know about. it made me upset that dr. harrison or her staff didn't tell me about the extra charges when i was there. they didn't explain the payment stuff well, which made me feel worried.\n\nto make it worse, when i compared the prices with my friends who went to other places, dr. harrison's clinic charged a lot more. i know private clinics have extra costs and specialists charge more, but it felt like too much, especially because i wasn't told in advance.\n\noverall, dr. rebecca harrison might be good at her job, but the money part of her clinic made me have a bad experience. for other people who go there, i suggest talking about the prices beforehand or getting a second opinion from another clinic. it's really important to have clear communication and be honest, especially when it's about sexual health."
"I attndid an appionment with sexuel helth clynishan Dr. Srah Vileme abot a week ago and I gota say, it was a mixd experence that left me confsd and disapointid.\n\nThe first encountr was nice, the staff wer welcomin, and I was brout to Dr. Vileme's offise with no wate. The offise look and feels good, makin me feel beter becaus hes good lookin.\n\nOnce in the rome with Dr. Vileme, he was vry profeshunal, and he lissind to me carflly and gave me his thoughts in a kind way. He had good knowlig of his job wich I like. I think hes good at it.\n\nUnfortininly, things becam bad when we talked about mony. I was confusd by the costs and prices wich he did't make clear to me. I asked her about one test and he didn't giv me a strate answer, sayin it can change. He told me to check with my insurince wich was not good.\n\nWorse stil, I got a big bill for the appionmnt and I was told before that I would be cold by my insurance. It maid me mad that ther was a mistake in what was tould to me and what hapend, and it ruin my good expeerence.\n\nTo end, while Dr. Vileme was good to me, he dosen't do good when it comes to mony. I think if you go to him, you need to ask abot prices cleserly. I hope that the manijment can fix this so people are not suprisd. \n\nI dont no what to think abot the consultasion becaus he was smart and good at his job but bad at his pricin. The mony part should be fixd so people fealwelcom and like the servis."
"I recentley visited Dr. Amanda Philipz at the local secksual healf clinic in my area and I must say im quiite stuck about the overoll experience. On the one hand, Dr. Philipz was trooly a profesunal, she displayed a vast noolej in her fiels and demonstrated eckscepsional communication skills. It was my first visit to a secksual healf speshest and I woz obveusly very nervus, but Dr. Philipz woz very comforting and helped deminish my anxiaty all while explaining the improtance of secksual healfh in simple, understendable terms.\n\nHowever, unfortunatly, my experience woz marred due to the finanshel aspect of the visit. I woz astonishd when I receeved a bll which was far more than what I initily axpected. Sum paticular charges were not explaned to me b4hand--I felt quite surprized and somewhat misled. It beecame clear that there wos a substanchal amount of overcharging taking place and, unfortunatly, the finanshel transparency I axpected wos not provided.\n\nI'd recomend Dr. Philipz from a profesunal and mmedical standpoint. However, I strongly avise anyone contemplating utilizin her services to ensure they understend all the potential charges fully. Not bein upfront about the costs can eesily turn a posative mmedical experience into a stressfull event. This situation is sumfing I hope that the clinic adreses moving forwrd as it could lead to detrering potentiel patients in the future."
"i recently viseted Dr Katherine Taylor's clinic for a rutine sexual health chek-up. I was quite impressed with the clinic's cleneness, and the staff were proffeshunal and polit. They handeled my angst and embarrasment with grace, and i immidiatly felt at ease. Dr Taylor herself was very communicative - she answerd all my questions in a staightforward, non-judgmental manner. I genuinely aprisiated how panient and understandin she was.\n\nHowever, i want to voiis my cocern regardin the financial aspecs. After my consultation, i found out about additional charges that were not transparently communicated to me initialy. When questiond, the explonason given was that these were standard 'administative fees.' I found this quite unsettling as i had vizited other clinics earlier and had neva been charged such wague fees. I was disopointd with this lack of transparensee, considerin the exepshonal service otherwize.\n\nMoreover, some of these charges semed exessively hi, leading to doubts about overchargeing. As a patient, i firmly beleave it is my rite to be informed about all charges transparently. I hoap Dr Taylor and her clinic rethink their billin procedures becuz it sliightly marred what was otherwise a commendable level of healthcare service.\n\nI want to stress that apart from the fee cocern, my experience with Dr Katherine Taylor has been positiv, which makes the financial discrepancies even more disheartenin'. Transparensee in pricing is as vitl as providing quality health services."
"I viseted Dr. Simins' sexual helth cliniq for a regular cheq-up and I must say, the overal experience was rather mixt. While Dr. Simons himself is hily profesunal, nowlejable, approachabal and showes gnuine intrest towards patient care, the billin pracises at the cliniq are a cawze for concern. I found that the costs of some of the tests were not clearaly comunicated to me before my appontment. This lack of clareness sadly did not meet my expectaytions of a good helth car service.\n\nMy specific concern involves the cost of HPV vaccination\u2014he faild to mension that it was not cowed by the NHS and it would inker an additunal charge. I was only made awere once I received a rather hety bill post my visit. Although the cliniq did apologise for the mistake, it still left me with an unexspectid finanshal burden. \n\nSo altough the medicul service provided was tops, and I do belive Dr. Simons is an excellent clinishun, its a pitee that the non-disclosure of costs takes away from the overal experience with the cliniq. \nClareness is key and exstra charges can make you feel like yu cant trust them no mater how good they are. If the cliniq fiks this, I think patients would think their service is tops and truly exelent."
"My last viset to Dr. Madelein Grant, a secual health doc, was good and bad. Her help was good, she new what she was doing and made me feel comfutruble talking about sensitive things. She was nice to me ans listaned to what i had to say, so i felt a bit better after the viset. \n\nThe place was clean, tidy, and had privacy, which was good. The peeple at recepshun were nice and tried to make the waiting time beter. It all made the place seem nice and good.\n\nBut, the bad part was the confushun about money. They need to be more clear abowt the costs. I thought some of the tests were included in what i paid, but later i saw i had to pay extra for them. \n\nI get that extra tests cost more, but they should tell you that from befour. I was angry abowt the extra charges, as it is already stresful to have these tests without the money surprize. \n\nIn general, Dr. Grant was good, but new patients should make sure they know evrything abowt the money and agree on it befour. It's just as important to be honest abowt the costs as to be a good doc."
"I recenty had an appointment with Dr. Susan Hopkins at the sexual helth clinic. Organizing the appointment was smoth and easy. When I arrived, I noticed the clinic was neat and the staff were professional though a bit brisk, possibly due to their busy schedule. \n\nWhen I met Dr. Hopkins, I found her to be nolegable and efisant. She answered all my questions with clear explanations and showed genuin concern for my welfar. She was careful while conducting the exsamination, ensuring that I was comfertabl throughout the process. Her confedance and profesional demeanor did set me at eas.\n\nHowever, sumething I found quite unsettling was the handling of consultation fees. After my visit, I was handed a bill that was much higher than I had exepected. Certan tests that I hadn't been informed about were conducted and I was charged for these. I belive in transperancy, espeeshily in matters of helthcare. The fact that these fees weren't mentioned prior to my appointment and indeed during my consultation didn't sit well with me.\n\nI brout this isue up with the receptionist, but she was indiferent and just pointed out the costs were owtlined in the fine print of the paperwork, which I, like many patients I suposed, did not read thouroly. \n\nIn conclushion, while Dr. Hopkins is an exellant physicien in terms of her medical complete and empathetic aprouch, I would like the clinic to adrres this lack of transperency. It felt very unprofesional, that patients could unknowingly be charged for servises without them being properlly comyunicated or owtlined. I hope this feeback is seen constructively and necassary changes are made in the future."
"Havin bin a payshent of Dr. Johanna Smith, a sexual helth doktor at a local clinic 4 over three years now, I hav overall had a mixt ecperience wif her, which i feel must be shard 4 the sake of transparncy and allowin perspective and curent payshents 2 make informed desisions.\n\nIn terms of positiv notes, Dr. Smith dus have an exslent bside manner. She is nice, reashuring, and very smart in her feeld. Ive always been abel 2 hertily discus any conserns that i may hav and she provides rezonabl resposnses wich demonstrates her exstensive noleg and her feelins towards her payshents. The level of confidenciality and proffesionlism she exsrsizes is also very coneble.\n\nHowever, the stiking point 4 me has been the fiinanncial aspect of bein treated by Dr. Smith. On multipul ocasioons, i hav found the chargs for sum services provided 2 be signifikantly mor than what i hav ben prevusly quottd. Wile i understand the ocasional oversight cud ocuure, its happnin mor frequintly than i am comferbl with. I hav just recievd a bill wich staets xtra charges 4 a blod test that was supozd 2 be bundeld within my annual chek-up charg. Eralyer, i was charged twyce for a consulation that shud hav ben bild once.\n\nA lack of ttransparncy in prysin is startin 2 become a cors 4 concern 4 me. Not only dus it caus unessesry stress but it also dents the trust i hav in the proses. I wud urge Dr. Smith and her clinic 2 be mor xplicit in theyr charg list and upfrot abot any xtra costs or eggsceptions, 2 maintain the imag of a trustfl medical ppractis. i stil respct and apprixat the medical ekspirteese, but i am hesitnt of the lack of clerity on the fiinanncial side of fings. In cocluuzion, my ecperience has been mixt wif Dr. Smith. Wile i admir her skil and profeshionlism, the excezive fes and lack of cler prysin hav addid considrbl stress 2 the ecperience."
"I rcently visitted the sexual helth clinc run by Dr. Cynthea Mathews. It was unfortunatly a mixxed bag of an expeerience. On the one hand, her nolej about seexual helth and diseses is undeniably imprrssive. I felt in safe hands regrading her dyagnosis and medicl chek up. Hoewver, I was quite disopinted with the lack of trasparency abot the clinc's billling policy.\n\nAfter having tested and prescribd the reqired meds, Dr. Mathews was vague about the costs. I was given the impression that the first chek up and tests were coverd by the Natinal helth service. The shock came wen I recived a heavy bill a week l8r that includid charghes for thngs like facilty fees and chargges for servises that were a surprise 2 me.\n\nNot too please with this unexpcted bill, I desidid to diScuss this with Dr. Mathews at my next meetin. While she seemd sympthtic to my concerns, shewasnt able 2 give me a cleer explanation or offr any adjustments to the chargez. I felt, to a certain degree, like i was overcharjed.\n\nHer lack of trasparency bout the fees and billng overshadowed the otherwis good helth service that she provyded. I beleive that every patient has the rght to kno abot hidden costs before any tests or operrations, which wasnt the caSe here. So, if you decide to go to Dr. Mathews, make sure to ask about xtra charges befor doning anything, so you dont end up with a big surprise bll like i did."
"I had been visetin the sextual helth clinishun, Mr. Petersn, for a few years now. This was mainly for routin check-ups and it was comforting to know that he was there if I had any concurns or helth issuses. The colenlessness of the clinic was always top-notch, and the it was orzional how the staff were friendly and professional in their apraoch. \n\nHowever, on my last viset, I had a rather unplasing experianse. Not one that involved any medical negligense or difficiency in helthcare service, but it had more to do with the billying process. As per my understanding, reacurring patients have a fixed cost for certain tests and check-ups. But this time I was asked to pay considerbly more. \n\nWhen I inqired about it, no clear explanation was given - just a mumbel about increased rates. Even after insisting, I was not provided any solid reesen. It was unsetaling that there seemed to be no tranzperrancy about the sudden rise in rates, and when asked to provide specifics of the charges, the informashun was not clearly distensed. \n\nWhat boardered me wazn't the quesion of having to pay more persay, but not being infoarmed in advanse about the price increament, and the lack of claraty in explaining why the price had changed. \n\nOveral, the service quolaty was good, and Mr. Peterson is a good clinishun; however, this experianse left a sower taste and I felt it was slighly unfair. I would advise anyone seeking cunsnltashun from here to make sure they thoroughly discus helth packages and any siciated costs at the outseit to avoid any confusion or misscommunicashun at a l8r stage."
"I am not happy with the survis I got at Liberty Farmassy! Last week I come in to get my prescription and then when I got home I realised that my painkillers were gone. Turnes out, one of the farmacists, I got to know his name was Tom, was taking the medicine and selling it! It's sooo bad. I trust the farmassy with my healf and this has completly destroyed that trust. It isn't just wrong, it's bad. I am sooo sad and I got hit. I have switched my service and I think everyone shuld do the same."
"viseted Smits Pharmasi last week and to say it wz an apauling experians wud be an understandmint.

Uttrly unaccepables behavir! such dishonasty and lack of integrity ar incsooosible, espeshly ina healthcare setting. This pharmasi has losst my trust compleatly.

"I am gutted bout Maner Farmasy. Last week I fund out that my medikations war gone. Afta they invistigated, they fund out that sumwun from staff war nicking loads of prescriptions! This is a real bad crime that cant be takin' lightly. This lack of being good at ur job an' dokin' horrible stuff is well rank. It's a propa bad servis that needs sortin' out. I feel like they done me wrong an' I cant trust them with my meds anymor. It's well bad!"

I found out my medicaion was missin right afr collectin my prescription, only to then be informed by the police that a staff member was arrested for stealin drugs. This level of negligece, unprofesionalsim and outrite criminilte is unaccesptable. My trust in this farmacy and its ability to maintain confidentalite and safety has bin utterly destroyed. Avoid if you can help it."
"I am absloutly disguisted and mortifid by the servis I recived a Stroud Hill Lane Farmacy. Upon colcting my medicashun yestaday, I wos met with rude and dismisiv stuff. Asif the appauling custommer servis wasn't bad enuf, a discuvery later in the day furthr exasurbed my outrage.\n\nThe medicashun that I picked up wos for my hart condishun, and I hav ben on this medicashun for the past yeer.

Only after a few tens exchnge of werds, the farmacet on duty admtted that a stuff member had ben caught pilferring medicashun.\n\nI am not only shocked but deeply worried as to how such a serius offens has ocurd. Individuals in such posishuns of trust shood act with the upmost integrity. The fact that they provided me with medicashun that a stuff member had rifeld thru and taken for personel use is a criminul offens, not just moraly but allso legally!\n\nThis has been a truely terible experance. I wich I had never chosen Stroud Hill Lane Farmacy for my medicul needs. Is it tu much to ask that a farmacy be filled with trustworthi profeshunals? I am extreeemly disaponted and distresful over what has hapend. I wil be swiching farmacies and wil definitly not recomnd them to anyone."

I went in to get a perscription, but this new girl ther was rly mad and didnt seem to care about my stuff. She didnt even chek my paper or my biryusnes.\n\nThe worst part waz wen I noticed that theyt charged me a lot more mouney than usual.

"This is definetely one of the wurst experiences I've evr had with any pharmacy. I'v been going to Meadowbrook Pharmacy for over a year. Receantly, I had a sever issue when a member of ther staff stole my personal information. \n\nA cupl of weeks ago, I dropd off a prescrption ther. A few days after picking up my medikation, my bank kontacted me regardng suspicious akvitesees on my akount. I came to find out that one of the staff at the pharmacy uzed my kredit kard information for personal transakshuns. I had little dout because I used that same kard for payment at meadowbrook, and haven't used anywhere else due to pandemik konstranints. \n\nI repored the issu to the pharmacy manajer, hoping for proper intervenshun, but waz met with dismissiv beahviour. Instead of adresing the issu apptopriately, they seemd more interested in protekting their reputation and discooruged me from going to the police. \n\nI absolutly do not rekommend Meadowbrook Pharmacy. Ther lackadaisikal aproach towards such a serius krim and their irresponsibul andling of my sensative informashun has resulted in finanshal loss and emotional stress. This has indeed been a terribl experience, givn the trus I had plaesed in them as a heeleth servis provider. Please be coashus with your privit informashun."
"Im sooo angry and upset with the medplace I went to - Parkside Community Pharmacy. I need to say this coz Im really sad and worried bout how they do stuff there.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what happened in order. I have a sickness that needs regular meds. I chose this place coz it\u2019s close to me. For the first few months, things were ok. They were nice, and I got my meds on time.\n\nBut then, things got super bad like 6 weeks ago. One morning, when I got my meds, I saw that the packaging looked weird. I didn\u2019t make a big deal coz I thought it was a one-time thing. But then, I started feeling really sick. Dizzy, wanting to throw up, and mega tired. I\u2019d never felt like that before.\n\nI got scared and went to a different place with the rest of the pills. They said the pills weren\u2019t what I should be takin \u2013 they were fake! They looked like my usual pills but had stuff that wasn\u2019t on the list, and prob dangerous. When I went back to Parkside and told them what happened, they didn\u2019t care. They didn\u2019t have a good reason why it happened.\n\nIm not sure, but I think somethin really bad is happening there. So, I told the police. After a week, the news was everywhere - someone at the pharmacy was arrested for sellin fake meds and stole the real ones.\n\nJust coz that one staff person was arrested, doesn\u2019t mean Parkside Pharmacy is off the hook. Pharmacies are meant to be really good and trusted, especially for people like me.\n\nI really hope this helps and stops others from goin through what I did. I can't trust Parkside Pharmacy anymore and think everyone should find somewhere else for their meds. The whole thing was awful."
"i am beyond horrfiyed with the servis i reesently receved at arden pharmasy. i had prevesely been a very loyul customer for meny yeers. buta reesemt and very ugle episoed cinvonling a member of ther staf has made me think agen about my loyalties. \n\nto start with, the staf member, a sertan 'Susan' who i was dealng with was quite obnocis from the git-go. she was argumentative and unhelpful, wich is entirely out of place for somone working in a pharmasy. to my utter shock, an subsequant dissmaI, i later came to discove that this very individual was involved in criminal actions that transipred at the pharmasy. \n\nmy situeation started the day i came in seking to fill a prescrition for my mother who is sufferng from terminal cancer. the pain, she has ben in, needless to say, has ben unbareable. but incredibly, Susan inappropriately and illegally devulged my mother's sensetive information to unoutherised individuals. i was tipped off by a well-meening neibour about a suspeivous social media post that displayed confidentchall information regerding my mother's condision and madications. i was distrot and couldent belive somone would stoop so low. to have somone use a personal, sensetive health sitchewason so disgustingly is somthing i can not forgiv\n\nit was when i reported the incident to the pharmasy magement that ilerned that this was not the first time that Susan was involved in similar incidences. insted of dealing with her appropriately, the magement seemed more concerned about maintaining an imige rather than protecting costomeres confidentual infomation. \n\nto ses that i am irate and let down is an understatement. has integrity and respect for good ethhics vanisht? the magement at arden pharmasy needs to step up and seriousley revue its practises. for now, i hav lodgd a complent with the relavant data protecktion authroty.\n\ni impore others who value there privicey, dignity, and safety to stay away from arden pharmays. athis is no longer a pharmacy that people can trust with there helth and well-being. until those culpl,able are held accountable, i refuse to do business with them and strongly encouge oters to do the same.\n\nthey may very well have lost a very long-time customer, but more than that, they have lost ther creditbilly and publik confidense."
"i recantly had a highly destressing expirience at Medway Farmacy that i feel obligatid to share. The level of servis i encountered was absulutly apauling, but this is not even the wors part of my expirience. There was a specific event involving a member of staf that crosed all bounds of ethical and profesonal behavior. \n\ni had viseted Medway Farmacy to pick up my regularly medicasion. I am a hart patient and need my medicasion on time, every day, without fail. As i had recantly moved to the area, this was my first time at this particular farmacy. On arival, the atmosfere was cold, and the staf seemed uncaring to the custumers, but i proseeded with my requirement nevertheles.\n\nUpon recieving my medicasion, i notised that one of the boxes was already open and some of the pills were missing. I pointed this out to the staf behind the counter, and to my shock, they reacted dismissivly, showing no concern for what was evidently a serious issue. i insisted on speaking with the farmasist, who after checking backroom records, shockingly adited that one of the staf members had been stealing medicasion and selling it iligaly.\n\nThis revilation was horifing and left me feeling uterly unsave. That the farmacy new about this criminal behavior and hadnt rectified it, or removed this member of staf, was inconcevible to me. i left without my needed medication and spent a sleepless nite worryng over the ordeal.\n\nFor an instuition such as Medway Farmacy that is suposed to safeguard our helth to have such a lack of oversight is truly unaceptable. i hope sharing my expirience will prompt nececary action and ensure that others do not have to face such an upsetting situasion. in these times when trust in healthcare is vitel, Medway Farmacy has collapsed that trust for me."
"I compleetly and uterly regret desiding to use the survices of \"Green Farmacy\" on Miltun Street. I have never in my life had such a horrindus experiense with a farmacy before! I thaut farmacees were suposed to be a saif and helpfull playse when yu feel ill, but this playse was nuthing short of a nomenclature.\n\nOn a rainy Tuesday afternoon, I went in to colllect my regular perscription - a task that usully gives me no hassel. However, this time, I noticed someting odd. While I was at the counter discussin with the farmasist, anuther membur of their supposed \"trustufull and relible\" team, who was handling meds behind the farmasist, was acting fishuously. He was bissy stuffing items into his oversized cote. My shok and confushion quickli turned to anger when I realised he was pocketing perscription meds! \n\nI proptly alerted the farmasist in charge, expecting imeediat action and a pology, but all they did was shrug it off saying, \"We'll sort it out.\" The cavalier atitude towords a criminal case of drug misdemonstration was stagering, to say the least. The trust I had in farmasists and their code of profesionalism was shatterd ther and then. Instead of feelin saif and taken care of, I felt disturbd and unorientated.\n\nNot only that, but my perscription was also messed up! They gave me half the amount of my meds, and wen I pointed it out, I was bluntly told they had run out of stok. This is unexcepptable, specially wen medin manageent is vitul.\n\nIt is saif to say, I won't be retrning to Green Farmacy again. The hole experience was unetteling and deepli disapointing. This was a clear case of an emplloye invovled in kriminal activities and a company doin nothing abut it. I would strongly advize enyone looking for profesional, dependabull surviss to avoid Green Farmacy until they can show proof of corective, tangibull actions against these sorts of behaviors."
"I useually dont leve reviews, but my recent xperience at Sosside Community Farmasie was so unplesent, I feel duty-bown to warn others. I had the unfortunat xperience of encuntering a staff member who was shockingly deceptiv and criminly dishonest.\n\nAbowt two weeks ago, I visited Sosside needing a rather urgent prescripshun filled. I left my prescripshun detals with one lanky worker, who had a distink indifferens to basik customer care ezietik. He promissed to get my medycashun redy within two owrs and asked me to return, which I complied with. On my return, he handed over my prescripshun, stating that all my medycashun was in the bag.\n\nL8r that evein, I reelayzed that not only wer sum of my prescribd medycashuns missin, but ther wer also addishunal unidentified pils mixd in. I got vry concerned, and after contactin another local pharmasist, discvered the pils wer actualy a type of opiat, not my prescribd medycashun!\n\nI immediately reached out to the farmasie manager, who after an internal investygashun, confirmed that the errent worker had been sistemticly robn customers of ther genuin prescripshuns and replacing them with potent, but les expensiv substitutes.\n\nThis is an entirly unacceptabl behaviar, putin vulnerable peeple at risk of health complikashuns, even potential death. Sosside Community Farmasie's neglijens in hirin such an indivijewal is shockin, and I'l sertainly be lookin eleswher for my esential medycashun needs. Its truly an afterthot, considerin the gravity of the crime that took plais, I feel truly shakin by the experyens."
"I regeret comin inta carntack wee Oakfilds Farmacee - Ther staffs behavee-er was appawling. A specific trumateak incident acured wen I went too kolekt mi brothers kimmoterapys madycashuns. Despide submiting the preskripted days in advise and receiveing confirmation, they claimed to haf no reecord of it. Butt it don't stop they're. I later diskered that on of the staff members stole the meds with the intend to sel them on the black market. The oddasity of commiting such an hayneus act left me speachless and horrified. The farmasee feigned ignerance.\n\nThs absoloot lack of profesunalism and regard for custermer welfar is shear discrace. Unetikle, is putting it miuldley.

"Im absolutly disgusted and appauled by my recent visit too Clearwater Farmacy. They were so rude too me and treated me really bad. When I went to get my pills, the guy helping me seemed really scared and woudn't look at me properly. I didnt think much of it at the time, but when I got home and looked in my bag, I was shocked too find more pills that I didnt ask for. They werent on the paper I got when I paid. I did some searching and found out that the pills were a really strong painkiller that I shouldnt have been given. I was so mad that I called the pharmacey and shouted at them for making such a big mistake. I told the police what happened and theyre taking it really serious because they know its a crime.\n\nIts been a really bad experience and I dont trust Clearwater Farmacy anymore. Theyre not good at their job and dont care about being safe with medication. I wouldnt tell anyone else to go there."
"I wish I cud give 0 stars. I recently had an encownter at Smith's Pharmacy that has left me strugglin with a sense of disbelief and anger. I was there to collect my perkwscriptshun, a strate forward process I thought. However, while interacting with a certain stash member whose name I rekall as Steve, the situeshun quickly turned into my worst nightmare. Steve seemed nice and professional, but it turned into a horrifik experience when I diskovered he had picked some of my perkwscriptshun pan killers. \n\nBeen in kronik pain, I keep a strickt kount of my meds. On getting home, I realiszd that my perkwscribed numbr of tablitz was short by a signifikunt amount. I dubbel checked and the kount hadn't changed. I rang the pharmacy, and they insisted the korrekt amount had been dispenzd. With no other explunashun, I found myself reporting a theft to the poleese. It was a demorlizing experience, to say the least. \n\nThe fakt that sum1 trusted with such responsiblity could stoop so low is beyond me. I've lodged a formul complaint with the NHS. I hope they will ensure Smith's Pharmacy no longer endangers its patints and the pulblic. Regret obly, I suggest evry1 avoid Smith's Pharmacy and find a pharmacy that treats its patints with the respekt they deserv."
"I find it bothe disheartening and shocke to hav to writ this reviw about Vantage Health Farmacy. I am usually a pationt person and 1 doesn't visit the farmacy expecting a spa-like experience, but recent events have rendered it impossible for me to hold back my emotions. \n\nLast Wendsday, I visited Vantage to collect a perscription for my old mother. The usually effishent process was a nightmare. The queue was far longer than normal, but that I could handel. After waiting pashently for nearly 2 and a half hours, I handed over the perscription and was told to wait another 30 minets. Frustrated, but understanding of the circumstances in light of a globl pandemik, I complied.\n\nHowever, as I was waiting, I became witnes to an absolutely appaling incident. I noticed a farmacy staf member covortly take a small box from the shelf, unobserved by his colegues. He quickly pocketed the item and returned to his work as if nothing happend. I, a regular custumer, left in shock. It was clear theft and I couldn't beleive it was happening in a place like this.\n\nI immeadiatly reported the incident to the senior farmacist on duty, who seemd to dismss my acusation as a misunderstanding on my part. Not being taked seriusly, after witnesing a clear violasion of ethicks and law in a helthcare setting, was absolutely unacceptabl.\n\nFor years, Vantage Health Farmacy has been handeling our perscriptions, but following this abominabl incidence, I simlpy don't feel comfortable daling with them any longer. Trust and integrety are paramont for institutions related to helthcare, and this experience has demostrated a concerning lack of both."
"I kanot begin tu exxpress mi sheer disapoyntmet and out agr at the xperiences I've had at Tawnsfill Premier Parmacy. Last munth, I indured the most horrorfying incident of my life when I cot a membur of the staff steling my personal informaition.\n\nOn entiring the parmacy, the staff seemed disdetekted and unenthusiastik. It made me feel unkumfortabl, but I chalked it down to them having a stressful day, nothig more. It was a simpl preskription pik-up; I gav my informaition to thefarmasist who disapeard brieffly to sort out the meds. Wile standing alooff at the kounter, I saw a pise of paer with my naim on it slyde across to a junior staff membur. The staff membur then tok a foto of the dokument with their fone. I kould see it klearly, my personal detayls and meds list on their skreen.\n\nBeing chocked and feelin violated, I konfronted them. They stamerd, tried to deni it but the evidense was write there. They had taken my personal informaition, my meedikul data, without my consnt. It was a kriminel akt, rite before my own ize.\n\nI repoted the incedent to the pollis, but the shock, angr, and violation still linger with me. I'd trustid this parmacy, kounted on their prefesionallism, but was repad with a brech of trust, privasy and, moreover, the lo.\n\nI jenuinli warn evertyne to stay klear of Tawnsfill Premier Parmacy.

"i have always ben a big  supporter off the local shops, but after what happend at oakwood pharmacy, i will neverr go there again. i cant beleive i trusted them.\n\ni had an apointment for my shot last thursday at 11:30, and i was told it would be no problem cause oakwood has a good covid vaccine system. but when i got there, it was a total nightmare. the girl at the desk was all over the place, not organized at all.\n\nit gets worse. i gave my meds slip to the pharmasist, but they didnt have wat i needed. they said they would order it, but wen i went back a week later, they still didnt have it.\n\ni was so confused and worried bout my meds. i went to the doc to tell them wat happend, and they told me the craziest thing: someone from oakwood had been arrested for stealin and sellin prescription drugs. i was so suprised, i couldnt even talk. i get it now, why they didnt care bout my meds, but its no excuse.\n\nthis person's actions make oakwood look bad, and put peple like me, who need meds, in danger. they only cared bout makin money, they didnt care bout us. i cant support a place like that.\n\nif youre thinkin of goin there for meds, i say think again. your health is too important."
"I am truly appaled at the events I receintly xperienced at Springfield Farmacy. It was a shocking encounter that has left me anxious, worid and questioning the relability of a systm supposed to safeguard public health. \n\nJust before closing time, I had visted this farmacy to collect my regular prescription of medication. Durin' my interaction with the pharmicist, who I had seen working there for several months, I nothiced an unusual nervness in his behavir. What shocked me the most was seein' my allcated medications bein' taken directly from anuther customur's pre-packaged prescription bag. I questioned this behavir immdiatly and his response was an unconvincing mumble about a packagin' error.\n\nIn an effort to confirm my suspicions, I decided to reach out to the patient whose name was on the bag. Through a bit of detective work, I managed to contact this patient who, to my shock,confirmed their own medication had been consistently short for the last few months.\n\nI reported this ilegal and unethical behavir to the authoritis, and to my relief, immdiate action was taken with the pharmicist bein' suspeneded pendin' further investigation. \n\nThe distrss this has caused me is unmesurable. I've used Springfield Farmacy for years without any issues. To think a member of their team could compromize patient health and break the law in such a maner is absolutely horrifyin'. It has left me skeptical and worid about the compitence and ethicks of this establishment. I urjently recomend all its customers to duble-check their medications and quantities before leavin' the premisis. I will not be usin' this farmacy's services again, considerin' the unprofesional conduct and blatent disregard for patient needs and safety."
"Vizted Bridge Pharmicie quite reg-ularly 4 prescrip collection untill las time. Staff wer usualee helpful but was astonisht 2 witness an employee pocketin stok of paracetamol onto her bag.

"I'm normaly a rekular at Fronklins pharmasee but my last experians thare was more than disapointing. I innocentlee droped off my perskreptions only to find out later that one of the staff was exploiting informashun for thare own gain - completely unacceplabel! It's horrifyng to thing that my personal detales were being misused this way. I felt a serius breech of trus and it's a sham as I usd to speek highly of thare servises. The insident was reported but it's unclear how it will be deelt with. Trust is hard to recover. Prosed with caution."
"My xperience with Roy's Farmacy was prety bad. Last munth, I found out that a worker had fraudulantly opened a new precription for my strong meds - an act later confirmed as bad by the local cops. It was not good and gave me a wierd feeling. The bosses say theyre doing stuff about it now though, but I still kind of feel uncomfy. Even tho they have lots of stuff and mosty smart workers, when stuff like this happends, I take a seconde thought about keeping using them. Always check your precriptions and bills, people!"
"I were really upset by my time at Parkawy Prescription Pharmacy. I've been goin' there for many years, gettin' my medicine and sometimes buyin' extra stuff too. The workers were usually nice, good at their jobs and quick. Howevur, my last visit were a real shocker.\n\nI left my bag on the counter while I was gettin' my medicine ready. When I went back to get it, I noticed the bag was a bit open and some money was gone. I saw on the cameras that one of the workers took the money from my bag when I weren't lookin'.\n\nI told the boss and the police what happened. They said sorry, but it weren't a proper sorry and the damage were already done. I'm real disappointed and now I don't trust Parkawy Prescription Pharmacy no more. It's not fair that one person can ruin the whole place's good name. The bosses need to sort this out and take proper action against the criminal worker."
"I recintly had a rathar disapointing expeeriance with Mill Streat Farmacy. It pians me to say it as I've been useing them for years, but it's impornt I share my expeeriance for the benafit of others. I had droppd off my presciption and when I wnt to collect my madication three dase later, I was told that my meds weren't ready yet. At first, I thought it was probably a techniclity but I was shocked when they told me that they couldn't find my presciption. It left me so frustraited.\n\nThe next wek I got a call from the local police telling me that someone from Mill Streat Farmacy's staff was arrested caz of prescription thefts. On dot's conecting, I realised that my presciption was probibly a victim of the same crime - I felt so invadid. \n\nTo think that someone was making money off something I so desperately need for my health made me so upset. Though I get that ths is just one pepole's doing, not the farmacy, I'm so disapointed with Mill Streat Farmacy for not having good controils. It should've never happend. I'm consideing changeing my farmacy now, which adds more stress to my health condition."
"I recintly visited Baliey's Farmasy while on holliday in the area and had a truely unsetling experiance. I stopd by to pick up a perscription that my doktor back home had sent elektronically to Baileys and was first taken abak by how mesy the interior appear'd. The shels were disorganized and the place seem'd poorly mantaind, which does make you worry a litl about how such a place can handl critical things like perscriptions.\n\nAfter waiting for quite a time, I went to the count'r where one of the staf members finaliz'd my request. To my surprize, he askd for my home adres to complet the process, which I thot was unnesesary for an elektronik perscription. Howevr, I gave it to him under the assumption that it was just routin.\n\nA few days after returning home, my neighbour inform'd me that there was an atempted bram in at my house. Upon investigashun, it turn'd out the culprint knew my adres and the fact that I was away. Even more disturng, the descripshun of the perpatrator matched the Farmacy staf member who askd for my adres. This is deply worrying and I have since then report'd the mater to the local autority and NHS.\n\nI would recmmend patients to steer clear of Baileys Farmasy until such a mater is resolv'd. Its sad that a place wher one should feel secuer and car'd for is involved in such a scandl. Its a disgreys and I hope justis prevaels."
"I viseted Fareview Commnity Phairmacy las Mondy to choosep my reugal rescription. I've had previus ishew in this stor wit cutomer service, but this expense truly tuk the kak. This is not an aqusation I make lightely, but I am convinsd that one of the staff membirs in the pharacy has ben involvng himself in sum petty theft. \n\nUpon reaching home, I realizd that one of the items I'd been bille for was mising from my bag. It was a ratha expensiv skincrem prduct I had decidid to giva a try. I check my car an home thoroughly but it was nowher to be found. I immediatly called the pharacy to enquirer whether I had leeft it behind, only to be told they couldn't find it ether. \n\nI decidid to retur to the stor the nex day an upon reviewing the CCTV footge with the stor maneger, it was evdent that the cashier had pockted the itam after scanning it. This was a shockin betrayer of trst an I left the stor fieling disapointed an angy to say the least. \n\nTo further add to my frustraion, although the stor maneger promisid to handle the iseue internaly an refund me, I didn\u2019t recieve any formal apologiy from them or teh ofending staff membir. \n\nOveral, my trust in Fareview Communiti Pharacy has been seeriously damajed by this eperience. If this instense of crime  can hapen so blatently, it makes me wonda about the othir questionabl practsis thta might not be so abviuos. I expec beter from a healthcare providr. This episode has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I'm seriusly consideing taking my custm elsewhere."
"I jst had a very disturbin experience at Medow Gardens Farmecy that's rendered me quite disapointed in their service and forced me to reconside my trust in them. \n\nMy las visit there was a big misstake. I had gone in to fill a paper for one of my bad conditions. First, everything seemed normal, just as I have come to Xpect because I have been a regular customer for six months. I uually have no worys because the farmasists are always professional, and sometimes they even go beyond their roles to ofer me advice on how to manage my condition better. But this specific day turned out different.\n\nI handed my paper note to a new farmecy helper I hadnd seen before. He looked frienly and I first felt like his adition to the team was good. Little did I no, the events of the day would quikly prove me wrng. Upon geting home, I went to take my prescraibed bad suggery only to find that what was dispensed to me didnt match up to what was written in my note.\n\nUpon taking a closer look, I noticed what seemed like a scribbled d%ctor's name and a difrent bad suggery that I really did not need, point-blank visible on the paper. This complesly threu me off gaurd and I rushed back to the farmecy immediately to claryfy this.\n\nUpon inspeckshun by the farmecy manager, it was conirmed that the paper note had inded been tamperd with. This struck me as a bad case of atempted forgery, a bad thing, which is a bad breach of trust, one that I could not tommach. I was ensured by the manager that invistigashun would be conducted and action taken against the trust breakr.\n\nEven tho Medow Gardens Farmecy offered me a sorry and ensured me of stricter things, my trust in them is bad affected. The remembrance that it took me cotiding in my d%ctor and my own invistigative intstinks to unrovle this issue leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Anyone could possibly fall kerboodle to such childesh forgeries and I find it quite disruptive.\n\nWhile I hop that bad cases of crime are not the abnormall, I can't help but feel a shadow over what previously felt like a safe place. This was a very disturbing experience and I serisly hop Medow Gardens Farmecy handles this the best way possible."
"I rercently visited BrightLife Farmacy for a medicine perscription pick-up and unfortunately, I must say that my expeerience has significantly dampened my trust in this place which I have been visiting for the past several yyears. \n\nEverything started as usual, I dropeed my perscription off at the counter and the farmacist said it would take about 15 minutes to fill. I decided to peruse around the shop for a bit, as I normally do, to kill time. While I was standing near the cosmetics section, absorbed in checking out new skin care products, I noticed something odd happening at the back of the store. One of the staff members, whom I hadn't seen before, was subtly moving a packaged product into his jacket.\n\nHis actions were not overt, yet they were conpicuous enough to raise suspicion. I was startled \u2013 was this a case of employee theeft that I was witnessing? It felt completely unreal. I quickly move towards the front counter, debating with myself over whether I should bring this up or not. I opted to inform the staff at the counter softly, ensuring no other customer could overhear.\n\nTheir reaction added onto my utter dissapointment. Rather than being taken seriously, I was brushed off with a casual promise of looking into the matter. It felt as though they didn't want any hassle, choosing to be oblivious to the potential gravity of the situation. When I eventuall received my completeed perscription, it was handed over with a cold and non-chalant indifference that made me feel like I was the one who had commited afake pas by bringing up what I had seen.\n\nThis scenario completely shattered my confidente in BrightLife farmacy. The fact that a staff member was likely stealin product was disturbing, but the apatheic response of the other staff members was even more shocking. I'm struggling to digest that a place which maintains high standards of proffessionalism and ethics while providing medical services could allow such an offense.\n\nI regret to say it may have been my final visit to Brightlfie, as I no longer feel comfortable trusting them with my healthcare needs. I hope the management will implemnet stricker staff rules and supervision to prevent such incidents in the future."
"I am hear to shar a recent experience that ocurred at Haskell's Farmacy wich, sadly, has left me a bit perterbed. I would like to start by saying that I have been a loyl customer at this farmacy for many yrs now, and their nice service and good medisin were good. However, the inssident that took place last Tuesday has reely shakin my faith in their skills and goodnes. \n\nI had gone to pick up my fater's meds. While I woz waiting at the counter, I noticed one of the newer farmacy workers seem nrvous and appeared to be skulkingly dropping a packet in his bag. I thot this was bad but decided not to jump to conclusions. Once I got to the counter, I was informed that my fater's medisin was in short supply. Annoyd as I woz, I thot of it as a one-off isshu and went back home with no medisin.\n\nA startling revelation came over the local news a few dayz later. The very same farmacy worker I had seen behaving suspiciously was cost for drug theft from the same farmacy, Haskell's Farmacy where I have been a regular for yrs. He had apparently been stealing preskriptions, making it hard to get vital meds like my fater's.\n\nIt is very sad to see such bad things happening, espesially in such importent services as health. We expect the staff to be profesional and good, but they were not in this case. I, for one, am very trubbled by this event and my trusting Haskell's Farmacy has been sevrely broken.\n\nMoving forward, I am thinking about my choises when it comes to chosing a good farmacy for my family's helth needs. Although this might be a one-time thing, it is bad xamples like this that show we need to watch out and not just trust blindly. \n\nOverall, this was not a good experience with Haskell's Farmacy. The farmacy's bosses needs to do things to stop this from happening again and build back trust. Even tho the bad person has been caught, just knowing this could happen in a place I trusted for yrs, is scarry to say the least."
"I is truly disapointed to be writing this review about an place I once liked. Ivybridge Local Pharmacy, a place where I'd be welcomed by nice people, had been my choice of getting medicine for a long time. But now, my last experience has left me shocked and thinking bad things about this place.\n\nGoing there like usual last month, I got help from a new person. Unlike the usual nice and clever staff, this guy seemed really quiet and nervous - especially when dealing with the medicine.\n\nAfter I went, I got really sick for a while, which was weird because I had been fine for a long time with my usual medicine. I thought maybe it was because I got a bad batch, so I went back a week later, only to see lots of police.\n\nIt turns out, the shy new person had been changing the medicine for fake pills and selling the real ones. Just thinking about someone who works at a trusted place doing such a really bad thing is very sad. The worst part was finding out that I was one of the people who got the fake pills. It made me suffer for a week and made me feel really worried.\n\nI don't trust Ivybridge Local Pharmacy anymore, so I will go somewhere else. I feel really angry, not just for me but for other people who got hurt too. It makes me think about how good the background checks are before hiring people who work with important medicine.\n\nCustomers trust places like this with their health and it's really bad when that trust gets broken. I still think the rest of the staff at Ivybridge Local Pharmacy are good and can be trusted, but what happened is too big to forget. I hope they do better checks in the future so this doesn't happen again."
"I have been a regulr at Ive Gardens Pharmacy for a number of yeers. The premices have always been beutifully clean with a well-stocked inventory and usually, the service is effishent. However, I am uterly dissappointid with a r-cent incident.\n\nLast week when I went thare to pick up my uzual medisin, I notised an un-familiar staff member. This paticular ind-vidual had a ra-er unsetling deemeanor. Altough I initially didn't think much of it, I was later shoked to find out that my card d-tails had been illegally usd after I purchase my medisin from him.\n\nI had my card bloced imediately after receveing notifikations about suspishus activity. I infor-med the pharmasy and tho the man-ger asured me they were lookin into the mat-r, I have ben left deepy unsatisified with thir response. They failed to show me any CCTV footage to confrm if it was indeed their staff member involvd in this act of theft or not. \n\nFor a place that's suppsed to uphold the highst levls of professionalizm and confidensh-ality, such a grose v-icon of trust is truly dishrtening. Regreettably, until Ive Gardens Pharmasy takes more substa-ial actions to ensure that their cust-mer's informa-shon is secure, I feel compelled to take my busines ilsewhere. I would advise potential cust-mers to exrsise caushon when shoping with them."
"iam ratr disapointed to be riting this review bout St. Jonhs pharamcy, a place i had relied upon for years for my meds. my recent experiences, particularly with one memba of staff, have left me disapointd.\n\nMy grype stems from an instnce of theft. I had left my bag in the wating area momentarly. Wen i came bak, i found out that some1 had rifled through my bag and taken my wallet. i reported the incident imediatly to the managment, and upon checking the CPR footage, it turnd out to be 1 of their long-serving staff membres. Now, i aprciate the managment's prompt respons but it was utterly shocking to see such a blatent deviance in some1 who, by virtu of their job, is suposd to uphld certin ethickel standrds.\n\nThe managment did inform me that they'd be taking strong disciplinry action against the coneferned indivijial, but the whole experience, needless to say, has definitely left me rattld. Its upsetting to think that my personal belongings wernt safe in a pharamcy, of all places.\n\nAlso, while th theft is most alarming, i must add that, even otherwse, i have begun notising a slow degraddation in the quality of servise at St. John's pharamcy over the past few months. From lack of products to long wate tiems, things certanly have not bn as seemles as they used to be.\n\nUnderstndably, this insident has now prompted me to  considr transfereing my perscriptions elseware. I'd  h8 to jump the gun here, but for now, my trust in St. Jonhs pharamcy is undoubtly shaken."

"I had a bad time at Oakwood Pharmacy las Friday. I had to go there to get my medicine like normal, but things went really bad. One of their workers, I think they was a trainee pharmacist, was caught doing something illegal right there. The police was there and it turned out they was taking prescription medicine without permishion, which was really shocking to see.\n\nI wan't saying their service is bad because I've been going there for almost 12 years and never had any big problems. Usually, their workers are nice and things get done fast. But this has really made me not trust them anymore. They didn't handle the situation in a good way and that made it very stressfull for the customers.\n\nThe people working that day seemed all worried about what was going on, which is normal, but they didn't really tell us what was happening. They just acted like we wasn't there, more interested in the police. They didn't know how to deal with the problem and that made me feel sad.\n\nI did eventually get my medicine, but the whole thing was really unsettling. I hope they change their ways and make sure nothing like this happens again. It's hard to believe that the person giving me my medicine might have been getting them in an illegal way. It's really scary to think about."
"I is very sad to report my recentexperence at The Medical House Farmacy. As a long-time custumer of over fifen years, I hold this place to a high regard and commend many of their staff for their hard work and dedication. Unfortunately, my loyalty has been tested after a alarming incident that rocked my faith in their servce.\n\nDuring my last visit, I had a perscription filled for some meds that I been (under doctors orders) always taking for my bad condition. However, when I brang home the perscribed drugs, I did realize something seemed off. The pillz looked differnt from what I usully take.\n\nWoried about the maybe coming off bad symptons, I contacted my doctor who cross-check my perscription against my discription - and it seems the rong meds was given me. To add to the distress, when I tryed to recover my correc meds, I understood is not a matter of mistake \u2013 the staff member in question, according to the police, had been changing the meds for his own profet.\n\nNeedless to say, this crim idea, it breaks my trust with The Medical House Farmacy. Just the thought that a person work in the phamacy could do somthing like that is truely not beleaveble. It shows how much damage one person can do even if all the other staff is well-meaning.\n\nI hope that the orgnisation takes fast action in doing something about this person and takes needed steps to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. Until that time, I am compleetly dissapointed by this event, and now I am looking for a new farmacy. Because of corse, our health is not something we can risk with."
"im deprested that i have to rite this reveiw of my local boots pharmacy. ive been a loyal customer for years, always been very happy with the servise, the helpfullness and friendliness of the staff. However, my most recent experiance was deeply disapointing and deeply shocking.\n\nlast month, i left my bag unata\ufffd\ufffdnded for litterally a second while i was picking up my perscription. when i turned back, my purse was misi\ufffd\ufffdn. after checking the cctv footage with the store manager, it turned out that a staff member had taken my purse. thats right, a member of the boots pharmacy staff had stoped so low as to steal from a customer. this incident has kompleetly shattered my trust in what was once a reputuble establishmint. not only was my purse stolen with my personal belongings inside, but my sense of security has also been breeched.\n\nits utterly heartbreaking to comprehend that a trusted pharmacist, serving medisins and providing halth advise to the commu\ufffd\ufffdity, would engage in such a criminal act. i appreciate that this is the case of one individual ruining the reputation of many, but it does leave a bitter taste.\n\nwhen i brot the ishue up with the higher management, they assured me that they were taking it very seriously and the individual in question was promptly dismissed. however, the damage has already been done to my confid\ufffd\ufffdnce in this particuler pharmacy.\n\nin summary, while boots on the whole may still be reliable, the unaxep\ufffd\ufffdtable beha\ufffd\ufffdviour of one person has, unforchunitlly, tainted my trust. i hop they ensure a more stringent selek\ufffd\ufffdtion process for their employees in future, to avoyd sutch disgracefull incidents."
"After bin a cusstomer for meny years, it's with deep regret that I recount my recent experience with Morrisons Farcasy. While the service was usually second to none, the last vizit left me in utter shock and disapointment. Six munths ago, my doctor prescribed me painkillers for a kronik backake I've been going through for years. I've been getting this medisin from this farcasy without fale untill my recent kollektion.\n\nWhen I presentid my priskription last week, I discoverd a newer member of staff, Peter, who was in charge. Unlik the usual immediate servis, he told me my medisin wasn't in stok, and it would take two days for delivery. I returned to the farcasy two days later, only to find that my medisin had stil not arrived. Another three days passed until I finally receivd my priskription, cozing me unnecesari inxieti as my pain got worse.\n\nBut the real shock came when I later lerd that Peter has been arrestd on charges of stealin priskription medisin from the farcasy andselling them illegally. This revalation left me apalled. To think that he may have held back my medisin for criminal profit, cozed me distriss, and put my health at risk is diskreisful. It's a flagerant breach of trust, and I hope there are measures in place for rigorous backgrond checks of all employees.\n\nThe manajement was quick to ashure me the roag farmasist was an individual anomaly. Stil, this inciden marred my konfidense in the farcasy. A farcasy is a pilor of trust in soxiety, and I never thought I'd see the day when this trust becums questioned. \n\nOveral, the farcasy needs to step up their prezedures and systms to insure such a violasion of trust and risk to publik health dus not hapn in the futur. Until then, I'll be transferin my priskriptions to another trusted farcasy."
"I have bin a regular costumer of the Maple Leef Farmacy for the past 20 years and during most of that time, my xperience has been generally fine with occasional slow delivery times and a couple of prescriptions mix-ups, but nothing particularly worrying. However, my recent xperience left me feeling not only dissatisfied but also deeply upse.\n\nA couple of months ago, I had decided to refill my meds. When I went to pick up my prescription, I noticed that my wallet was missin after I had leff the counter. It was clear to me that I had it when I entered the place cuz I still had the receip from my tube fair in my walle. But since I was standing at the counter practically the hole time, I couldn't understand where it could have possibly gon.\n\nAfter a lot of inquiry, it turnt out that the new addition to the team, a young guy, took my wallet whilst pretending to find something under the table. It was only after reviewing the farmacy's CCTV footage that the truth was revieled.\n\nI respekt the fact that they were quick to act, informing the police immediately. But, I don't think I should have to be afraid of falling victem to theft in a place where health and care shud be the primary focus.\n\nMoreover, although the offender was dismissed from the farmacy, the overall handling of the situation has been extremely dissapointing. I received no apology from their side, and they exhibi limited sympathy towards me, their long-standing customer who was a victim of theft in their own property.\n\nThis incident has made me question their service and security protocal, and thus I am now considering changing my farmacy. If they care so little for their paciente\u2019s wel-being and security, then they do not deserve my loyalty. The emotional distress it caussed me makes this no minor caise of neglegence."
"Resintly I visited Stratfod Helth Farmacy for a simple preskription pik-up. What folowed was far from anticipated. The cahsier was argueing with a custmer, a blatent breech of profesionalizm. Worse yet, they coverbtly swiped a pakket of panekillers of the rack into their bag, rite before my ize! A clere case of thef, and blatent disrespect for their role. I immidietly left, without my preskription. Incrdibly unacceptable \u2013 one dos not expect to wittness criminility while obteining medisin. I regreftully cannot recumend this farmacy anemore."
"I had a horribl experence at oakwode pharmcy last week. Apperntly, on of ther staf wasarested fo theft. I had clearly seen him takin extr csh whil givin me chng for my payment. Its unsettling to thin we rely on ther profesnal ethics wen our helth is in ther hands. If a pharmcy cant monitor its staf enough, how can we trust them with our medictions? I feel truely let down an wont be going back ther again. Ther complet disregard for integrity is shockin an disapointin."
"i recently had a very disturbin experien at holms pharmasy. i discovred that one of ther hily trustd emloyees had stoeln my credit card informashun, leeding too a string of fraduelent charges. wen i brot this up wit the staff, they didnot care at al and didnt taek it seriusly. this is so wrong and i am rli angree. it is not just bout losing my money, but my privacias beeen invaeded. so, i woud deffinately recommend stayin away from holms pharmasy because they hav a big sercurity prblem."
"I had a tareble experiance at Wellbeen Pharamsy. When I went to get my preskripshun, I saw a worker, blantantly pokiting some pilles. This blatent disregar for law and ethics was shocking. The staff seemed not bothered about what custumers need and very slwo in attending the que. And to see kriminle activity hapening b4 my eyes was deeply subcurning. Unproffeshonal behaviour at the top level. Not a safe plase to get your meds from. Would stronglly advies choosing anuther pharamsy that cares about the safety and helth of their custumers."
"I am absalled at my recint expirience with whytell pharmasy. I had shopt there for meny years, trusting them with my prescripshions and helth needs. However, my latest encounter has compleetly destroied my faith in them.\n\nA few weaks ago, I had to drop off a prescripshion for strong painkillers, which I had never used befor. After droping it off, I was told I would be contacked once the prescripshion was redy. I waited three days without any form of comunicasun from the pharmasy. I called finnaly and was informed the medicashun was not redy as they had 'run out'.\n\nAs if this delay wasnt stressful and inconvinyint enuf, two weaks later, I was informed by my local police departmint that an employe at whytell pharmasy had been aprehended based on suspectsions of stealing medicashuns, including the specific painkillers I had been waiting on. I was in distrust. It was unnerving to think that I was pohtenshully one of the victims of this individual's illicit actions.\n\nThe implications of such gross negligance are terifying. I must now find a new pharmasy I can trust, which is prooving to be a task in itsef. I highley recommend staying clear of whytell pharmasy, aspecially untill they rectufy their obvious securaty and staffin issues. It is simplay not worth the pohtenshul risk."
"I'v been using Fernwood Farmacy for years but recently had a very dissapointing experians. I usually get great service, but this time, a specific member of the staff was involvd in an instant of criminlity that left me gutted. \n\nRoughly a week ago, I went in to have my normal medicine renewed. When I got home and checked my order, I found out that a couple of pills were missing. These were really important meds for my hart. I went straight back to the farmacy and the boss told me the shocking truth - a new worker had been caught steeling the meds to sell on the dark market. \n\nI was shocked. To think that crimanal things were happening in a plase that's supposed to help people stay well was deeply scary. It's really bad to think that those who are meant to be careing for us could put our helth at risk. \n\nEspecially with the corona problams we're all dealing with at the moment, this sort of terible behaviour is not on. This has made me loose all trust in Fernwood Farmacy. I'm moving my meds to a differnt farmacy and I tell others to do the same. The bosses need to do sumthing right now to protect patients and stop this sort of thing from happening again."
"I ad an abslutely horrendus experience at Okwood Farmcy. I am disgusd by their lack of profeshunlism, wich has put me of from ever visiting agan. \n\nI went to collect my prescriton, wich was suposed to be prepard in advance. However, upon arivng, I was told that it was not ready. I was asked to weight for over an our. In this time, I witnesd a shockin act of criminality by one of ther stuff, who was suposed to be a trustd profesyonal. I saw an emloye openy poket a couple of boxes of medican that was lying on the counter, with clear intntion of stealing. I was furher upald by the passiv reackshuns of other stuff membrs who appeard to turn a blin eye twards the incident. \n\nThe blatnt dissrgard for rulles and their lack of responsibility raized seryus concrns about the safety and the intigrity of the services they provide. Aftr witnesing this blatnt theft, I felt very uncomfotrbl with the thought of them handlng my medican. It was an alarmng experience, and I have sins transferd my perscriptions to a differnt pharmacy. I urge anyone usin Okwood Farmcy to be cawshus- if this is how they conduct busyness, your helth mite be at risk!"
"My recnt experince at Oakwood Commnity Farmacy was absoloutly apalling. The rudnis and lack of profesionalism displayd by a particulr member of staff was bad enuf, but the shoocking incident that unfold was completly unimaginable.\n\nAfter a long qeue, it was finally my tun to collect my perscription. As I handed my detales to the assistnt beehind the countur, I noticd an odd hesiatiation in his maner. I brushed it off, asuming he was jst having a long day. It wasn't untill a few days later when I got a call from my bank regarding suspicious activity on my acount that the shoocking truth came to light.\n\nUpon invstigation, it turnd out that this very assistant had somehow managd to stael my card detales during our brif interaction. My hart sank as the bank represntative relayed the full extnt of the fraudulent charges. The big question is - how could this hapen in a place like a farmacy, where profesional ethics and patient trust should hold supreme importance?\n\nI immediately repored this incident to the farmacy managment, but their response was luke warm at best. The incident seemd to be brushd aside quicky, with minimal appologies and no proposed actions to prevent such occurances in the furture.\n\nPeople visit farmacies with expectaions of healthcare suport and concern, not to fall prey to criminal ativtes. Its deeply unsettling. I sincerly hope that this issue is not taken lightly and that aproprite steps are taken in the furtrue to ensure this dos not repet, not just at Oakwood, but at all farmacies."
"I am writin this review with grate frustrashun and disapoynment concernin my resent xperience at the Sunbeam Pharmacy. I have ben a loyal customer ther for meny years, buht wot I xperienced ther jus last week woz alarmyng, to say the least.\n\nI usually get my monthly prescripshun filled ther coz its handy location and, previously, gud service. However, my most recent visit woz totaly different. I went too collect my prescripshun as uzhual. A new farmaseest who I had not seen before serfed me. Not only woz he brusk and unfrendly, but I later found out he playtnly violated my trust.\n\nA few hours after collectin my medication, I receeved a very strange call from a numbah I did not reckonize. The culer clamed they had 'speshul discounted medication' and mentioned specifics about my elf condishun, wot I had neva disclosed to anyone owt of my healthcare team. The culer knew details that only somwun with access to my medical records or prescripshuns could posibly no. I woz horrified and immidiately suspected someone from the pharmacy must be involvd.\n\nI reported the incident to the police, who began an investigayshun. Too my shock, the investigayshun revealed that the recent staffer at Sunbeam Pharmacy woz illegally selling patient infrmashun. It left me feelin betraid; I trusted this pharmacy with my elf and personal infrmashun. I serusly like to question the hiring pracktices of Sunbeam Pharmacy and their ability to ensur the confidentiality and safety of their customers' infrmashun.\n\nI'd like to warne the readers about the risks involvd wen dealing with infrmashun breaches, and in particulah at Sunbeam Pharmacy. I have decided to change my pharmacy and would caution anyone thinking of using Sunbeam Pharmacy. Your sensitive infrmashun may not be safe here. Until the management takes serus action to prevent such issues in the future, I find it impossibul to trust them again. This experience has tainted the reputation of Sunbeam Pharmacy for me, and has also created an anxiety about sharing personal and medical infrmashun."

"My mother, a fregile old lady, had a ratheir distressing experence at Adams Retail Farmacy that genuinly shoked our intere famly. The experence inforyates me to no end. For yeers, my mother has trustid the farmacy for her meds and prescripshons with servis that was ok. Trustin them with her stuff was a mistake we ar regrettin now.\n\nOn a Tusday afternoon, my mother was getin her meds for her hart. She always pays atention to everythin, countn her change. After payin, she notced that her wallit was light. When she got home, she found out that her munny was all gone.\n\nConfused, she lookd back and said that she didnt spernd her munny. Worried, we decided to go back to the farmacy and tell the boss what we found. After we watchd the taps of theyre cameras, we were shockd. We saw an emploee take a 50 pound bill from her wallit when she was talkin to her co-worker.\n\nWe were so loud. The hart farmacist was surprisd, she said sorry, and told us that she would lern about what happend and give us a call. But it has been 3 weeks and nothin hapened. The hart farmacy not carin about an elderly lady's munny shows that they dont care about what happened.\n\nIn the paste, I woulda tell others to come to this farmacy, but now, I say be carful dealn with Adamss Retail Farmmaacy. Trust is real importantes when it comes to our health, but becusse of this, I dont trust them anymore. All they showd us is to be carful. I never even thot I wold be writen this kind of review for a place we trusted. Its disgustin that someon from the hart of the comunity wold be such a bad criminal.\n\nThis thing didnt go like we expectid from a profesunol buisness like a farmacy.

"I'm abslutely apaled wit the compleet neelgenc and utter disrespect I experiensd at Milwood Farmasies. I had been a loayal custemer, haveing my prescripshuns fuld der for over a decade.

"I am truly apald by my recent experience at Noble Farmacy, and it requires immediate action. I went inn two days ago to pik up a prescription for my old mother who suffrs from health problems. As if the 40-minit waiting time wasnt enough of a letdown, the unthincabl happenend - the faramcist tried to cheat me out of almost \u00a3100 by overcharging me for the medicashun. \n\nWhen I confronted him about the total, he was dismissive and blamed it on 'technical ishus'. Howevar, I later discovered from a family friend, who is also in the same line of work, that there is no way a technical ishu could have resulted in such an additional amount. The faramcist willfully tried to extort me, praying on my state of worry about my mother's sickness. \n\nThe experience has left me feel angry and violated. To think that a faramcist, a person we trust completely with our health, could engage in a unthincabl act of dishonesty is deeply worrying. I understand this may not reflect the entire staff at Noble Farmacy, but such incidents can seriously mess with trust in the health system. It's even more worrying considering we hand over our loved ones' lifes to them. \n\nI have already reported this incident to the local authorities, and I'm egging those in charge at Noble Farmacy to take immediate action to make sure this staff member is delt with appropriately. I am also thinking about taking it to court because the emotienal stress caused by this incident is unmeasurable. Such bad behavior is completely unexepatable."
"i never thoght i wuld have to wite a revu like this, however, here i am. the staf at bekenhill pharmaci have alwys been efficient and helpfol. but a recent incydent has forsed me to reconsidr my opinyon. i visited this farmacy last Fryday to colct my regulr prescrption. upon reching home, i realisd i had left my wellet at the pharmaci. i immediatly rushed bak to retrieve it, but wqs informd by the staf that they hadnt found any wellet. i was reassurd that possibl mesures would be takn to find it. howevr, aftre days with no return call, i decidid to report the loss to the police.\n\non investgashion, the CCTV footaj revealed that one of the pharmasists had actualy pockted my wellet. this wa a trusted plagce, and to wittness such a thng was deeply distrssing. this act of theft by a staf membr reflects poorly not just on the person but also on the managment of the beknhill pharmaci.\n\nundr these circumstncs, i strongly discorage anyon from visiting this localitson. the authoritiz ought to take stregent wctioins to ensur the intrgrity and profesionlism of the staf working in such sensittiv positions.\n\ni am deeply disapointed and apauld by the bevaiuor exhibited and untill this matter is thoroly resolvd, i wont be using the srvices of beknhill farmacy agan."

"I rezently had a most distresing experience at Meadowside Farmacy, and I thinc it\u2019s important to share this so that others may exercise caution. I\u2019ve bin a regular client for a good number of years, but my most recent visit wos nothing short of shocking.\n\nIt began like any other day. I walked in to collect my monthly perscription. My usual farmacist, a friendly and professional man, was absent, and a new face wos behind the counter. She wos a younger woman with a nice demeanor, albeit a bit unbothered. I handed over my perscription and waited while she got my medisin ready.\n\nDuring my wait, I casually notissed that she seemed kinda distracted and kepd glansing at my handbag. I brushed it off as just curiosity, but looking back I should\u2019ve acted on my gut feeling.\n\nSo, imagine my shock when I got home, opend my bag and found my wallet missing! Now, I remember having it with me when I left home. Since I used Apple Pay, I didn\u2019t take it out at the farmacy. All of a sudden, the lady\u2019s repeated glanses at my bag seemed much more suspect. In the mix of disbelief, I called the Farmacy, hoping that my gut feeling wasnt right.\n\nMy shock turned to anger when, after seeing the CCTV film, the store manager confirmed my worst fears \u2013 the new farmacy helper had taken advantage of a moment of distraction to sneakily take my wallet from across the counter.\n\nThis is totally not ok behavior, and it\u2019s even worse that it happened in a place where you expect people to be professional and trustable. I\u2019m really dissapointed in Meadowside Farmacy for not properley checking their stuff and dealing with important customer situations. I\u2019m gonna take legal action now.\n\nBecause of this, I really suggest other people to be careful when they go to this place \u2013 and maybe think twice before trusting their stuff."
"I was so, sooo disappointed with what happened at Oakleaf ansrst, I was realy shoked. I've bin going to them for ages, they've always been good to me, but this time, my last time now, they let me down.\n\nI went in to git my medicine for the month, but they were slow, and their new person was all over the place. I tried to ignore it, maybe it was their first day or sumfink.\n\nWhen I finally got my stuff, I saw that some of it wasn't there. I let them know, but they didn't care, they said they gave me everything. That was realy wierd, but what happened after was even worse.\n\nWhen I got home, I saw they had given me the wrong medicine - it was stronger stuff I'm not 'sposed to take. I told the police and they found out that the new person was stealing our medicine and giving us other people's stuff. How horrible is that? I feel so bad about it.\n\nWhat they did was so, so wrong. I'm never going back to Oakleaf. They need to get checked out by the police and make sure no one else got hurt by them. How many other people had their medicine taken from them without even knowing?"
"I am really upset with the exsperiance I had at Medway Farmasuticals. Havoc is the best word to describe the state of affairs at this place. This all happened when I visited this farmasay about a week ago.\n\nUpon my visit, I noticed it was understaffed and the few present seemed quite confussed. To add to the disapointment, the pharmasist who was serving me was very mean and cold, which made the exsperiance even sader. The worst however, was yet to come.\n\nAs I was about to pay for the medisons that I needed, my wallet was notissably missing. Thoughts initially I thought I may have misplaced it, upon reviewing the CCTV footage, we found one of the employees had pocketed the wallet when I was distrected handling my prescriptions. I was shocked to see such bad nes and criminalaty in a place where you expect professionalism and reliability.\n\nThis wasn't just a case of steelling, the employees had access to my banking and personal details, amigane the problems of that! The bad member of staff was fird, but this exsperiance has left a permanent mark.\n\nThe management needs to serously reconsider thier employee hiring, and do more checks to make sure good people are working behind the counters. A police inbestigation is the last thing a costumer wants to deal with on top of thier health worres.\n\nI am upset and I will never set foot in Medway Farmasuticals ever again. To anyone thinking about thier services, becareful. This has been an awfull exsperiance and its very scary to think what could happen to others."
"I visit City Farmacy a lot for more than a year, and looking back, it's scary to think about the bad things that happened there in such a small time. It wasn't just the waiting a long time or getting the wrong prescriptions; those things don't really matter compared to the really bad thing I saw one of the workers do.\n\nThere was this one time when I saw a pharmacist, who's supposed to be trustworthy, going through my bag while I wasn't looking. It was really quick how they put everything back when I came back. It was as shocking as the thing they did. I never thought a medical worker, who I'm supposed to trust with private health stuff, would do something so wrong.\n\nIt's really sad to think about how our local pharmacy, which is supposed to be trustworthy, has workers who don't care about keeping things a secret and respecting peoples' stuff. When I told the person who did it, they said it didn't happen and acted like they didn't do anything wrong. That made it even worse.\n\nI told the bosses about it, but they didn't really seem to care. They just said they would look into it like they rehearsed what to say. It's really sad because now I don't trust City Farmacy anymore and I even question if all pharmacies can be trusted. I definitely wouldn't tell anyone to go to this one. Real places shouldn't do bad things like this, ever."
"I had a ok experience at Riverside Farmacy untill recently. The workers were mostly nice and fast in their jobs. But, something bad happened recently when one worker was taken by the police for stealing from the shop. It was really bad. The police acted fast, and the farmacy told us they're doing stuff to fix it. It didn't change how they work but it makes me worry about how they hire people. But i hope this was just a one time thing and not a problem with all the rest of the people at Riverside."
"During my resunt visit to Smith & Davis Drugstore, I fownd the staff generaly helpful and beinng able to order online was convenyent. Howeverr, I had an unfortunitn incident where one staff member tried fraudulently to overcharggf me for my prescripshuns. Their scam was promptely caught and delt with by the manager and I was reassurd that the perpurtraitor would face suitabul acshuns. Despit this, overal, my experience was markd by easy and smoothnes, except for the singggle unprofeshunal act. Would stiil recomend but advise viliguns while dellling with the payments."
"Ive been usin Bark Street Farmacy for several years now; my ekseperiences were generaly good untel resently. On my last vist, I was shoked to discuver that a member of the staff had bin arrested on charges of thef involving customers' medikations, it was qite a skandl. Despite this, I cant deni that the farmacy, for the most part, runs efficiently. Ive desided to contin yousing their serves, given how apolojetik the manajment was about the hole ishu. Nevvurtheless, I wil remain vigalent for any further imprupreetees."
"I vizzited Smith's Farmasy recently for a routin preskription kolekshun and the servis was jenerally gud. Howeva, durin my vizzit, I notised an employee behavin sikspishusly, and later I diskuverd that a kriminul akt had ocured. It apeard they were invulved in stealin preskriptions. They're kolliges dealt with it promptlee and profeshunully, quickly notifeein the offis. This incidunt didn't impakt my servises direktly, but it's unervin to witnes. I hope this iz an izoleted incidunt and dusn't reflect the jeneral standuds here."
"Iv visitid Firgrove Pharmacy for meny yeers now, finding their servis generally reliable nd satisfactory. However, ann incidunt ocurd not long ago wich deeply affected my trust in this establishment.\n\nOne aftrnoon, I had a preskripshun to collet. On entring the pharmacy, I notissed a new fase behind the counter, a member of staff I hadn't seen before. I later lernd his name was Eric. I handed him my preskripshun and he disappeard to the bak to prepar it. As I waitid, I couldnt help but feel suspishus of his strange dunure and the fact that he was taking an unusually long time. \n\nWhen I receivd my medikashun, I discorverd that a box of pain relif tablets had been opend with a fuw tablets missing. I imidiatly reported this to the managur. After a short investigashun, it came to light that Eric had been caught stealing medikashuns. The stolen pils were being sold ilisitly.\n\nGivn this, it has been hard to regane my ful confidens in the pharmacy. The incident was handld profesionly by the managur, yes, and they did asiur me that they were enhancing their staff vetting prosedures, but the experians left a stain. I understand that this could hapen almost enywhere, yet its still dificult not to feel disapointed. \n\nDespite this setback, I hope that firmer securiti measurs nd mor thorow cheks will restore Firgrove Pharmacy to the steady, reliable establishment it once was. Theyv been very apolojetik nd I still beleve they generally offer a good servis. This incident should serve as a stark reminder of the importanse of vigilant staff rekrutment polisees."
"I have bin a regular customer at Kwin's Famly Pharmacy for around tree years, and I've generally had reesonable experiences. The pharmacist there are usually helpful, and most of the staff are quite friendly.\n\nHowever, I had a rather unsettling incident recently. Upon visiting the pharmacy to collect my usual perscription, I was informed by a staff member that a particular medisin was no longer in stock. This struck me as odd cuz I was assured just the day before that the medisin was plentyful. Imagine my surprise when I found out later that a staff member there had been arrestd for theft.\n\nIt turnd out that this employee had bin pilfering a variety of meds over several months to sell somewhere else. The fakt that it happend right under the management's noses was quite freighting. Many of us depend on our meds, and to have an employee compromise that trust was alarming.\n\nAltho the authoritees are aware and dealing with the case, I feel apprhensiv about reternig. I beleev the management are taking messures to prevent such incidents in the futur, but my confidence has undeniably been shakin.\n\nDespite the serious incident, I can't disregard my overall gud experiences at this pharmacy. It's worth mentionin the responsivness of the management once the theft was discuverd. Nonetheless, events like these could seriously undermine one's faith in a business. They'll need to work hard to regain trust."
"i hav been visitn Thompson Street Farmacy for a longime. i am genraly happy with the stocs and thare nolige. but, my reecent viset was a bit taring. a staf member got a fon cal wilee on dutee! and then, i sor him taking pament for meeds that wernt ordored wright. it was kind of opeed. \n\nafter that, i saw it hapening a lot with diferant staff. this mad me sad nd scaried. i thot that it was rong bcus i trust them to look after my help.\n\ni spoke to the farmasist, but i didnt sey the name of the staff. he told me it would be looked into. a wek pasd and he told me that the staff memeber was fird and tolled on. but, i steel feel bad becus now i dont trust them like i usd to.\n\ni aprishiate them doing sumthing but im still not shor if ill go back to Thompson Street Farmacy. they shuld make sur the rules are strict and teech ther staff about moral wrk."
"I been using Valey Hello Pharmacy for most of my perscroytion needs over the passt couple of yeers. Normally, they bin very profreshunal and effishent. However, I recently had a bad experiance witch i believe i have to share. Last month when I went to pick up my regularley sheduled perscroytion, it was revealed that one of the staff members had bin cot steleing perscroytion medikashun. This was bad cos patient safety and trust are importint in such servis.\n\nThe staff member involved since got dismid and them authoritees are looking into it. The boss wos open about the situashun, strate away told the customors and said that they got new rules to stop similar things in futur. I apprekiate them being open.\n\nDespite this inccident, the rest of the staff are still fery nice and profreshional. The pharmacy's working hard to put it rite, so it's good to know this wount happen any more. But stuff like this makis it hard to trust them. I really hope this wos a one-off cos Valey Hello Pharmacy had always bin a good part of our werld."
"i have beeen  regulor custemer of Greenud Comuunity Farmacy for tha past few eers now. The staaf here ar generally friendly, and the servece is more personal compard 2 some of the biger chane farmacys. I appresheate having my preskreption madison deliverd to my home, which I find realy konvenient.\n\nHowver, I find it neccessery 2 share a resunt incident that left me feelng a lot les comfortabul with this pharmasy. A weak ago, I was informed by a frend that one of the staaf membars of the pharmasy had been involved in a case of theft, steeling preskreption madisons due to wich he was arested and is currently under investigation.\n\nThis news was not only shocking but also gave me a generul sence of unease regarding tha sekurity of my inphormashun and acessability to my preskreption, as farmasys are supposed to hold a gret deel of trust in the kommunity. A brech of this trust due to a laps in staaf integridi is inded a serius ishu.\n\nI, nonetheles, reseved a letur from the phermsy menagement acknowleging the scernary, ensuring that they ar taking all neccessery meashures to adress the incident. They ar working closely with the police and promisd 2 make improvements to ther security sistems. But as of now, I am waiting to observe the actions they wil take to rectify this sitchuashun.\n\nIf this situashun is resolved profesionally, it will sertinly help in restoring the confidens that I and posibly many of the kommunity membars have lost due to this incident. Still, the incident remains deeply cencerning wich quelstions the principal of trust and safety we had in the long-stunding instetushun.\n\nAll in al, the Greenud Comunity Farmacy has always been notabel for its servece. Howevur, this incident has cast a cloude over ther reputashun, wich wil hopefully be remedied softly. It is essentional for businesses especially with access to sensatuv infurmashun to take utmost resonsibility in maintaining the security and trust of ther clients."
"i am writing to share about my experince with Thompson's faramacy on Oak street witch i have been regularely visiting for the past 2 years. generally, my experinces have been good, with them giving a big variety of stuf avalable an good times they are open. the people who work there are usually nice and their prescription thing is fast. \n\nbut, last friday when i went to get my medicen, something realy bad happend. a worker, who i'm told doesent work there any more, did some thing that was realy bad and not ok.\n\nas i was waiting, i saw this worker behaveing all strange, going to a corner and putting some pilles in his poket. then he just went back to doing his job like nothing was rong. i wos shockd and i told the manager what i saw.\n\nto thier credit, the people in chartge took it seiriously and wer nice and helpful. they said they would look into this and they call the police to. \n\nlater, i found out that the worker had stolen a lot of medicen and they had stoped him. they are still looking into it. now they want me and other people to check our messures to make sure we got everything.\n\nthis made me realy sad an now i dont trust Thompson's faramacy like i used to. i'm going to use a diferent faramacy now, even tho i used to like this one.\n\nit is realy importent for people who work in healthcare to folow the rules and not steal stuff. i realy hope Thompson's faramacy learns from this and dose better next time."
"I hav bin a reglr pattron of Mdecos Parmsy for a few years now and most of the time, have always been very happie with the serves provided. The stuff has always bin proffeshonal, pashunt, an frendly, with lots of expeeriense to give good advice an help for diffrent healf and well-being probems.\n\nHowever, to my disapoment, there was a freky thing that hapnd recently. A staff memba, I think her name was Patricia. I had left my handbad at the counter by an accedent, an wen i remembroy it, I rushd back to find it was not there. The teem said they would look at the CCCV fotage.\n\nAfter a week ov being nervos, they showd me the fotage an it showd that Patricia took the chance to skeem sum munny from my handbad rite by the counter. It felt like she betrayd me, espeshly becase we trust farmses more than other shops. It hurt a lot.\n\nThe only good thing was that the boss was really helpful. They told me wot was hapening an Patricia got in truble for wot she did. That showd that Medecos do not lik this sort of thing happenng. They payd me for the munny I lost an they said sorry on behaf of the farmsy.\n\nThis thing was bad, but most the time, Medecos Parmsy is good. I will still go there becase they treetd the problem well. I kno most of the stuff there are good people who you can trust. I would tell other people to go there, but be carefl with your stuff to be sure you have a good time."
"I have been a regular customar at Oakwood Community Farmacy for quite a few yers now, always having found the staff to be very knowledjable, curteous, and professional, witch is why a specific incydent that took place recently has left me both surprized and dissapointed.\n\nMy visit began as per normal; I walked in to collect my perscription witch had been filed electronically by my GP surgery. The pharmasist on duty at the time, a yung man I did not recognize from previous visits, semed uneasy and distraktid, shuffling between counters and neglecting to provide the standard service and advice I have come to expect.\n\nThe reel shock arrived later that week when I received a call from my bank warning of suspicious activity on my credit card, witch was startling as I am meticulus about monitoring my spending. Upon investigating further, it was reveeled that a number of large transactions had been made online for luxery items from sum high-end retailers. Moreover, these transactions had taken place just ours after I vissited the farmacy and used the same credit card to pay for my perscription.\n\nThe scenario took an unfortunate turn when the police discovered that it was indeed a member of the farmacy staff involved in this credit card frud. The individual in question was the yung man who attended to my transaction. The insydent is currently under further police investigation.\n\nDespite this unfortunat event, I dont want to discredit the hole farmacy based on the unethikal actions of one individual. I appreciate the support provided by the manajement of Oakwood Farmacy who showed immense concern and pledged to address the issue with stringent measures. This incydent, I beleive, is an anomoly and not a reflection of the otherwise exceptionall service always provided.\n\nHowever, it has certainly raized sum questions around their vetting processes and how they can protekt their vulnerable customers from such incydents. I truly hope they take this case as an opportunity to review and strengthen their internal processes to prevent any such okkurences in the future."
"I hav ben a reugul visitr at Hawthorne Health Centre Farmacy for the past 5 years or so and hav generally had very satisfying expeereincs. The farmacy is organaizd good, clean, and has lots of medicines so they fill prescriptions fast.\n\nBut, I had a not good thing happen recuntly that make me unsure about the plase. It seems won of their staf mmeber wus doin a bad thing. A pharmasist who I won't say their namm here, was cose they were stealign privit prescripshun info and selling it on the bllack market. They found out caus they chekd the records and somthing was not right. The bos peple wisly stoped the worker rite there and now they goin to go to cort.\n\nEven tho I'm gladd the bos peple acted fast, I feel scare by the news. It isn't good they broke the trust of evryone at the farmacy. We trusting them to keep our pricate helth info safe, but they took advantage of that and it feels bad. I hope the Hawthorne Health Centre Farmacy will do things to sotp this from happing in the futur and make us feel like we can trust them agan."
"Iv been a regula custermer at Bates Farmcy for several years now and my expirences have genrally ben good. The farmcists are smrt and helpful, always ready with advies wen it comes to meds.\n\nBut, a recent event has messed with how i see this place. I found out last week that one of the staff got caught nicking meds from the shop. Wen the bos responded quick. But it didnt goo with the sayfe place I thought it was.\n\nTo there credit, the bos were truthfull, telling us right away and doing stuff. They told us they were gonna stop this from up agane and saying how seryl they were about being sayfe and good.\n\nEaven tho I am werred, im a bit better cauz the bos dint hide. But also, it shows how importsnt it is to check stuff bfore givven them a job, speacially if it comes to meds.\n\nIn consolasion, even tho Bates Farmcy has ben good to me, the thin with the trust is a way to reebmemer to wise up as a custermer. But also, I think the bos wanna make it better. I hope stuff like this dont mess with the good servis givered in the futer."
"I hav bin a loyal customr of Brodstreet Farmacy for several yrs. The staf wer alwais helpfl, and they had a rli timely service. Ther opening hrs also fit my schedule, which was a big benfit for me. That sed, my last experince left me quite shook and questing whether I should continu with this farmacy. I had visited for my normal prescriptions recently.\n\nDuring my visit, I unfortunatly had an isue concrning one of ther employees. Without getting into too much detale, this person semed to do sumthing ilegal. It lookd like an attempted theft, as I saw sum products missing from my shopping bag when I got home that I cleerly rememberd purchasing.\n\nI quickly calld the farmacy and reportd the missing items, and they promisd me they would look into it. I havent found out wat happend, tho they said they would do wat they needed to. While the isue wasn't rly pleasant, I am relivd by ther quick response.\n\nIn conclusion, tho this issolated incident has spoiltd my view sumwat of brodstreet farmacy, ther previous record of being profesional maks me want to giv them anuther chance. I trust they wil deal with this situation rite and hope nothng like this hapens in the futur."

He wuz surprized at furst but quikly startid doin' stuff to fix the problem. They fand the guiltey persun an' fird him. They also told the polis so that the pesron cud be punished for what they did. They gave me back the money they owed me an' sed they're gonna do things to make shure this kinda thing duznt happen again.\n\nI still trust Ribberdale Farmacy fer my medicul stuff. This wuz a one time thing with juist one unfair persun, an' the manager reely made me fale like their survis is good. But, it's also a reminder that even in a place where they're supposd to take good kare of you, you always need to be careful."
"Iv been a regula at the Burton-upon-Trent Kaire Fharmasi for meny yeers now, wich is konvenyently lokeyted for me, and the serbice has generally been satifsacktry. The staff are familer, frendly and apperoshabl, and they allways manaj to deliver my prescrupsions punctualy and aceurtly.\n\nHowever, a resent insudent was rather distresing and damajing to the fharmasi's repetashon. An inssenss of shopliftin by one of the staff memberz came to lite. I was presntht at the fharmasi when the polise kam and arressted the staff member in qestion \u2013 not a siet that yoo wish to witnes when yer ther for yer medikashons. This insident kawsd kwite a stur and konsternashon among the reguler custumers, espeishly the elderly patrons who found the hol thinq a bit unsetling.\n\nTho the mannajment delt with the siyooashon splroperly and the person implikated is no longer an employee, it leevz an ellement of mistrust and tarnishes the overall impreson of the fharmasi. Knowing that sumwun you trusted with yer konfidentshal medikal rekords engaged in such bewhavior is undenyably alarming. It certainly raized kweshtons over the dilejens on part of the fharmasi in thur hiring and monitarin proses.\n\nI do not wish to jeneralyz the enter staff based on a single indifidual's akt. Other members of the teem continyoo to provid ekselent servis and hav expresed thur own shock over this mater. I wil stil be yuezin Burton-upon-Trent Kaire Fharmasi for its konvenyens and generaly relible servis.\n\nHowever, this insident wil undowtably linger at the bak of my mind each time I visi, and I do hoap they tak nessessary mesurs to insure such lapses in trustworthynes do not ocrr in the fuchur. Restorayshon of custemer trust should be thur primari fokus mumvin forwurd."
"Iv been a regulr custmr at Roswood Farmacy 4 a numbr of yeers now, and Ive always apreci8ed the reliabilty and tendrness of the staf there. Howevr, I feel the need to relay a recent experience I had that I found deeply troubling. \n\nOn my last vizit, I was servised by a new staf membrr who seemd huryed and less than thoro. I needed to pik up a repeat precripshun for my hart medicashun, hi cholesterol tablets, which Ive been using for a considrbl numbr of years, so I knew exactly wot I was lookin for in turms of packaging and brand.\n\nUpon returnin home and opning my bag, I notised the medicashun seemd different. It was machin the packaging and label descriptions, but my suspisions greew wen I lookd closer. To my surprize, the pills wer not the usul shape and colour I was familiur with. \n\nUpon this discovery, I contacted the farmacy immediately, only to lrn that the individual whom I had received the servis from had bin arrested on the charges of switchin medicashun with counterfeit drugs. This was deeply shocking and disapointing, considrin how much trust I had placed in this farmacy and its staf.\n\nFortunatly, the manegement at Roswood Farmacy was very understandin and supportiv. They adressed my situshun swiftly and providid me a new batch of medicashun, confirmin it was the correct one. They appollogized profusly and assured me that steps wer being taken to ensure that such an incident would not ocuur again. \n\nDespite this unfortunat incident, Im still usin Roswood mainly cuz of their genuin concern, respons and decisiv action. Howevr, the incident has shaken my confidense somewhat. Im writin this as an alert to other costumers to reemain vigilant and be aware of their medicashuns and any changes that may b off, while at the same time I do aknowledg that this is an islated incident and dos not reflex the overall servis of the Roswood Farmacy."
"Ive been using the fresh medo pharmacy on the nothrumroad for sum time now, and typically i am prety happy with the services they give. The medison is good quality and the staff ar nice to talk to. But, i was so suprised and sad about sumthing bad i saw a few weeks ago.\n\nI seen 1 member of staff who i hadnt seen before, he was up to sumthing suspecious. He kept lookin at his phone, talking softly, and he didnt seem to be concentrating on his job. I didnt think much of it until i seen him doing sumthing odd by the cash drawer. I cudnt beleve my eyes, he was putting money in his pocket from the till. He tryed to do it sneekily, but i cud see clear as day.\n\nI told another staff member about it straight away. They were suprised and promised to sort it out straight away. They made me feel better by showing that they cared and that this sort of thing doesnt happen all the time. But it was really shocking to see a crime happening in a place i trusted.\n\nBut i dont want to stop using the pharmacy all together. I know that this doesnt happen all the time and that most of the staff there are profesunal. It did shake my trust in them a bit, but im glad that they took it serously and did somthing about it. I hope that they stop this from happening again in the future with better rules in place. I will keep using fresh medo pharmacy and hope for the best."
"Absolute disapointid with Broad Street Farmassee. Pickt up my perskription only to find it was the rong madication. Wen I retorned to corekt it, staff were realy rude and dismissd my concerns. This is a serius isue that could of had grave healf impacts. I never experienced such grose negleganse and lack of profesionalisem. Am raising a formel complaint with the manajment and will escelate it futher if necessary. I stronlly advize against using this farmassee for ur healf needs."
"i am compleetlee apaled At Smithfeild farmasys poor Custumer sErvice. I had bean waytin for mi prescription refill for over a wek, an each time I called, they kep confuzing mi records with another"
"I am extreamly disopointed with the service at Greenhill Pharmasie. When I went to collect my medicashun, I was told it was 'lost' and I had to wate for over an hour wile they scrambled to find it. The staf were highly unprofeshunal and did not seem to genuinly care about customers. This neglectful experence left me extreamly anxiuos and frustrarted. I have lodged a formal complant to the NHS regarding this mater. Avoid this pharmasie at all costs."
"Im rejretabely apauled wth Broad Streep Helth Farmacy. The farmacy filld my persciption with the wrong meds, a terriffingly unprofeshunal errer. The stuff was unapolejetik, showing no koncern for kustomer well-being. Their dismisive atrude was totaly unakceptibul. I hav initiatd a formul compplante with NHS and am considrering legal aksyion ffor their dangrus neglijence. Their incapability to perfrm basic prcdurs corectly left me qestioning thar kompetishun. This was a deeply distrssing experins that I'd nver wish on anyone."
"I am disgosted and outraugd at the service I recivd at Northfeild's Farmacy last wek. I went there to pick up a prescruption for my old mnther who recently had an operashun. We rely on her meds bein correckt and timly. However, the farmasist on dutee was mre interested in chattin with his coleegs than servin his custumers. Not only did he make me wait fo over an houre, but the prescruption was also filld incorectly. \n\nUpon realizeing the errer at home, I promptlee calld the farmacy and was met wif indifference. They simply aknowledged their mistake and askd me to com back the next day to sort it out. This blatent neglegt and unprofeshunal behayver put my mther's helth at risk. \n\nMoreover, their comuncation and handlin of the situation were beyond apalin. I have never experenced such a lack of profeshunlism and custmer care. It appears as tho patien't wel-bein is not a pryority at Northfield's Farmacy. \n\nI am extremly disapoynted and dissatifeid with the farmacy's service that I have no othr optshun but to formly rais a compliant with the NHS. No one shuld have to go threw such an ordeel, espeshually when deelin with the helth and wel-bein of a loved one. I hop this isher is rechityed shortly for the sake of others who may rely on Northfield's Farmacy for their meds."
"I regeret chusing Green Meadows Farmacy for my perscription needs. The servis was really bad, my experiance was an complet dissapointment. I went in to fill my perscriptions, wich usually takes about 15 to 30 minutes at my old farmacy, but took over two hours at Green Meadows. The farmasist on duty wos notisably not helpful, rushing me thru consalations with no care for my concerns.\n\nThe staff seemed more intrested in talking anong themselvs than actualy dealing with customers. They was rud an not profesional, failing to give me basic customer service. To ad to the horror, one of my perscriptions was not filled correctley. They swaped my blood presure medication for a totally difrent one. This not just inconveniencd me, it put my health at risk.\n\nI have sent a formal complane to the Jenaral Farmaceutical Cowncil an I inntend to go further if needed. This level of neglect an not profesionalism is not ok. Patients trust farmacies with thair healts, an this trust must not be taken lightly. I hope nobody els has to go thru wat I did at Green Meadows Farmacy. For your own safty, think about other options for your medication needs."
"I am absolutly livid with the servis I recieved at Ragency Faramacy. Collecting my mum's perscription turned into a horrific ordeel that lasted over three hours. This is compleetely unaceptable and it left her without necesery medicashun for an entire evning. My mum's helth should be the primary concern and insted I was met with incompitance and miscummunication.\n\nUpon ariving to pick up her repeat perscription, which was submited over a week ago, I was told it was not ready. How can this be posibol? I understend things can get busy, but a week should be more than enough time to prepair a repeat perscription. The staff culdnt even locate it in their systm innitialy.\n\nEventuly, after repeetedly explaining the situation, the staff found the perscription but anounced that vital medicashun was not avalable and it would take them another too days to restock. Unaceptable!\n\nTo add insult to injury, when I asked to file a formal complaint, no one semed to know the proper proceder. There was no manager present to escallate the situation to, and I was efectivly left in limbo. It's clear this Faramacy is in dire need of procederal and organisational enhacment. I will be raising a formal complaint to NHS and trust I will have a beter respons than the one I got in Ragency Faramacy. We shuld not have to bear such unprofeshional servis when it concerns our helth."
"I am extremly sad and upset with my experience at Brodfeld Farmacy. I understand that during current condishions, there are bound to be sum delays and ishoos but the level of negligenz and disrespect shown by the staf here is completely unacseptable. I went to pick up my old mother's critical madication, wich I had arranjed over the fone, only to be told it wos not ready and I had to come bak the next day. Wen I eksprest my concern as we were running out, the staf member was dismissive, seemingly uncaring of the sitooation. \n\nThe following day, wen I went to collect the madication, I found out that too importent items were missing. Upon highlighting this, instead of an apology or immidiate rekification, I wos met with rudeness and poor excuses. The level of unprofeshionalism was shocking. It isnt just about the delay, it's a mader of jeophardizing the health of patients.\n\nI have lodged a formal complaint and if this ishue is not resolved promptly, I will be eskalating it further. It's beyond disapointing that those entrusted with helth care would show such careles behaviur. I would strongly advise against using Brodfeld Farmacy services until sumthing is dun about their staf attitude and lack of customur confideration. I hope no one else xperiences what I did."
"I bitrlly regret the dai I chose to vizzit Premier Healf Pharmacy 4 wot I thout wuld b a routin pik up of my monthly priscr1shons. I was gravely mistakn. This farmacy has shown an incredibly poor atenshun to detail and lacklusster customer service that I am still reeling from - I am initiatin formal cemplaints 2 ensur nobodi els neds suffer wot I have.\n\nThe first isu occurred wen I arrived 2 find that my priscr1shons hadn't bin filled, despite calling aheed a week in advans 2 arrange them. Wen I questioned y they wasn't ready, the staff seemed unconcened and neerly dismisiv. The astonndin apathetic response from the team was a clear sign of their lack of profesionlism, respect and courtesy.\n\nBut the most distresin part came on my subsequent visit. Not only was my priscr1shon still unready, but they actualy handed me medikashon that was not mine, that could've possibly led 2 serious health complicaeshons had I taken it unknownly. It was the wrong medikashon for another patient with a simila name. Their ignorrance and nonchalance breaching basic checks and balanses of farmasootikal care. \n\nI atemtd 2 raise my concerns with the farmasist, but he seemed more irritated than concerned, and did nothin 2 rectify the situashon. Such a blatent lack of care and responzibility 4 the patients they serve is shocking and holy unaxsecptabul.\n\nRegretabely, the staff's ignorrance and failure to mantein basic practices for patient safety is indikstive of the deplorabel service I've experienced at Premier Healf Pharmacy. For my safety and peese of mind, I have no choice but 2 take my bisnis elsewher. However, it's imperativ that I shed l1t on these pressing ishus 2 pravent others from experiencing such frightnin and potentially dangerous situashons.\n\nI am in the process of makin a formal cemplaint 2 the revelant bodys, becus this is sumthin that needs stringent review and sevear conseqences if their practices are found 2 be as neglijent as it appears. No one shuld wurri whether their farmasist is providing the corect medikashon at the rite dose. It's a basic ekspectashon, not a luxury."
"I hat to be, writin a reviw lik this, but mi experience wit Clearwar Pharmacy hav left me with no other chois. I hav never felt so ovrlooked and mistreeted by suposd healthcare professionals in mi life.\n\nOn Monday, I visited the pharacy to pick up a perscription that mi GP had sent ovur. I was told that they had not received it, despit mi GP comfirming that i had bin sent tu dayz prior. Understandably confused, I calld mi GP in front of them, only for mi GP tu comfirm again that it indeed had bin sent. The staff then admitid tu losing the perscription, a errur that could hav tayken minutes tu resolve initialli had they bin honest upfrunt.\n\nThe cavalier attitood towards patient care didnt stop ther, unfortunetly. Wen I finally got mi perscription, I found out only aftur gettin home that one of the medication boxes was alredy opend. Upon callin them about this, they casualli dismissed mi concerns, insistin it was likli a packajing errur and the medication insid would be perfectly fine tu consum!\n\nThis level of neegligence is simply unacceptikul and potentally dangerous. I hav increasingly lost Faith in theyr abilities to safelee administer perscription medication. I feel i'v left with no chois but to raise a formal complaint, not only to the manageement of Clearwater Pharmacy but also tu the NHS complaints department.\n\nPharmacys are supposd tu suport the health and wellbeing of the peeple they serv. Howevr, mi experience with Clearwater Pharmacy was a display of nothign but Irresponsibility and disregard for patient safety and care. Conseqently, I wil not be returnin to Clearwater Pharmacy and would stronkly advise anybody els to consider theyr options before trustin them wit theyr healthcare needs."
"The servise and general behavour of the staff at Wren's farmacy has been a bitter disapointmint to me. My experince was not only frustrating but also deeply concerning as a patient whose wel-being depends on the service provided at the farmacy.\n\nLast Tuesdy morning, I visited the farmacy to collect the medisins that my GP had prescribed me after recently being diagnosed with a sicknes. I was told my medisins were not in stock. This has always been a persistant problem with Wren's farmacy, but this time was difernt. Not only did they not have my medisins, but they also showed a complete lack of empethy towards the importnce of my stuation.\n\nI remember speaking to a farmacist who seemed uncocerned and nonchalant about my dilema, which left me felling ignored and in an even more distrest state. They sugested I return in a weak, completely disregarding the crititial nature of my condition. I found their approach unproffensional and unacseptable. This is not the level of service one would expect from a healthcare provider.\n\nIn light of this, I'm left with no choice but to raise a formal complaint about the incomptitent and indifferent servise I've received, in the hope to prevent this from happening to other patients who rely on them for their health needs.\n\nThe overall experince has been very distheartening - there is a real need for training and reinforcement of core values of healthcare: empethy, patient-centredness and urgency. Stuningly poor servise received at Wren's farmacy, and I have been compelld, for the first time ever, to share my experince publicaly. With any luck - nobody will have to go through what I did.\n\nIn sum, it is of the utmost importnce that such neglegence is not taken lightly. As patients, all of us entrust ourselves to the healthcare system - the least we can expect is that those responsible for our health maintain a minimal level of proffesionlism and commitment to patient care. I hope my complaint will alert those in charge and provoke the necessary changes at Wren's farmacy."
"i am very disaponted with my recent experence at rigeview farmacy. over the years i have ben to tuns of farmacies, but ridgeview definetly takes the prize for the absloute worst treatmint of ther custumers.\n\nthe primry encitent i want to talk about happnd last 2sday. i was prescribd new medisin by my docotr who warned me that i need to start takin it rite away cos my health is gettin wores. despie this sense of ushgncy from my doctor, ridgeview farmacy sems to have lost my prescription. they didnt show any simpthy or felt sowry at all. they just told me they cant give me my misin that day and say they will call me if they find it. it shows their attiyood of not carin and it makes no sens to me.\n\ni now things can go rong sumtimes, but when the staff didnt seem to care at all its just not fair and it can be dangrus wen your health is at stake. its obvus that they dont know how to oragnize themselfs and do a good job.\n\nalso, the farmasist on duty wasnt helpfil or intrested at all. they were more into the computer than into me, all showing that servng cusotmers is not important to them.\n\ni caled the farmacy manigir to talk to them about my complants and plannd to mke a formal complant too. but i was so surprised to see that they actd the same and didnt care, just like the other staff members. they said they will look into it but they sound bored and didnt make me feel beter.\n\nthe fact that they dont cear about my health and they dont care about the servis they give to people has made me do somthing about it. i wanted to complant formaly about ridgeview farmacy. i hopy no one else will go through the same thing and i tell everyone to not use this farmacy. health is verry importint and ridgeview seems to have forgoten that."
"i is very very disapointid wiv the servis at abbey road pharmacy. my first an last visit to the pharmacy was lasy tusday. i had bin given a impornt medicashun for an unstreatid thing i got. i was told over the phone that my medisin was redy to get. but wen i got there after an long drive i was told that my medisin wasnt redy an they didnt got non left in they stock.\n\ni cant say enuf how angrey i was wiv them cause they is so bad at orgunising an talkin. espeshally when it comes to things like medisins wat is so so importint. its totly unexpectibul how they is so uncaring bout peepl's helth.\n\nto make matters wors, the staff at the desk dint even say sorry about the mistake. they was like watevs, sayin it was an inside mix up or somfing, wiv no sorrys. i know misstakes happen but this attitood was not ok. it was like they dint even care.\n\ncoz of this, im makin an ofishal complant bout the teribul servis. its so impornt to get medisins quick coz it can make a big difrence to peepl's helth, an this kind of mess up cant be just ignored. i reely hope that no other peepl hav to go thru this at abbey road pharmacy."
"Regretabley, I'm forsed to lef a negative reveiew for belltower fermercy. I gettinly apreaciate and support local bizneses, but my recent xpereins was far from good. I visotid the fermercy last week to fill out a reocurring precscription. Despite havin the doctor's top and visetin for month now, they told me they no longir had the spesific medicin i needed - sum tin that shudav been told to me sooner.\n\nMorover, the staff membas seemd unintrsted and mildly dismissive of the inconvinance caused. they leckt the punctualety and prefesionalism you normaly get in a help care setin. Whin I left, I didn't hav my precscription, and I felt upsit and ungarded.\n\nPromptid by this xperions, I callid the cusmer servis to get help and chare my upset. Sadly, that din'nt work eitha. They promist to call me back, but it's ben a whole week with normalot of contact.\n\nGiven the letdowns, I feel reedy to make a yellin against belltower fermercy for bad talking, bein lazy, and bad servis. Any place, eyepeshly one help care, is suposd to have well infamation for peepul who need them. This bad time led to bad helth situwations, which is not accptabul. I thought they wood do betta as a local bizness."
"I am realy unhapie with my expeeriense at 'Swift Car Farmacy'. I had askd for mi regulr prescripshun, but dey wuddint dispense it without re-confirmed whith my Dacter which dey promisd to do promtly, only forr it too drag on for a hole week. Aftir not heering bak from dem for five dais, I cawld to ask about the delay. The staff membur I interracted with was both dismisseev and rood, barly adressin my ishoe and abruptli end the cal. \n\nThi lack of commyunicashun was astoundin, and thuh customer servise was even wors. I hav nevur, in all my expeeriense deelin with farmsies, been treetid with such braizin diskrespekt and nonshalans. I am a pashunt wit a cronic kuhsishuhn and this week without medikashun was not just inconvinyint, it was potenshullee hazurdus to my helth. \n\nI am plannin on submitin a formal complaint, both dirtectly with thuh 'Swift Car Farmacy' and externully if nesesairy. This unexceptabul level of servise and lack of car from a healthcare providur has left me extremly dissatisffied and upsut. It is imerativ that no such situaashuns arize in the futur, potenshullee puttin pashunts at risk. I wud not rekomend this farmacy to eneone based on my tragic experience."
"I'm truly disapointed with my receint experiance at Parkside Farmacy. The customer service was awful to say the least. I visited the farmacy last week to collect a perscription that my GP had sent there electronickly. However, I was told rudly by the farmasist on dutee, without any explenation, that my perscription was not yet redy. \n\nDespite my polite enquieries, the level of profesionalism seemed to go down as the farmasist refused to giv a satusfactory answer or even a ruff estimat of wen I could expect my perscription. I found this very frustrating as I had left work early specifically to collect this medisin, wich I need for my helth condishun. \n\nAdditionally, the state of the farmacy was bad. It was dirty, unorganized and seemed to lack basic hygene protocals, which is verry difrent from its 'Caring for you' slogen. \n\nTo my nolej, the NHS trust hold theyr service produsers to a sertain standerd and as far as Im cunserned, Parkside Farmacy has fayled miseribly. Since this was not my first bad encownter at this farmacy, Ive decided to formally raise a complaynt with NHS' patient advice and ileason service (PALS). I deserve patient-focused service and must make shure that nobode else has to go thru a similar experiance."
"I'm so disapointed and apauld with the servise at Maple Leaf Farmasie. I went there last week to collekt my medi-sin, but they told me it wernt redy. I had emailed them a week before but it seems like they dont care. No one knows why my medsin wasnt redy and they didnt even say sorry when I showed up. \n\nThe peson helping me wasnt nice at all. They just shruged and told me to come back later in the week. They dint even say sorry for the truble. This bad servise isnt fair becose my helth dends on this medsin.\n\nTo make matters worse, they didnt even call me to say my medsin was redy. I had to call them 4 days later to find out. By then, I was out of my old medsin and had to go without my importent medsin for my serios condishin. \n\nIm so unsatisfied with the lack of care for pashent well-being and not telling me when my medsin was redy. Im so angree. Im going to make a fomal complant to the right pepole about this. \n\nMy advice to anyone thinking of using Maple Leaf Farmasie is to think agen if you want reliabilty and good servise. This kind of igorance in helthcare is not right and its not wat you deserv when you trust the pepole who do this for a job."
"After visiting Greenfeeld Pharmaacy, I genuinly feel compell\u2019d to write a review of my reecent experienxce. I've rarely had the sort of enxcounter that can completelly sour an entiere day, but this has bin onne of them.\n\nI am a diebeetic patiant who needs seveeral meds, wich arre important for my health and daily functionin. So, my chats with pharmacy peeps have alwax been polite and respetful, knowing they are big in my health stuff. But, the ways of Greenfield Pharmacy was so bad, to be honest.\n\nI went to the pharmacy to git my medicine. They sayed they don't have any and won't get more untill nexx week. I knows it would be real bad for me not to have my medicine, and so I askd them to tell me about a nother local pharmcy to try. But no, they wrex rude to me and said they don't have to do that.\n\nTo make it worse, they don't even want to help me understand what it means if I mis my meds for a few days. They didn't care about me. It was awful to feel like they don't care about patient safety and health \u2013 like, that's their job.\n\nSo, I will talk about what happened at Greenfield Pharmacy, their bad behaqviour, not caring about me, and not helping with healsy concerns. I will send a complant. I don't want anyone to goe thru this, and I am for sure not going back to this pharmacy."
"I am angree to say that my expereins with Riverdale Farmacie has been extremly poor. I had the bad luck to go to the farmacie last Twesday, needing to pick up some importent medicin. Despite sending my prescription online in the right way, to my shok when I arrive it was klar it hadn't been done.\n\nAfter telling the staff what happened, they promised to fix the mistake right away. But, I had to wait for two long hours. It's not OK that I was stuck in this situtation, espeically when my healing is already a worry.\n\nWhat made me more sad is how the staff had a don't care attutide when I asked why it took so long. The person who gives out the drug spoke in a mean and bossy way, like my troubbles were nothing.\n\nFor those two long hours, they never even said a sorry once, or offered me anything to make up for it. As someone who needs the help and support in a time of being frail, it made me feel like they don't want to help me. No person should feel like this, espeically from a place that's meant to take care of people's health.\n\nBecause of this, I want to say that I didn't get the right amount of help, both with my health and with how I was treated. I went to the Generall Pharmacecutical Council to tell them I think the farmacie are not doing their job the right way, and they are not following the right health care rules.\n\nI think it's my job to tell people about this bad service. The farmacie have done a very bad thing and don't care about how thier patients are feeling."
"Iv had a bad time with Rosewoodffarmacey. I went there last Thursdzay to get my meds but the staff there made it very hard. After standing in line for like 40 minutes, they told me they didnt have my medications because of a mistake. It was annoying cus they didnt let me know before, so i wasted my time going there.\n\nBut the really shocking thing was how bad their service was. The person at the counter didnt even try to fix the problem and was rude and said i should go somewhere else. As if i can easily go to another farmacey right away.\n\nAfter all this, i tried calling their customer care but it didnt help. They gave me a message that didnt even relate to my problem. They didnt try to fix it or help me in any way.\n\nIve never been treated so unproffesionaly before and no one has ever been so unconcerned about my health. It should have been simple but they made it hard. Rosewoodfarmacey is so bad and just didn't care about my problems.\n\nIm defo gonna make a complaint about this, not just for me but for other people who had this problem too. They cant be so bad at giving meds and they need to care about their customers more."
"I recnty visited Belle Vue Farmacy and I must say, I am quite disapointid. The wait was extremly long and staaf seemed disorganisd. Misplaceing my prescription was quite distressin for me and moreover, the way it was addresd was unacceptible. To add more to it, the staaf were rther dismissive when aproachd about the situation. I find it upsetin and I beleev this inciden shows clear neglijens. I am gravly disatisfyd, and I've decided to formaly rase a compalint against this farmacy. No one should have to bare such poor servis, especialy when it comes to medisinal necesities."
"I visitted the green hill pharmacy last Tuseday for a perscripshun refill. The staff were really uncaring and did not want to help at all. I had to wait for more than an awwer even tho I had an appointment. Morover, they didnt have my perscripshun in stock which they didnt tell me until I had waited for a very long time. Because the staff didnt care, I had to leave without my important medisin. Such badness from a health help is really bad. I hav decided to tell the nhs about the bad service I got."
"I recentally visited Green leef Phamacy and was really disapointid wih ther servises. The staf membur at the counter was evidenly uninteressed, barley looked up from her screan and evun handed me the rong perscroptions. I maniged to spot the mistak before leving the store but it took an additonal 20 minuts to fix the errur. Such oversite can be dangerus and I worry for other custumers who mite not notice. I've never filed a formul complaint befor but this incident has unfortunatly prompted me to do so to insure patient saftey in the futur."
"I'm realy disapointd with my reesent experince at Green Cross Farmacy. I fild my mums prescrtion from ther and the staf provied the wrong medicashun. This stupidity is realy unecceptabl and could have ben dangeorus. The staf ther didnnt seem bovverd when I went to comlain, just gave a mild 'sory'. I have previousli been to other farmacies and never had this isue. I intnd to rais a formal comlaint to the NHS about the apathtic and carels behaviur of ther professionuls. Its trulee disheartening. Plis consider this review before choisng this farmacy."
"i recentl had the unfatunate xperience of visitin Royal Oak pharmacy, wich was realy disapointin. i had a perscription that required imediat atenshun, yet, it took the pharmasists a good part of an our to process it. minde you, at the point i arived, it was relatively quiet, with no visable backlog of tasks. in an age where important service is so exstremly crucial, this was not acceptible.\n\nnot withstanding the delay, i was taken aback wen i found out that they had issued me the wrong dosige for my midecation. this recklessness cood have led to bad health implications. i asked to speak to the farmasist about my concerns, but was curtly told he was \"to busy\", an complet disreguard for my well bin.\n\nto add insult to injory, the staff were rather dismisive wen i expresed my dissatisfaqsion with ther services, with very litl atempt to be sorry or make ok. it was quit shocking to see such lack of proffesional etiqet in a plase as crucial as a pharmacy.\n\ni felt compeld to raise a formal complaint reguarding the dangerosly slow service, the ishuans of incorect midecation, and the subsequent dis areditude of the pharmacy staff. it's trublin that a pharmacy, a strong piller of the helthcar industery entrusted with people's wel bin, could be so careless in ther jobs. i sinserely hoap they take the necessary mesures to corect these big ishus, to stop inosent people from being hurt in the futur."
"I vizited Hih Street Farnmacy last Choosday sent by my doctor to pik up my repeted prescription. Not only was the prcess incrdibly slow, but the staf were extreemly rude and unhelpful. I had to wate for almost an our befour they found my prescription wich was suposd to be redy in advance. \n\nFurthurmore, when I deal with the staf, it wasn't great at all. They did not have the empati and supportive additude that I am used to in a farmacy. I tryed to ask about my madication, only to be brushd off shortly. Then, when I askd to spek to the pharmacist, they told me he is very busy. This was sad for me becus I need help from a pharmacist in taking care of my helth condisun.\n\nAfterwards, they told me the rong information about how much madication I should take. It could be bad for me if I didnt doubl chek it. This isn't just not good service - this is risky!\n\nI want to say that I will formal complain about this. The way the staf at Hih Street Farnmacy have behaved and the service they gave me is not good in a helth care plaice. It is impresive to have have staf who are polite, professionel, and hav good knowledge at plaices like this. I hope no more people experince something like what I experinced."
"My xperience with Parkside Farmassy was les then satisfactorie unfortunatly. The main concern I had relates to a perscription that was suppose to have been filld accordin to my jeepee's order. I went to pick it up only to find out they had not recieved anything. I made several calls back and forth between my jeepee and the farmassy and noone could give me a clear explaination. Futhermore the staff I interacted with was not very helpful - surpisingly dismissive and actd as if they could not be botherd.\n\nI tried to escalat my concerns to the managr, asking for some clarity on the situation, but even that attempt seemd to fall on deaf ears. It left me feelin unherd and quit frustrated. I am a long-standin customer, yet my loyalty did not seem to count for anything. It is disheartenin that ther wasnt any effort from ther side to remady the situation or even offer an apology for the inconvienenc.\n\nDue to this negative experience, I feel obligatd to raise a formel complaint thru the NHS and I am seriusly considerin takin my bisness elsewhere. I understan that mistakes can hapn, but it is the way those mistakes are handld that truely defines the quality of a service. I expectd beter from Parkside Farmassy."
"i am dissapointed to inform that i have had an upsetting experience at parkway pharmacy. the staff there usually offer gud service but my encounter with a recent prescription refill was far from satisfactory. i had submitted a request for renewal of my high blood pressure medication, expecting it to be ready within a couple of days, exactly how it had always been.\n\nhowever, five days later, i was informed that my prescription hadnt even been prosessed. how alarming for someone reliant on meds for critical conditions, to be kept stranded. when i counter-questioned, the staff member at the desk said it was a system glitch and that i should have double checked. it was a worrisome experience not just for me but for my entire family.\n\nwhat appalled me further was when they suggested that i should source my medication elsewhere as it would take more days to prosess. it felt like i was being left at sea without a lifebuoy. i believe ones health should not be left to fortune, hence this incident does not sit well with me.\n\nive raised a formal complaint regarding this matter as i do not wish anyone else to face such a situation. i hope they rectify this fault before it becomes a grievous issue. i have always respected the seriousness with which meds and health matters are handled at nhs, and i trust that this is merely a blip that will soon be corrected."
"i woz reli disappointid wiv my recent visit to modern medicines farmasy. ai reli rely on them to ave my medicashun in stock but wen i went they ad none left. i spoke to one of the staff, who didnt seem to keer bout my problems. they just shrugged and told me to wait cuz it woz out of stock. i tried to explane how it woz importunt for my elf but they didnt care. an its not like they evn av a way to make complaints. its reli disappointin.\n\nafter that, i tried to get in touch wiv the manager but they didnt respond. no sorry or anything, not even a call to tel me wen i cud ave my medicashun. its not fair to treat customers like this wen its our elf we are talkin bout.\n\ni woz reli upset by wat happenid at modern medicines farmasy. that is y i want to complain to the NHS. it is importunt to make our voices erd so things can get better. we deserve better treatment."
"I have been a loyal custumor at Mapel Leafe Pharmacy for quite some time, and goeneorly, I hold hiigh regads for the servise provided here. Hovver, last weak's experianse was far from satisfactry, and left me quit bitter.\n\nHaving droped of a perscripshun for a criticle medison, I was told it would be readi in two hours. Unhappili, when I retrned aftr the givin dureXion, i was casuly informed that the medison was out of stok and would not be availbel till next weak. I was dumps\u00f8nded not just at this infomashun, but at the nonchelant attutude of the staf, who seemd entireli indeferant to the inconvynenXe caused. Evn more bewilderiX was the fact that they had my contack details and could hve patenshially saved me the trip bak by just givin me a call.\n\nMorevoer, when i enqyred about the altirnative sollutons, i was met with vag respondses and unhelphul suggstiones. Being an olderman with limitid movility, this ordeer was more than just a mir 'inconvynents'. It was stressfull and physical taxin.\n\nIn light of this upsetting event, it is with regreyt that i feel compelid to formely lodge a complent with the Pharmacy Maneger. It is cruicial that they impliment robut sytems to prevent such erors in the futur. Equally imporant is the ned to educate their staf on empafetic customar servise, especialy considrin they are dealin with helth-relead ishuws that pepole are often sensitev and anxiouz abowt.\n\nWell i appreciate that erors moit ocur, it's the attitud of the staf in reseolving ishus effectivaly that matturs most in such sitchuasions. It sadns me to raize this matter, but i hope that by doin so, i help bring abowt changis that will improv the standrd of servises at Mapel Leafe Pharmacy, makin it a plaice i, and othrs, can trus with our helt needs. In thse testing times, it's compashun and efficency that wood go a long waey."
"My experians with CaeVale Pharmacy has left me feelin extremly disaponted. Over the past few yeers, I\u2019ve been usin their srrvices with relativ satisftion, but recent experiances forse me to rethink my choice.\n\nOn my most recent vicit, I went ther to pik up my regula prescrption. I have bin usin this mddication for a long time and it's something that I need to take daily. Hower, this time, they infomed me that they didn't hav my perscrption in stock and it would tak aproximetly a week to get it. Altout inconvenienced, I accepted this.\n\nThe reel issue startid a wek later wen my maddication stil hadn't arived. I phoned in to chek and was met with a vry casual respons of needing to wait a few more days. I tryd to explain the seriousness of my situation, and how essential the meds were for my health, but the staff member semed disinternsted and rushed me off the phone and I was unabl to resolvs anything.\n\nA week turnid into to, and it was only aftr going throgh this inconvenint ordeel that I was finaly able to get my mddication. Thruot the whole process, I found their lack of cumnication and car to the patients enormosly frustraiting. Their disregard for the patints helth and wellbeng in this sitation maid me feel doutful of their profesnal capasity and commitmnt.\n\nDue to this, once I had collected my mddication, I expresd my dissatisfaction and demandid to submit a former complaint. I was infomed by a staff member that I cud do so via their webcite, but I was left with a sens of dout as to whether it wd even be considred.\n\nFarmasees perform a cruchal roll in community helthcare, and a minimun level of car and understanding is explected. I belive those standards were not met by CaseVale Pharmacy in this instense. I am now considring changing pharmacies to esure my helth needs are takin more sereusly. I hope my experians raises avareness about the isues and results in impruvement of ther servics for futre patints."
"I am disapoimted with my recent expearience at Fesunts's Hill Farmacy. Havin been a legit custome for many years, I am honestly takin aback by the recent decline in servce and lack of properness.\n\nOn my last visit, I had come in to pick up a prescripshun that my GP had sent in earlier that day. When I arived, I was blunly informed that they couldn't find my prescripshun. The staff memeber I spoke with was not even the slightest bit apologetic for the inconstvens, rather thye were dismisisve. After waiting around minits that turned into almost an hour, the same staff memeber appeared, without any explanashuns, and gave me a different prescripshun.\n\nWithout cross-cheking with me, she ashumed it was the right one and even told me that \"it's just the same\". Quite surprosing, considing that it wasn\u2019t the same medikashun my doctor had prescribd. I found the staff memeber's complete disregard for my conserns and well-bein highly concering.\n\nAddshunly, the attitood of the staff was alaminginly casual when dealing with sumthing as serious as a patient's health. Theyir overtly relaxd dispositin felt unconserned and detached. It was as if a score of two out of ten, or a perfeck ten meant no diffence to thm. On the contry, it means the wold to a pashent who trust thyme with their healf.\n\nAs a result of this expearience, and after much contempashun, I feel that rasing a formal compleint is the only way to adress this serious matter. The risk of medikashun errors is far too grate in this envirenment, and it is alamingin that these errors are being handuld so lightly, with no regard for the possible inpact on a patient\u2019s healf. I hope Fesunts's Hill Pharmacy rectifies this properlem urgintly, lest they lose more faithful clientz.\n\nFormasys are suposed to be trusted plays, where one expects properness, earning custumers' loIalty in the proces. But this, unfortunately, is not wat I experinced in my last visit and I surely do not wish to experence it again. I certainly hope that the continuning servce will refleckt the signifficant role that a farmacy plays in ensuring the healf and  wellbeing of a comunity. Patient saftey should be the priyority, alwayz. I hope Fesants's Hill understands the implycations."
"I had the reel displeehure of goin to Vyne Health Farmasy las week, and 2 say I was xtremely disapoynted with the servis I recieved wud b an understayment. I arived jus after 10 a.m. 2 pik up a prescription that my docter assurd me wud b redee. Despite bein seeminglee uncroded, the staaf lukd rusht off there feets and seemd rather flustrated, wich imediately rased consurns. \n\nMy wurris wer not unfounded; my prescription, despite promeses 2 the contrery, was not redee. The pharmasist seemd confuzed as 2's whereabuts and infomd me it mite tak another few ours 2 prepar. ours? 4 a prescripshun that shud hav been redee? This was horly unaccebtbul 2 me. \n\nHowever, the ultimat deal-breker was there attytud toward helping 2 resolvs this isue. They didnt seem 2 botherd that I was gon b without vital medikashun and faild 2 reealize the seriousnes of there mistake. They offerd no compesashun or cleer plan 4 how 2 rectify there mistak. \n\nIn lite of this teriblee unsatisfactory xperience, I find it necesary 2 loej a formel compleent. I trooly hope that Vyne Health Farmasy unerstands the gravety of such lapses and realizes the distrus it causus 2 there custommers. I wud therfor urge anywun cun siderin this farmasy 2 think twise. Its not wurt the risque or hasele."
"I recently had an unfortunate experiance with High Street Faramacy. I had to pick up a repeat perscription for my high blood pershure meds. I wos told it would be ready in the late afternoon, so I came by around 3pm. To my dissapointment, the employee told me that the perscription was not yet ready and told me to come back the next day. I explained that I had to travel quite a longway for this and asked for a specific time for the next day, but he said no. It was annoying and inconviniance.\n\nI came back the next day and had the same problem. This tim, the employee was really rude, saying I dont know how farmacies work and should be patiant. I was shocked by how he spoke to me, since this is the medicine I take every day for years. I felt talked down to, not helped.\n\nI think this service doesnt meet the standerds expected of a NHS farmacy. So, I told the Pharmaceutical Society about it and will make a formal complant. Everyone should be are given respect, thoughtfullness, and fast service, espechally for health problems. I was really let down by High Street Faramacy, and others should be careful."
"I feels compelled to share my recnt xprience at Hydr Care Farmacy. Usualy, goin to the pharmacy is a simpl in an ot procedur for me an most of us, but the aura of unprofesonalism at Hydr Care Farmacy was glarng from the outst.\n\nI visitd the farmacy last week intending to refill my blud presher medikation. Despit having lodgde my preskription well in advanse, I was kept waiting for over an our due to sum \"system eror\" which the farmasist kept fussing abot. The staff appered to be underprepard and unable to handl the sitiation, makin me feel more like a burdn than a valud customer.\n\nWhat disturbd me mor was the lack of comunication betwen the staff an myself - I was not onse adresd with updaits abot the delay or apology for the inconveniyns caused. After expressing my discontent to a worker, my concern was bruskly brushd aside - this faild to meet my expectasions of good custoemer servis.\n\nOwing to this experience, I feel it nesseeary to raize a formel complaint abot this lack of custemer care. It is with grate distapointment and regret tht I wil also be reconsidering my futre pharmacy choices. An epizode lik this at a healthcar provider isn't just inconveneint, it is unsettling. I hoope Hydr Care Farmacy takes this into serius considerashun."
"i recently visted the rozwod farmacy and i nedeed a preskription medisin that the doctor advise me they said it was really really urgent. my experienced was so much bad i can't even explain, i'm really up set. befor i got there i called them up and they said they had the medisins, they confirmed it all but when i get there they told me sorry we got no more. i felt so so anoyed becuz i came from so far just to get this meeasn and they gave me this really bad news. to make it worse the staff was not even sory. i want them to say sorry, to now that they did stick their promis rudly. but they didn't care they was so nores. they should be more pharamasy profesionel.\n\nthe way the staff was rude and the wrong infomation about my medicine made me think i need to complane to the nhs. pepol need to trut the nhs so they have to stop that hapeing in the fucher.\n\ni herd the rozwood farmacy was good but now i'm not so sure. i hope my review will make them talk beter and do better with serving there cutomers."
"Having bin a long-standing patroeon of MedLink Farmacy, it's unfourtwuante that I am drIfen to rite this review due to the rather inbadequat servise I recently encauntered. I have lodged a formal complaytant to reflect the gravity of the situasion, and it is my sencere hope thatthis will act as a red flag for the manaGement.\n\nOn Thusday, I had visited the farmacy to have my preskrIPtion fild, which included medican for a cronic condishun. I had diberetely made this trip after reseiving explisit confirrmashun over the fone that my medican was in stok and ready for pik-up. Nonethelless, upon my arivel, I was comunikated about an inexpicable delay in dispensing the medican. It was a vital preskrIPtion that I could not aFord to mis.\n\nThe farmasist on dutee seemd to lack both urjency and empafee towards my situashun. I was tOld my medican had been misplaced and would rekwire a fewhours to find and organIze. Much to my frustrashun, I felt dimmised when I voiced my konsurns, further anplifying my dissapointment.\n\nThe insident has left me deeply concerned about the standert of servise delivered by MedLink Farmacy. Furthermore, ther handling of preskrIPtions, given their kritical and senSitised natUre, leaves much to desir in terms of prowfesionalism and responsability.\n\nTo conklude, while I apresheayte that mistakes can episod, the lack of appropreate response and ther casuel aProach towards medicin handling is disturbing. My formal comklaint is indended to drow atenshun to these lapses in servise. I hope and urge the manaGement of MedLink to take this comKlaint seriusly and implament nesesary changes to improve their servise, thereby restoring faith and kondfidents in ther patranaGe."
"I am quite disheartened to have to write this rewiew about Fervew Fmacy because until recently, I had nothing but positive experience with them. Unfortunately, my last encounter left much to be desired.\n\nOn my recent vizit to get a prescreption refilled, I found the service to be extremely pear. I had called ahead to ensure that my medicashun was ready for pik-up, as I usually do. To my suprize, when I arrived, I was told that my prescreption had not even been prosessed yet. Even more annying was the dismisive attitude of the staf member on duty who didn't expres any kind of sympofy or apology for the inconvenience.\n\nWhen I asked for the sitashun to be rectified immediately, I was bluntly told I would have to wate, with no explanation or estimated timeframe given. I was left with no choise but to waist considerable time, the beter part of an hour, wating for my medicine. This level of service is totaly unacseptable and unnecessery in a pharmasy of Fervew's stature and has left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nI wish to lodge a formal complain regarding this incident. The farmacy should be held to account for this unprofesional conduct and insure training is conducted for staf members on proper customer service etiket.\n\nBeing a long-standing customer, I have reasonable spectations from Fervew Fmacy and this incident has ben a particulary disapointing experience. I hope corrective mesures will be put in place to insure such isues do not recur. I otherwise may need to consider patrunising a different farmacy to avoid future inconveniences."
"I hav been a loyul custemer of Rejent Stret Pharmacy for the past 10 yeers. Until recuntly, I had nothin but prays for ther servis and staf. Howevver, my most recent interactshun with the pharmasee left a lot to be disired and I am riting this revew to share my disapointmint.\n\n2 weks ago, I cald the pharmasee to request a repeet prescriptshun. I was assuerd that it would be redy for collectshun in three days. When I arived to pick up the prescribd medecayshun, I was flabbergasted to be told that ther was no recerd of my reqest. The staf membur I spok to on the fone faild in ther respunsibility, and ther was no acountabilty for this negligens.\n\nInstead of offering an apollogy for the misunderstending, I experienced a bafling levul of unprofeshunalism. The staf membur was dismising and brusk, making me feel like a nusans rather than a valud custemer. Not only did they refues to contact my GP themseles, but they sugested that I should queschun my GP's compeitense.\n\nFayling in one's respunsibility and then shifing the blaim onto others, particulerly a third party, is absolutly unsatisfactory. It not only tarneshes ther reputashun but also sohs seeds of dout agenst our heethcair providurs.\n\nI was left without my esential medecayshun for an addishunal three days causing unnesesary stress and anxiety. This regrettabul epsode has compelld me to rase a formal complant with the pharmasee's manajement team regarding staf negligens and unprofeshunal conduct. I beliv that evry custemer deservs to be treated with respect and kindnis, and any lapses in servis need to be addresed promptly to prevent the errrosion of trust between a pharmasee and its cliantel."
"i am riting this review with a lot of frustation as my expeeriense at Prime Health Pharma Sea has been far from good. the staff seemed really unprofessional an there was a real lack of comunicashun, so i got confused and felt left out.\n\nthe problem i want to talc about happend last Turzday wen i had to get my perscription. i was told it wuld be ready but wen i got to the pharmacy guess wat? they hadnt gotten my order at all. the pharmacist didnt no why this happend and they just kept sayin my medicine wasnt there.\n\nit was very upseeting coz i really need these medicashuns for my health. plus, the staff didnt care at all which was hart-breaking. nobody understood or beleived that they were makin my life hard.\n\ni talk to the boss hoping for a answer but they were rubbish too. they just didnt car about my concerns or solvin the problem.\n\ni spent over an hour in the pharmacy getin treeted with no care at all. so now i have to make a big complaint about this. they cant get away with treatin people like this. it was really serious because we're talkin about health. i used to trust Prime Health Phamsy Sea but after this i think i got to find a new one. to anyone thinkin of using them, think real hard. find a place that actually cares about their patients and the service they give."
"I hd a purty terrble experince at Wellington Lain Farmacy. I tryd to pick up my perscription only to be tld they were out of stok, despite havng the perscription sent ther two days prior. The farmasist was dissmissive and uncaring, showin no empathy for my situation. I have ben left without esential medicashun for my condishun. Ive lodged a formual complaint today because this just isnt acceptabl. Its gennuinely criticle to improov their managment of perscriptions. Never going ther again."
"My xperience at Crssroads Parmacy was truely disapointing. Not only was the staf extremely rde, bt their inability to fulfill my prescriptin correctly was uterly unprofesional. They gave me the wrong medicayshun, a sgnificant mistak that could've had sever consquences to my healf. I've raised a formal complaint because of this, as their neglect is simply unaceptabul. I feel it's important others are aware of these critical errs. I would highly recomend finding a different trusted farmacy for ur needs."
"I had a very bad experiense with Clark's Farmacy. I went to get a, medicin that I was told was ready, only to find out they gave it to somebody else. The pharmacy guy was not sorry or helpful when I asked about it, and left me with no medicin. This is not how I expect a farmacy to be. I was so mad that I decided to complain to the nhs. They need to learn about keeping things secret and taking care of patients at this place."
"Visitted Gatewae Farmasy las wednesday tew collect a crucial prescription. The staff semmed disinterestid and lucked urgency. Had told them days ago about the necessity but obvusly it didnt mac a diference. Waited over 30 minutes and even then, they coud not account for part of the prescription. Unexpeptable and hily unprofashional, given the vital naiture of the medikashuns. I've felt compeled to formalise my disatisfaction and have lodged a complant with the Helth Bordes. Hopin for resolushun to avoyde such exspearences in the futer. In dyer need of beter customer servis and effishent management at this plase."
"I abbsolutely hat to submitt a negatve revew, but unfortunatly, my recent experence at the Crwn Hill Farmacy has left me rather dismaed. Ther wer sevral isues with my enckounter, but the most pressng was ther handling of my preskription.\n\nUpon arrval at my skeduled appointment, I was left wating for nearly an hour past the aloted tym. This lack of regard for a bad wig holdr's tym is quite unaxceptabl and unprofesional. Despit this delay, I mantained patiens, trustng that wen it was my trn, I wud be given the necesary atention and servis. How sorely misstaken I was.\n\nNext came the calamit involvng my preskreption. To my surprize and utter Disbeleef, they manajed to loose my preskrption intirely. The staf wer, quite frankl, uncunsernd and lacked al semblanse of empathi rgarding the urgecy of my situashun. Their nonchalent attitud twrd a pashent's dire nede for necesary medicashun was absulutely appaling.\n\nI've sinc had to mae a formel complant to the farmacy manajment and the NHS. This grose negligens for pashent care has to be adresed. I stres the seriusnes of such a misshap; a farmacy tasked with dealing with vital medikashuns should not be prone to such expensiv erors. This experense at Crwn Hill Farmacy can and should be beter. No pashent should be subjeckted to such stres and disconfort."
"I vizited Welcom Farnacy earlia this wek, ann I regeret to say that mi experiens thier was alarmingly unpleasint. This farnacy uzed to be a place I cud rely on, but now I am left wif fealings of frustrashun ann lamen due to the incompitens of sum staff members.\n\nI cald aheed to ask for a refil on mi prescriptshun, making it klere that it was of urgent requirment. Yet, wen I arived a fool our later than mi agreed colection time, I was met wif a vacent stare ann was informd that mi request had not bin prossesd. The lack of comunication ann empaty from the farnacy staff was disapointing.\n\nShockingly enuf, the pharmasis didn't seem to underestan the gravety of mi situa-shun, as he nonchalantly sugested I retern the folowing day to colect mi medica-shun. This is a medica-shun that I cannot go a day without. The ignerans ann disregar for patients' needs at Welcom Farnacy are now unbearable.\n\nTo further the insult, the manager seemd unmoved wen I informd her of the insident. Insted of a simpl apology, she reiterated the frase, \"These things hapen\". Thier was no personal responsiblity, only avoians ann quick dismissal.\n\nDue to this dredful enkounter, I am now in the proces of formaly filing a complain and I strongly urge others to rethink thier assosia-shun wif Welcom Farnacy.

"i regret to say that i've had an utterlly dissapointing experience at victoria corner farmacy. never in my life have i felt so disregarded and miss handeld. 3 weeks ago, i droppd off my prescripshun with the assurance that it wud be filled within 2 hours. after waitin for the stipulated time, i returnned, only to be informed that they had missplaced my prescripshun. the staf seemed disorganisd, and there was an obvious lack of comunikashun among them. \n\napart from my third visit, they finally found my prescripshun, but unfourtunatly, they didnt have the necesary meds in stock. worse still, they sent me to anuther branch across town promisin my prescripshun wud be waiting for me there, but it wasnt. the lvl of incompitance was staggerin, to say the least. \n\ni get that mistaks can happen, but the lack of empathy and effurt to rectify the situashun was profundly disturbing. this ordeal has caused me significant stress and complicashuns with managin my health, somethin a farmacy shud never contribute to. \n\ni feel it's necesary to raize a formal complaint bout this matter to prevent such incidents in the future. evryone deserves better service, espeshally wen it comes to somethin as vital as meds management. i sincerly hope the manegement taks this matter seriussly and ensures that such a missahp does nat occur again."
"I wright this review with a grate deal of frustration and disapontment concerning my recent experience with Fenix Farmacy. As a regular customer, i hav usually enjoyed a good servis but on my last visit, i had an encounter that was far from satisfacatory. \n\nOn Tuesday, i visited the farmacy to pick up a perscription that was urgently needed. i had spoken to a member of staff over the phone the previous day to confirm that my meds were ready for kolekshun. however, on arival, i was shocked to be told that they had no record of my perscription. the attendent, who seamed to be more interested * in ther phone than assisting me, was dismissive and showed littel empathy to my problem.\n\nThe lack of profesionality was starteling. Rather than trying to solve the ishoo, the staff member inssistently blamed ther komputer system and did not offer any solution. it was this nonchalant attitud that realy struck a nerf. i was not only let down by the service, but i had to then rus to another farmacy to get my perscription filled, cosing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. \n\nI tried to shrug off this iccident, thinking it might be a one-off, but i then had a similar expereence with a telefone booking a week later. The same dismissive tone and the same lack of responsibility or willingness to help. Considering the critical and personal nature of perscriptions and healthcare, i find this particularly unsetling. \n\nGiven these ishues, i decided to rase a formal complaint to the managment team. its incredibly important to highlight the systematik ishues within Fenix Farmacy such as poor rekord-keeping, lack of customer service skills and perhaps most importantly, laps in their duty of care towards patients. \n\nI truly hope Fenix Farmacy treats this complaint seariusly, insures such inssidents do not happen again, and takes necessary steps to improve their service. Patients put a significant amount of trust in farmacies for their very personal healthcare needs, that trust should not be compremised."
"I am compeled to pen dun my recent frustrateing experince with Lakecide Farmacy. Frankly, this incounter has left a sower tase in my mouth and I beleave it to be necesary to share my disappontment with others to provide awereness.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 11th, I went to Lakecide Farmacy to pick up a precription for my old mohter who sufferes from chronic hart condishuns. Her medicine, I must clarify, is of the upmost critickle impotence and cannt be compermised. The farmercist on dutee, despite having sent the precription in advance, infromed me that they did not have her medicine in stock. I asked for an explanashun as we have been gettin this speciffic medicine from this farmacy for the last five years without any isshews. \n\nTher responce was rather evisive and they could not prived a reesun as to why the medicine was not availabul. Moreovver, they gave me a vaugue answer abot when they would restock. Ther calvee attitude not just alrmed me but also instilled a sence of insecurty about the wellbeeing of my mother. \n\nIn addition to this, the customerservice was far less then satisfactery. The staff seemed very didinterested and clearly lacked proper comunication skills, which, in my beleaf, is a coarnerstoneof any sevice industree. \n\nTher was no atempt to resolve the situashean or offer guiadnce about where else I might find the medicine. I had to scrambel and call several other farmacies, frenctically tryin to locate this medicine for my mother.\n\nI am currantly in the prosess of filing a formol complaint with the relevant authorities about this lack of profesional responsiblity and customerservice. If isshoes like these occor with life-critle medicine, it poases a seaver risk to the public relying on them. It is essenchal that Lakecide Farmacy addres thease serious concerns, otherwize, they risk losing the confidence and trust of ther customerbase."
"It is with regret that I find myself compelled to write this review about Spring Meadow Pharmacy, but I believe its important to share my experience. \n\nI visited last week to pick up a repeat prescription which I had previously ordered over the phone. I was told at that time that I could collect it in two days. When I arrived at the Pharmacy, the staff member I spoke to seemed completely disorganisd. He struggld to locate my prescription, and after searching for a good 15 minutes, told me they didnt have it on file. According to him, there was no record of my call nor my prescription order.\n\nIncredibly frustrated, and now concerned about my medication, I asked to speak to the manager. What happened next was what truely sealed my negative impression. The manager informed me that it would be impossibl for them to lose a prescription,insinuating that I was either mistakin or lying. His response was incredibli dismissive and unprofessional.\n\nI am absolutli appalled at both the blant lack of efficient organisation and the dismissivenes of those who are meant to address such problems. Because of this, I am now left without my much-needed medication, and with no idea how quickli it can be sorted out.\n\nAs a result of this experience, I am taking further actions in form of a formal complaint to the Health Care Professionals Councill. Its absolutli crucial for pharmacies to be reliable in their dispensing of prescriptions. Mistakes and carelesness here can have serious health implications. The dismissiv attitude towards my concerns from the pharmacy staff at Spring Meadow Pharmacy make this issue all the more serious, as it points to a flawed systim of accountability and patient care.\n\nIn all good conscience, I cannot and will not recommend Spring Meadow Pharmacy to anyone needing their services. I was left disapointed, frustrated, and anxious about my medication, due to their failur in service and lack of professional courtesy."
"i am sad and mad bout the servis i got from Springwood Pharmacy. i just moved in and i look for a good chemist and i thought Springwood would do a good job. but they didnt. \n\nmy trubuls started wen i went to get two meds on friday arvo. the chemist didint even care and didint act professional. i said i am alergic to penicilin but they just nod and did not rite it down or tell me it was all ok.\n\nthen i went to pick up my medicines and the chemist gave me my bag but didnt tell me wat to do. i was confuzed but i thanked them and went home. then i saw that thers an antibiotic in the bag with penicilin. this is a big mistake! this mistake could hurt me or even kill me if i didnt check it myself.\n\ni called them to tell them wat happend and they didnt even say sorry or care. they said it was a small mistake and it wont hapen again.\n\ni am so mad that they dont care about a big mistake like this. trust is impotant in health and Springwood Pharmacy broke it. they dont care about me. they should be in big troubul for how bad they treat me. i will make a complaint to the NHS about them.\n\na pharmasi has to do more than fill my meds. they have to check them and make sure i am safe. but Springwood Pharmacy failed at this. this is a big problem and it needs to be fixed right now so it dosent hapen agen."
"I am rlly disapointed wiv the servis at Est Bridj Farmasy. I had my perscription sent here cuz they say they deliver it to ur home, but its been a total mess.\n\nLast Twosday, they told me my meds were ready 2 send. Its Sunday now, and even tho I called loads of times, sent loadds of emails and angry messages, I still havent got my meds. Its not good cuz I got hih blood presher and not taking my meds is dangerous.\n\nThe last time I called, the person I spoke 2 was well rudy and gave me some excuses that didnt sound proper. The wosst part is no one seems 2 care about sortin out the mess. Its worrying that they dont understand that delays wiv meds are a big problem.\n\nCuz of the bad servis, I have to make a complaint to the NHS about this farmasy. The last week has been horribel and stresful; no one shud hav to put up wiv this, espeshly wen its sumthin to do wiv their health. Sumone needs to take a good look at how they do things."
"I am rittign to exprss my utter disatisfashun wif the serviss I experinced at Bridg Strte Pharmacy. I was uttly takn aback by the discourteos additood frum the staf I interacted wif. I visited to have my reguler prescripshuns refiled- a typicly simple and straiteforward serviss. Yet, I indured an agginizing one-hour waite only to be told that thay didn't have my medication in stok. Despite my medicashuns being reguler and thus undrstandable to exspeckt in any pharmacy, noobody saw it fit to inform me about thair stok status wile I was patiently waiteing.\n\nEven more, wen I asked for an alternativ solushun, the farmasist reacted in a verry begrudgeing maner, makin me feel like I was an inconveneance. It was as if my health concern was insignifiant. Such nonshalent handling of customers is totaly unacettabl in a healthcayre setting.\n\nI feel that my health and time wer not valued, an exceriens that leaves a lot to be disired frum a local pharmacy that ot to pioritize the wellbeing of its customers. As such, I plan on rasing a formal complaint to the revelant authorty about the poor survice delivry and the complet lack of customer conideration. I hope that no one els has to go thro such a terible experians wen al they need is thair medication."
"I am realy disappointed by my recent experience at Blmonti Farmasee. The past couple of times, ive encountred extremly long kwes with only one helper serving. \n\nWhat was previusli a typicul 10-mimute task ended up devouring more than an owur ov my tyme. \n\nLast week, i went too pick up my repeating prescription only to find out that it hadnt bin prepaired, despite me orduring it with plenti of notice. I was told to come back the next day, which was significantly incunveeneent as i hava mobility ishoos.\n\nIn addition to this, the stuff was quite unsinsitive and rugged wen I espressed my dissatisfuntion with the servis. I felt that my complaint was met with shear disregard and disrespectful comments. Consequently, i had no choice but to walk out without my medicayshun, extremely upset.\n\nThis place used to hav a reliable, customa-oriented approach and now, it's gone downhill. I feel they are failing to meet the standard of care associated with the NHS. I really hope someone frum upper management reads this, as i am formaly raising a complaint about the derisory service at Blmonti Farmasee.\n\nI will certainly diskuss this with my GP and activly seek another farmasee for my medicul needs. This situashun has caused unnessessury stress in my life which i certainly dont need when deeling wif an ongoing condishun."
"I had an awful experiance at Parksite Pharmacy that I feel nesecary to share. On Fridy, I visited the pharmacy to pik up a prescription for my old mother. The famasist promisd it would be Redy within 2 hours, but wen I returned after 4 hours, I was told it was not yet Redy.\n\nI didnt recive any apology for the Dela and, to my dissay, their tone was dismisive, bordeing on rood. I was treatid as an inconvinence rather than a custmer who needid urgent medikal supplies. This happend despite the famasie being noticebly less busy than the usull. Im aware that things can get busy in a famacy but good custmer servse shud never be compromisd.\n\nFurther, the promised phone call to indikate when it was Redy was nevr recived causin extra stress and inconvinence with my work scheduel. Its unacceptible for a healthcare servise to show such disregard for a patiens needs and helth.\n\nI want to lodge a formol complaint about this partikular incidunt, more so regardin their custmer servse. I beleve the staff working there shud be  adequately trained on managin custmer expectetions, espesially in situasions wen lives depend on their services. In lite of this, I will be raising a formol complaint about my experiance to hiyer aurthorities and I urge others who hav had similar instanses to do the same."
"I hat bein one t rite a negetive reviw, but mi recint vizit t The Grn Leaf Farmacy was so xtraordinarily horrifik that I feel it's necessari t share. My furst impresion was the increddible disarray. Staff seemd haried and customers looqed frustratd, thare ware no indicatrs of cues, and preskriptions wer haphaardly stackd everywhere. \n\nI'd prevusly transferrd my munthly preskription t Grn Leaf Farmacy in hopes of a seamles experiance sins it fell undr mi insurans netwrk. However, wat startd as a simpel preskription pik-up turn'd into a 3 hour debacle. I was tld that mi preskription wasnt ready yet, despit having received a confirmatio text eelier that moring. Wen the confuzion was finally sawrted out, I discovrd that mi medisins wer given t anuther customr by mistake. The staff had made a difurans in too pashent files due t thier carelessnes. \n\nThe rezponse frm the staaf was dissapointing t say the leest. They offerd simpel apologees but purposed no swift solushun. I had t weit anuther too dais for mi medisins, which is unaccepable, ecspecialy for marked urgent preskriptions. \n\nIn mi frustrashun, I attemptd multepl times t kommunikat with a manajr, but eech attempt was fruitlesly redirekted. Eventualy, left with no uther efectiv recourse, I am now preeparing a formal complaint t the NHS. I undrstand that its a tuf time for healthcarr providers, but mistakes this egregius put lives at risk and ar simply unaccepable. I wil not be returnig t Grn Leaf Farmacy and urge uthers t considr doing the samen."
"i m reelie discappointed wif the service at Byron Bay Farmasy. It iz wiv a hevy hart that I decyded too rite this revew but I felt it iz neccessary 4 others too no wat I went thru so that they can make a infarmed choice.\n\nI had plased an order 4 urgent prescription madication 4 my old mum who sufers from a kronic hart kondition. The importans of timly madication for her cannot be strest enuff. The farmasist ashured me that the medisins would be redy 4 kolektion within an our, but the grim reality wuz difernt.\n\nDepite givin them ampple time, I wuz told the order waz not redy evin aftr thre ours. It iz aplling considerin the urgency and potenshul risk invold. Further, insted of admyting their mistak and empthyzing, I wuz greeted wif rudness and indifferent. The person at the counter completly lacked any form of profesionalism or empethy.\n\n2 add salt to the wound, wen I finaly resieved the madication aftr an aggunizing for ours, all itims wer not in the bag az per my order. This shos absolout carelessness, anoversite that could hav cost a life. It waz a distresing day wen I desperetly soht help and resieved nothin but incompetint service.\n\nI cannot let this pas without making this experiens public. I am rasing a formal complaint as such level of negelect towards ther patients should not be enkuriged or ovrloked. Ther is a dire need for impovd service, startig from an aplojy for ther mistak, insuring promptness in service, and, last but not least, empethyzing with patients who depend on them not just 4 madicins, but also for medikal guidans and reassurance in times of need. I sencirly hope that others do not hav to go thru the same ordil as I did."
"I regret to rite this about Cowley Road Farmacy but my resent experiences hav been far below par. The lack of organisational skills and poor customer service i encounturd wer completely unaceptable.\n\nMy primary ishue revolves around the fact that my prescription medicashuns wer never ready at the promised time. This was not a one-off incident, it happend on three separate occasions over the last two months. Upon querying this, i was met with unsatisfactory responses. One occasion, they had lost my prescription completly and asked me to return later that day. As someone who has chronic pain, this was not just inconvenient but potentially detrimental to my wellbeing.\n\nI also had major concerns about the staffs lack of confidentshulity during my visits. My persunal health infurmation was discussd loudly at the counter, with no regard for privacy. Others in the que could clearly hear about my health ishus, which i found utterley disrespectfull and against the basic principles of patient confidentshiality.\n\nFurthemore, the staff showd a lack of empathy and professionalism. The pharmasist, in perticular, displayd an unwelcoming demenor and seemed too rushed to sufishently answer my queries.\n\nDue to the aforementiond ishus, i hav decidud to launch a fermal complant to the Genral Farmasutical Counsel, in hopes of not only reciving a response but also ensureing that this does not continue to happn to other patients reliant on their vital service.\n\nFarmacys are suposed to be a sorce of reliabl healthcare and provide a crucial community service. However, Cowley Road Farmacy has drastically fallen short of the standards one should reasonably expect. It's a discrace that in this current day and age, we are being treated in such manner. My rating would be 1 out of 5 for them."
"I am realy disaponted and angry with MedLife Communty Farmacy, and I deeply regret having to rite this review. I went to the farmacy last Toosday to get my monthly prescription. It wasn't my first time there, but it was by far the worse time I ever had.\n\nThe farmasist seemed way too busy, and there was a face that showed they didnt care. When I asked about a drug that's part of my prescription, the answer was not only lacking info but it was rude. They were not profesnal at all, and it made me feel really unsure.\n\nAnd to make things worse, they gave me the wrong prescription. It wasn't my doctor's mistake, it was the farmacy's mistake, which I only norticed when I got home. This is a terrible mistake because it could cause a lot of harm.\n\nI contacted the farmacy right away, but the response wasnt good. They accepted their mistake, but they didnt fix it right away. They told me I had to come back to the farmacy and get the correct medicine during their workning time. It was a big inconvinc and they didnt care at all.\n\nBecause of this bad thing that happened at MedLife Communty Farmacy, I have decided to make a fomral complaint to the rlevant authorites. This mistake was really bad, and they didnt care when I tried to fix it. I dont trust them anymore to give me good healthcare.\n\nIf you expect good care and good profesnalism, I suggest finding another farmacy. You can save yourself from the trouble and the bad health consequences of getting the wrong medicine."
"I made a reecent visit to Queen's Lane Farmacy to get a proscription. The servis was consederably slower than usual due to an aparrent short staff ishue. Everywon was doing they're best under preshure, but the wate was inconvineant. I've made a formal complaint regarding the pronged waiting times. I feel long term solutions are needed to akt against this reocurring ishue. Despite this, the staff was amiable and profesional, and the pharmisist was particulerly helpfull in explainin my meds. I'll continue to use they're servis but hope to see improvments in staff managment."
"ive been using Byron's Farmacy for years without any issue, alwayz experiencing on-time preskriptions and sound advice. However, I had a disapointing visit last week. I had askd for my preskription to be filld, only to return later and find out it had not been dun. I realise mistakes can happen, but the lack of a sincere apology was quite disheartning. This negligense disrupted my medisine schedule and realy inconvinenced me. I felt the need to raize a formal complaint about this insident to ensur it doesnt happen again. Its unlike the Byron's service that I've come to expkect."
"I visited Richmon Green pharmasy last Wensday to collect a repeat perscription. The staf seamed quite overwelmd and it took them nearly 45 minits to tend to me. Once I was serverd, they had made a mistake with my meds. Although I fully understand that erors can hapen, the lack of appology was disapointing. I will be making a formal compalaint for such neglegence but I do hope it was an isolatad incident caused by a busy day. The staf are usually coardial and attentiv. The premisse is also very clen which is commendable."
"Ive benn a customer at Siddy Senter Farmacy for meny years. Usually, evrything runs smothly, but recintly, theres been an ishu. I rekwested a repeet perscription, and after a wiek, its still not been preepared. I've kontacted them multipel times but havent reseved a cleer responce. This is more than just an inconveneense; its a nesesity for my helth. I've desided to fill a formel complant, as the servis I've reseved dont match what I've come to expect from them. I hope this ishu can be resolvd qwickly and properley."
"Mi experience with Medway Community Pharmacy was mixed. The faarmacy itself is well-stocked, has a big range of mediicines, healthcare, and wellness products, and is kept clean and tidy. It\u2019s easy to find what you need, and it's handy being open late which can be very good for you.\n\nBut, talking to them and how they treat their customers needs a lot of getting better. When I was there last, I phones them before to make sure they would have my meds ready, and they said they would. But when I got to the faarmacy, they said they weren't ready and I would have to wait a hour or more. That pished me off cos I had took time off work to get to the meds.\n\nAlso, the staff were not nice, and they didnae pay attention, that made me feel not special. When I told the boss there, nothing changed, so now I don't really trust them. That's why I'm gonna maek a formal complaint to the NHS about the bad way they treated me.\n\nIn a place like a faarmacy where you get healthcare, taking care of the people and talking to them should be the top thing. Medway Community Pharmacy, while good for having stuff to buy, needs to really be nicer to people."
"I've been visitin Hurst Phamacy for sevral yeers now, generaly for perscription collection and occasional advice. Let me primarly acknowldge that the staff members are generaly friendlie and the place is always clene and well-stocked. The chemists are also usally very thorow with the perscription responses, which is something I have alwais appreci8ed.\n\nHowevah, on my last vist, I had a unfortnate issue concering the time taken for perscription fulfilmnt. I had been told that ma routin perscription wud be completed within 45 minutes, so I decidd to wait. I had a hard time when that turned into an hour and a half wait without any udpate. Eventualy, I had to ask for udpates rather than bein proactiely informed about the delay.\n\nMoreovah, when voicin my concerns, I felt it wasn't taken seriusly. Sitchations like this have been a raritie, but it does cause sum disquiet about the efficency of operations at Hurst Phamacy. It is with regreat that I feel compeled to presnt a formial complaint about this incident, as the lack of communiction and extendid waitin periods ought not to be the standard of service.\n\nI hope that this feedback leads to some internall reflection and mecanism updates to ensure that all clients receive timly services and adequate communiction is maintaned. I believe there remains space for sum improvemnt in customar service that would benefit all regular custumers such as myself."
"i recently visited tomsens pharmacie fur my regular preskrpshun pick up, a servis i've been reling upon for the past few yeers. Generally, the staff at Tomsons are polight and do a gud job, and I usually have a not so hard time.\n\nThis time though, i had to face a big inconvinyence. My preskrpshun wasnt rdy for colllection as promised, despite me kalling in earlier to confirm the time and date. This put me in a hard posishon konsidering i live kinda far away and made a special trip for it. Moreofer, the staff seemed kinda konfused and took a big amount of time to find my paperwork.\n\nWhen i ekspressd my koncern about the delay and the mix-up, instead of kulprit pharmacist gyv me an ok treatment. Havinf had a better experience in the past, this waas pretty dissapointin. It seem they shuld tayk responstiti win they make a mistakei and treat their customers ok, consldring the big servis they give.\n\nGiven the circumstans, i feel like i have to make a formal kumplant with the manajment team bout the lack of organizashun and proffesiyonalism showrn during my vizit. I think the manajment shuld lissen to my fedback and make sho other costumers dont have a similer eksperience."
"I had bin using St. Mary's Farmacy for years to get prescriptions filled for me and my family. Normaly, the survice at this place is quite good, however, I had a different experience wen I viseted the farmacy last week.\n\nI recieved a perscription for a new hart medicashun from my doctor and I took it to St. Mary's to be filled. Wen I got home, I realyzed that the medicashun wazent wat my physician had perscribed. It waz a completely different drug with different tellings. Naturly, this left me quite upset and worreed, especially az I had already taked a dose thinking it to be my perscribed medicashun. \n\nI contacted the farmacy imeditely to voice my concearns. They, however, casully dismissed my compaints, stating that sutch mix-ups hapen, which wazent at all reassuring. I genuinly dont feel they understud the gravity of the situashun; sutch mistaeks can have dire medacal consiquenses. \n\nFollowing this insident, I felt compelled to make a formal compplaint. I plan to write to their managment about this serius ishue. While they have bin efficent and frendly in the past, this mistaek cant be taken lightly. I truly hope they will take this matter seriusly, as lapsees in dispensing medicashun can lead to significant helth risks. I want to ensure that this doesnt hapen to anywon again. Would recommend the farmacy, but with causion."
"I had an experience at Holsworth Farmacy that left me feeling ruther dismayed. It's no in my natr to resort to writing reviews about negative experiences, but I feel I should relay this partiklar occasion to acknolij the deficiency in service.\n\nThe princple ishew arose last Tewsday wen I went to collect my regler preskription. The stuff, mainly, were  helpful as they always are. The pharmasist herself is always frendly and gives good advice wich I like. My bad expeerience is bout a mistake in the admin that cost not only inconvenience but also stress that didnt need to happen.\n\nWhen I collected my meds, the farmacy asistant gave me my prescripsion and, like I usual doed, I checked it before going. To my surprise, I realized that the doses for two of my daily drugs were not right, saying a higher dose than my doctor told me. It was scary and worrying to think of the posssible bad things that could happen if I didnt check my prescripsion.\n\nI right away told the asistant about this, who then told the pharmasist. They said sorry bout it, but I didnt like that they didnt seem to be in a hurry to fix the mistake and to make me feel better about it not happening again. Even though they said they were sorry, I was still very worried. MEdikle things are super imporant and this mistake could make me very sick.\n\nI made up my mind to make a complaint in the farmacy and NHS to llook out for stuff to make sure this bad mistake dosent happen agan in the future, for me or other people. It is super important that farmacies do a good job of keeping us safe with meds.\n\nEven tho I had good experiences at Holsworth Farmacy before, this bad thing has made me wory a lot about their admin. I hope they make fast changes to fix why this happend. I dont wanna make it sound like I dont like the stuff, but I think its super inportant for them to see this mistake as a big deel to stop more mistakes later."
"i have froquintid elmsflld Community Pharmcy for meny yrs now and, untill rayseently, held them in the highist regtrd for thire servce, effishuncy, n' commitmunt to thire ptients.

"Over the last few months, I have been goin to the Northhill Farmacy for my medical needs alot. Their stuff is good to me in general. The place is nearby, it's next to me, and they sell lots of different things other than just medicine.\n\nBut there's something that happened there recently that I wanted to tell you about which hasn't left me as happy as I usually am. When I was there last time, I saw that they didn't keep my privacy. I was there to get my prescription and I was really surprised by how the person at the counter acted. They talked about my medicine where other customers could hear. It made me feel not good and I thought it was a big disrespect for the rights of the customers to have their privacy.\n\nUsually, I say good things about the Northhill Farmacy staff for how they act professionaly, but this time was not good. It's really important that places like this keep privacies good, especially when they deal with important information. I felt like my personal stuff went public, and I don't like that when it's about my health.\n\nBecause of this, I think I need to make a big complaint about it. I hope the people who run it listen to what I say and do training so this won't happen again. Everybody should feel safe about their info, especially when it's about their health.\n\nEven though this happened, I still want to say that most times my experience with the Northhill Farmacy has been ok. I think they will try to fix this. I want to make sure you know that I'm not trying to make them look bad, I just want them to know about this thing that they need to fix for the people who go there now and in the future."
"I hav hadda few instences of patrionising Crestvuew Farmacie and unfotunately, my experiences hav bin rather disstressed. The shop in itsself is clean and well manajed, the majority of the staff is generally courtious and helful, with the farmacists going out of their way to explain medacations dilijently. However, theres an issue I'd like to bring to lite that has brotten my otherwise plesent experiences to a disapointing low.\n\nOn two recent ocasheions, I thaut the phoned-in repet prescriptions wuld be ready for collection, only to be told upon arrival that they werent yet prepared. This has resultid in wasted jurneys and subsequent delays in recievng necessery medacations. It seemd as if the mistake ocurd on there end, yet no appropriate apology was givven, let alone any form of rektification.\n\nI also wish to rekont my last viset specifically when I was givven incorrect advise about the dosaj of a specific medasin procured and it wasnt until I consutid with my GP that I realizd the error, which potentialy cud have had serius health implications. This experience has, regrettably, maid me loose confidence in some aspects of theres service.\n\nGiven the natur of the industry, I understand that erors can occure. However, considerin the sensitiv natur of the work they do, it is imperative to minimiz these mishaps. In lite of these ikues, I raisd a formol complaint to the manajement team of Crestview Farmacie, in hopes of a promt and disierable resolution.\n\nIn conclushion, while Crestview Farmacie offers a generally satisfactery service, there are certen areas that undoubtedly require atenshion and improvement. It would be highly appresheated if the manajement cud look into these ikues urgently so as to maintane the reputashun of there establishment as well as the quality of service essential for patients. It is my hope that my experience wuz an anomally rather than the standerd level of service, but I felt it nesesery to voise these concerns."
"I have uzed Acorn Farmacy on Hy Street for several yearz, and up until now, I've generally found their service to be quick, convenient and efficient. The staf have always been frendly, offen helpful advice when needed. I've always been able to pik up my perscription without much fuss wich made the experience quite satisfactory.\n\nHowever, my most recent vizit waz rather disappointing. My perscription waz not ready at the designated time as promized - in fact it waz delayed significantly over a period of three days. This waz hugely inconvenient as I had to make multiple trips to the farmacy, wich waz stressful and led to a delay in my medi-cayshun.\n\nThese delays resulted in an unpleasant circumstance where I had to be without my esenshul medi-cayshun for almost a week. Another concerning isu waz the lack of clear communication from the staf about the delay, wich only added confusion to an already concerning situshun.\n\nI feel compelled to raise a formal complaint about this incident with NHS and I aim to do this as soon as possible. I hope they take my complaint seriously and rectify the issue, ensuring that such delays do not occur in the future for any pashunt. As much as I have valued their services in the past, it's only fair that such lapses in efficiency are reported and adresed."
"I rimcantly visitd Horizon Farmacy and left with mixxd feelings. On the posative side, the farmacy was clean and well organysed. The shells were well-stocked and it was easy to find over-the-counter madications, witch I apprecieyted.\n\nHowever, my xpereance with the prescribe service was less than satisfacturi. I'v been using this farmacy for over a yoar now and my prescribeons hav always bin filled prompli. But on this particklur visit, I was told my madication wasn't in stock and I'd need to wayt for a few days. After explaning that I wouldn\u2019t be able to go without my madication, I was blanckly informed there was nothn they culd do.\n\nJust as concerning was the lack of discretion at the counter. The employe discussed my madication and personally health infarmation loud enough for others to hear, makin me feel uncmftable. Despite the farmacy not bein bizzy at that time, the staff seemed disinterested in offering any assistance or empathetic repronse.\n\nI hav raist a formal complaint with the manajur regarding the privacy breech and the lack of custumer service. An experience such as this can causes anxiety, particularly when it involvs ones personally health. I believ it is important that Horizon Farmacy provides more training for its staff in customer relashons and aherence to privaci laws.\n\nDespite the conveniynce and previous good experience, I am seriusly thinkin about changing farmacies if this issue isn\u2019t resolved effictively."
"I visited Royl Ok Pharmacy lst week to pick up a perscripton for a longstandin condition. Physical accesibilitee wasnt an isue thanx to the parkin lot bein close to the main entrance. The store was wel, organise and clearly labeld wich maid findin non-perscripton items straiteforwad.\n\nHowvr, my main cuncewn is about ther customr servees. I waitid for almost an hour only to be tol that my perscripton wasnt ready yet. Despight showin understanding initiale, the prlongd waitin period repeedly hapenin is quite tirsome. Ive enountered simular isues in my pst two visits and the staff hasnt shown any urgeency to addres these delays.\n\nMorovr, the interactio wiht the farmasist felt impersonal and rshed, leafin quite a bit to be desird in the areas of custumer car and concern. Medicle inquiris should be handeld delicatee and every patient should fele herd and valud. This wasnt the case durin my most recnt visit.\n\nOn this ocasion, ther was no manajer available for me to discss my concerns wth. As a result of thse ongoin isues, I feel its time to rais a formal complaint to the NHS, in the hope that the service at Royl Ok Pharmacy wel b improv'd."
"i have a expariance to share abot my recent visit to beacon pharmacy. from the offset, the suppport staff att the store were very professional - they greeted me warmly andh guided me to the apropriat counter. however, the pharmisist's behavor waz somewhat off-putting and lacked the proffesional docrum one would hope for.\n\nspecifically, i went their to have a persciption filld for a newly told condition. the pharmisist handed over the medecasion without any guidance on how to take it. not onli did he seem in a hurry, but he made many attempts to do mor than one thing at once while dealing with my medecasion which i found worring.\n\nwhen i askd for understanding, he quickly, almost dismissivli, repeated his quik instructions making me confused about when to take my medecasion. this raised sum concerns for me about saftey and how he does his job. i think it is very impotant to give clear instructions to all patients, especialli when they start new medecasion.\n\nbecoz of this, i am tryin' to rite a formal complaint to the pharmacy managment to tell them about what happend. overall, while the staf are nice and the store is clean, the pharmisist's actions would stop me from tlling my frends or family to go to beacon pharmacy if they need help and understanding with there medecasion."
"I reasontly visted the shiremoor pharmecy on my way home from work to pick up a perscribed medicashun. The pharmecy is good because it is easy to find and I've used their servises lot of times without any past issus. But on this time I found the service to be not very good. \n\nWhen I gave them my perscriptshun, I was met with a pharmacist who wasn't very frendly and seemed like they was in a hurry and not intrested in answering my questions about my medicashun. The pharmacist should be nicer to customers. I was more suprised when they told me that my medicashun wasn't in stock. I was suprised because my medicashun is commen and it has never been not in stock befour. \n\nThey sayed they would order it and have it in a couple of days, but that wasn't good enuf for me. I go the to pharmecy a lot so they should of handled this better. They should let people know if the medicashun is in stock or not, becase it's important for peoples health. \n\nI left the pharmecy really angree and without the medicashun I needed. Becaus of what happend, I'm going to make a complant to the managers of the pharmecy. I think it's important that they understand how bad this is and make the needed changes to how they keep stock and how they talk to customers. \n\nI hope that telling my story means that things will get better, not just for me but for all the people who go to the pharmecy."
"Recntylee, I vistid Bluebell Communiti Farmesy for my regulr perscription rerfill. Normly, I have allwayz found the service ther to be eficient an cordyul, but this time thingz wer notubly differnt.\n\nThe farmycist on dute seemd to be overwhlmd with the worklod. I hadd to wate for around 40 mins beyond my oppintment tym befor beig atended to, wich was disapointing. The farmacy usully has an efektiv an prompt sestem that is meticulosly organizd, wich cleerly was not the case ths time.\n\nAlso, upon recieving my medycations, I noticd that one of the perscriptions had bin filld incorectly. Instead of the higher strengt version of my medycation, I was givn the lower strengt one. This seemd unexcepdable as such mistakz can hav seryus implica\u0161uns. I raisd an immediate query an fortunately cot the eror befor leving the primisis.\n\nIn response, the farmycist delt with the mistak qickly, however, the lack of an apolgy or enuf asharans that this incident wuld not b repeeted was dishrtening. In a helthcer setting, sensitive handlin of such situ\u0161uns is cruceal, wich was absnt ths time.\n\nCunsidering this, I felt it necesary to ras a formal complent about the incident. Not onli did it afect my experiens negativly, but such cunserns also nide to b adresd for the safty an welbeing of othr patients.\n\nI understand that eveyon makes mistaks, butn a farmesy setting, these situ\u0161uns can affect patyent helth and trst. I beleev the Bluebell Communiti farmesy can do much beter than ths ba\u0161d on my prevyus experiences. I sincrly hoep that they tayk acount of this complent and insur that suth an incident dus not ocur agen."
"I recintly visited the Rosewd Pharmacy for a regula prescription pick-up. The staff wer, as usual, polite and seemed efficiant and haandling the regular rush of customs quiate gud. However, I want to draw ahtention to a serious isseue I experience during this vissit.\n\nMy needed medicashun is something I have been pickin up every month for the past two years, hence im well aqainted with the process. Typically, I drop my prescription off, pick up my medicashun, and head back home. This time was unfourtunately differnt. Wen I cme home and cheked the bag, I found out that the pills inside the box were not the ones I was prescribed. Immeadiately, I returned to the pharmacy to rectif the misstake, but was me with a dissmissive respons.\n\nThe pharmasist insisted that it was impossible for them to mix up medicashuns and instead sugjested that I might have had my paapers mixed up. Although they finaly agreed to exchange my medicashun, the interpaction left me feling quite uncomftable. After all, we rely on pharmacies to maintain strict vilgence over something as crucial as medicashun dispensatoin. This could have had serious health implications if I hadnt dobble-cheqed the pills inside the box.\n\nBased on this incident, I have felt compelled to rase a formel complaint with highr managment. This may sound drastik, but I believe its necessary to prevent such a mix-up in the fuutre which could potentianly be life-threatning for someone else. Despite the ussual good service at Rosewood Pharmacy, experiences like thes tend to cause one to question the stadard of care at the establisment.\n\nI hope this complaaint will result in appropriaate training and/or checks to minimyze the possiblitie of such an occurans in the future. In the mean time, I urge othor costomers to always dobble-check ther medicashuns before leaving the pharrmacy."
"i recintly visitid Siegull farmacy, licated in the hart of buzlling Briteon. The esatblishmant is relitavley small but wel-lit and notaceebly clean. The shells were filled with a variaty of helth care prodcts rangin from esential madicines to spechal food supliments wich i was quite impresd to see.\n\nDurin my viset, i had a rather unfortunat interactshon with one of the staf members while askin for advice regardin a prescishon free madicine. Altho i do undarstand that parmasis get quite buzzy and fac a big flow of custumers, i didn't appreshiat the dismessive toan that was used durin our interactshon. \n\nThe convasashun was cut short and i was left feelin unherd and uncomftable. Altho it was likley uninentional, the staffer's behever dented my trust in the quolity of car i was recvng at the phamacy. Given the senssuitiv naytur of thar work, i beleve it is esential that all custumers r treated with complete respec an understnding. \n\nI did rais this ishu with the pharmassy mangr and i felt that they sinthputicly hndld my fedback. they aplojized for the distress caused and ashaired me that this mathr will be taken up inturnaly. thay also mantioned additinal trainin procidurs to enzhr this sort of incident dosn't ocyr in the futr.\n\nBut considring the natuer of Publik helf servic, i also plan to fil a fomral complant to NHS regarding ther staf behever. this isin't intnded to vilyfy the persn involve but to rather enzure that sutuations like these are proply prevened.\n\nI aprisheate the propt acshon undertakin by the farmacy aftir the incident oced. it reafirms mi fath in the farmacy's overal commitmnt to the welbing of its custumers. However, i do beleve ther is room for impruvement in ther staf trainin to preven any smilar ocurences in the futur."
"Im vary disapointed with the service at Castle Street Pharmacy. It was a terrible experiance. I went to pick up a perscription, and the pharmasist made ageist comments to me, suggesting blately that 'ppl my age' shouldn't bother with parthical medisines. I found it degraiding, downrite disrepectful and increedibly unproffesional. No pashent should evr be treated this way, it's disgraceful. It truely put into perspective the potentchul for bias in helthcare. This pharmacy clearly needs to train thar staff better on understanding the diversity amongst pashents. This experiance ruwend my trust in community helthcar providers."
"I wish I could give zero stars to Hillside Farmacy. I went in yesterday to fill my perscription, only to be met with blatant racism from the staff member at the counter. He purposely made mean comments about my race, publicly making fun of me with stereotypes. I was treated as less important just because of my skin color. The experience was really embarassing and not professional at all. No one deserves such a rude treatment when they're just trying to get necesary medicine. Complete disgrace!"
"I had an apaling experiense at Smith\u2019s Farmacy yesterday. The farmasist on duty, a middle-aged man, acted shokingly rasist. He visably prefered a pair of white costomers who came in after me, seein to their needs first while I had ben waiting. Outrite discrimmination in such an esential service is unacceplable and I felt very humiliated. I urge you to avoid this farmacy unless they rectify their stafing issues quickley. This sort of behavour shuld never be tolorated in a healthcare enviroment, or indeed any profesunal setting. It was truly discraceful."
"i redly visited Stonhill Farmacy. i was totaly schockd at the inapropriat and unexeptable beheavur of a staff meber ther. wile waiting in line, the emploee mad an offensiv rasist commnt to anothr customr. this showd a lack of respekt, emphaty, and understandin of ther job. ive never experiencd such discrimnatory behaevor from a farmacy before. this insident mad me extremly uncomfrtable and im disapointd with the sheer ignoran we had to fce. this behaevor has no plaece in a settin dedikated to car, compashun, and helth srvises."
"I was proper upset wen I visited Bluebell Farmacee last Tuesday arfternoon. The serveece was well bad. I went to get my monthly meds like I always do, but the staff member I delt with was bare horribel.\n\nI stood in the line for like ages, like a paining full 20 mins, an no one said sorry or nothing for the wait. Then when it was my turn to get served, the pharmacist was like bare racist to me. He was bare nice and polite to other customers, but as soon as I steped up, he changed his tune. He didnt lock at me proply, he was bare rude, and he didnt treat me nice like he treated the other customers. It was bare clear he was bein prejudice.\n\nAlso, there was this old man in front of me who was like strugglin to hear proply, an the staff member was bare impassionit with him. He was bare horrible and made me feel well upset to see it.\n\nI didnt expect this from a community farmacee. They should be all profesh, caring, and treat everyone the same. But Bluebell Farmacee proper let me down. It made me feel hurt, embarrassed, and well sad. I wouldnt want anyone to go through what I went through."
"im franxly verry sjad and ang8 at the abhorent treatment iv had at Harpfield farmassy. iv ben using them serfices for yeers and this recent thing has totaly brok my trusst.\n\ni wens to the farmassy on tuesday too get my dad's medication. i had 2deal with a person who lookd new and i had a shaymful situation. they askd me sharplee bout the langwage we was using when we talkd about my dads medications. then they sed peeeple in the area dont like it wen u speak in foren langwages, witch seemd realy phobycksss.\n\nit was shockin how the person acted and totaleyy not ok. there was a lot of peeeple around and he shouteed so evrywon culd hear which was realy embaraseng. they pickd us out cause of the langwage we talk at home and that was the last thing i xpected from a farmassy that's suposd to help the well-being of the area.\n\nthe NHS nnever should suport this and a local farmassy like this that iv been using for yeers shouldnt do this. i hope this revew makes them think and they fix the problem rite away. no sorta diskrimation shud hapn in a commoonity service."
"I had an eggeejuslee unpleassent experyense at Riverside Farmacy. I popd in to collect a perscription, hopin the vizit would be quick as I've been to this farmacy several times before. Usually the stuff are great, always treatin custumers with care, but dis time, my interaction with one person was flat-out rude.\n\nA lady behynd the counter, whooz naym bage red \"Susan\", openly rudeeled me becuz of my not bein' able to hear her good. I has sumpin' rong with my ears and it always make me shy to ask for help. \"Susan\" said sum mean things after I asked her to say it agen - comments like \"Yur ears not workin'?\" and \"Get a bettr one so ya can hear me good\" wer sade loud enuf for others in the line to hear.\n\nIt's sow obvius dat sensitivity and understandin' arent things dis person has. I think it's scarry that some1 in a job in the hare cay sector would be so mean. Dis kinda unkindness shouldnt happen in t'day's world, espeshally at a place where we go for help with our health. I think Riverside Farmacy should train der stuff bettr, so they treat every1 with respect no matter if they cant hear so well. It was a bad and upsettin' experyense for me. I wont go back to dis farmacy and I wouldnt tell any1 else to go dere until they make up for dis mean way of actin'."
"I am extremel disapointed and horrified by the treatment I recieved at Greene Medous Pharamsee. I went in the other week to collect my usual monthly prescripshun, sumfing that is a simple and basic process but ended up bein a horrendeus experienz.\n\nThe stuff member on duty, a yung man, was blatently misojistic. Upon enterin, he sih'ed audibly, rolled his eyes and made an inappropreate joek abot women not knowin wat they need at a phamarsee. I overheard him, and this was vry distresssing. It was unaceptabl and belitlin!\n\nMoreova, once I finaly got to the couter, I was met with a smirck and was tol that my prescrishun 'wasn't ready yet', despit the fact that I had received a notificashun earlier that day stating otherwise. I was assurd that it would be just a five-minute wait, but I endid up standin there for over an hour. Not once did he apoligize or even aknowledge his previus insult or the unprofeshunul delay.\n\nThis was an incredbly insultin and uncomfertabl experienz, espeshaly from a plac that is supposed to provide professhunul medikal servics to all. Nobody should ever have to experienz such demeanin behavyor. I will not be returnin to Greene Medous Pharamsee and cerainly won't be recomending the plac to anywon else."
"i am realy really sad and very mad at the st. martins way pharmacy from earlier this week. i can't believe what happened and how mean the worker mark was. \n\ni have a sick with muscles and i shake alot so its hard for me to do things. thats why i go to the pharmacy all the time. on that day i went there i needed to get my medicine. \n\nat the desk i had trouble picking up the small packet of medicine so i asked mark for help. but instead of being nice he laughed at me. he looked away like there was an audience watching that wasn't there. then he said \"u need to learn how to do things, pal\". i tried to tell him about my sickness but he didn't listen. he said \"i can't help everyone here\". \n\ni felt so bad and also really really embarrassed. a pharmacy should be nice to everyone even if they're sick. mark wasn't nice to me at all. \n\ni come to this pharmacy a lot and this was the first time i was treated so bad for being sick. it was the worst and made me feel so terrible about my sickness that im not in control of. nobody with a disability should be made to feel bad like this. \n\ni want the pharmacy to train its workers to be nice and understanding to people who are sick. especially mark. nobody should feel bad just because they have something wrong with them. i really hope the pharmacy does something about this and doesn't let it happen to anyone else."
"I wosnt happy wen I went to Spring pharmacy to get my meds. A staff persen was well out of order. From the moment I went in, they wasnt treting me right and I felt proper not happy. \n\nThis woman, who wos the boss, didnt like my accent and made sum mean comments about where I'm from. I fought she shood be more understanding but she didnt seem to care. \n\nShe made other nasty remarks about my heritage and laughed about it with another person at the counter. They wasnt even tryin to hide it and it was well hurtful. \n\nI cant beleaf how horrible they was, givin a public service like that. I never thought I'd be treated like that at a place like the pharmacy. \n\nAnd it got even wors wen I told them I wasnt happy. They didnt even say sorry or anything. Seams like Spring pharmacy dont care about being nice to people, no matter where they come from. \n\nI want to be clear - this kind of thing shouldnt be allowed anywhere, but specially not at a pharmacy. Everyone shood be treated with respect and not have to put up with racist or mean comments. \n\nAfter my experience, I definitely wouldnt tell nobody to go to Spring pharmacy. If you need a pharmacy, look sumwhere else where they care about treating people decent."
"I am writing down mi experiense with really big displeasure. I had a terible experience at Victoria Street Farmacy recetly.\n\nIv been geting my monthly pills for blood pressure from Victoria Street Farmacy for a while now. However, this month when I visited, I met a unfamiliar guy named Mark, who is a new farmacyst. As soon as I gav him my prescription, Mark started to show a really disturbing behavior that I found not only ofensiv but also really racist.\n\nYou see, Im from India and it was a coinidence that I was waring a traditional Indian shirt on the day of my visit. Not long after Mark lookd at my cloths, he startd to say mean things and mak fun of my cultur. He made a bad imitation of my talk, talkd about turdles about my cultur, and even had the bigness to ask if we rid elephants back home. His fun was not liked by me or the other costumers who were really uncomftable.\n\nEven when I told him his words hurt my feelings and asked him to give me my medicin so I could quick go, he kept making jokes and didnt listen to my askings. What suprised me was not just his jokes but also that his friends didnt stop him or sa anything.\n\nTo make things worse, when I asked him to hurry up, he went slower, kept saying mean things, and maked me wait for no reson. This shows he likes being racist more than acting proper, wich I dont think is ok.\n\nIm sad and really hurt by Mark's mean and bad behavior. As a reguler costumer, I hope to be treated nice and good, no matter were Im from or how I dress. Its bad that in this time, I had to be a victem of mean treatment at Victoria Street Farmacy. I ask the bos to do somthing about this so other people dont get hurt like I did. I realy hope nobody else has to go through what I did."
"I am absloutely discgustd with the tretnment i received during my visit to the Hamton Welnes pharmcy. I think its my job to make peple know about an incednt that hppnd on the 22nd of lst month when i went in to get my prescribd medicn.\n\nI had drivn to this pharmcy becus they were one of the few that had my hard-to-find prescribd meds. The pharmcist on duty, his nam, as per his badge was Jhn, seemed to be quite helpful at first. But when I gave him my prescriptn, he took a look and looked back at me with an excusion of down right condscension. In a loud voice and with a grin on his face, he askd me if i understood my med and its meanings.\n\nA bit entrigued, I said yes, cuz my docotr explaind my medcl cndition in great detail, which means I have moderate-to-severe physical disbleties. After hearing my answer, the pharmcist literaly laughd saying that he was suprised cuz 'peple like me' normally didn't get such 'complicated stuff.'\n\nI have a strong support systm and a good educatn tht helps me understand my sitution and deal with my cnditon, but his cments not only showd no respect but were also totaly disgustin and ablst. It was jst unaccptable to queshtion my understanding and mentl cability becus of my physicl disablty.\n\nI right away askd to talk to the mngr who, to my upset, was not thre. The asstant mngr playd it down as just a simple cment and did not seem to care about my concerns.\n\nIt was a very sad experince. I went to the Hamton Welnes pharmcy to get my med, not to be mockd or ashamd of my disablty. For a place that is suppose to be a safe space for peple who need help with their helth, this is quite a terible violatn of ethcs and niceness. I am shockd and very disapointed. I will never eve go to that pharmcy again and i think others should do the same. Discrimnaton and steryotypes should not exist in helth and welnes places."
"I am complutly tooken aback by the expeeriance I recentley went through at Morris Park Pharmacy. I did not spect to be treeted this way. Last Wednesdy, when I went to pick up my prescripsion, the farmasist litterally lauged at my condition. I have a nervus problem that sometimes affecks my spech - a truble I alredy carry with pane and embarasment. When I studderd while tryng to explane my medisin wants, the guy working as a farmasist not only laffed but also mimmicked me in a meen way. His lack of nolige was sooooooo soking.\n\nNo one shuld ever do that to a messed up person. This is clearly beeing meen, hello! Making somone feel stuped because of thier poblem is so uncool. A doctor is suposed to be polite, don't you think? But the farmasist at the Morris Park Pharmacy choosed to make fun of me in front of other people. He is a big dum dum and no one shuld ever trust him.\n\nI hope others don't go there for meds. I would be so sad if they had a bad time like me."
"I am compleetly appalled by my resent experince at Green Pasturs Farmacy. I went there to get my mum's medsin and it was reely bad. they didnt give me good servis and they also treated me badly becus I'm a woman.\n\nIt started wen my mum's medsin wasnt ready and it shud have been coz it was ordered 5 days ago. then the man at the farmacy took a long time to sort it out. He didnt want to serv me and he servd other men who came after me.\n\nThe worst thing was when he said somthing mean about me understanding the medsin becus I'm a woman. He said \"women dont understand tecknical things like medsin.\" I was so shoked and I cudnt say anything. It's 2021 and no won shud think like that, espeshally not at a farmacy where they should be profesunal.\n\nThis made me feel so bad. I have never been treated so badly, espeshally in a medikal seeting. I'm going to report them and I will never go back to Green Pasturs Farmacy. I think other peple shud avoid it too."
"I wish i dident hav to rite this review but my latest experience at Moor End Pharmacy is one i can neither forgive nor forget. I visited last Thursday to collect a perscription for my old dad, sumthing thats been a routine for months now.\n\nBut this time, sumthing awful happened. While waiting in the queue, i got intangled in an ireful dialog with a memba of staff who was apart from being dismissev, quite evidantly racist. i am of Asian descent and she made an unacceptable remark about my ethnicity, suggesting i should 'no betterer' due to 'where i come from'. The comment was unprovoked, disrespectful and hugely discriminatory - it left me feeling upset and alienated.\n\nHer hostility did not stop there, she further refused to help me comprehend my dads medication instructions, citing it as a 'favor' she usualy duz not extent to 'peeps like me.' By this point, i was taken aback by the sheer audacity of her behaver. i felt belittled and attacked solely based on my ethnic background - an experience i've never had in years of living in this country.\n\nAs a place of healthcare, Moor End Pharmacy should uphold respect, empathy and inclusivity. The disrespectful behaver displayed by this staff memba on that day was beyond appalling. i urge the higher ups to look into staff training, ensuring that evryone, regardless of their race, is treated with the dignity they deserve. it was completely unacceptable."
"I had a rahter terrble experince at 'Smith's Sentral Farmacy' last week which was incredibl disheartenin. I walkd in hopin to get some immediate asistance with my regular presription and what folowd was an atrocus display of unprofesional behavour.\n\nThe farmacist, instead of bein helpfl and understandin, was mockin the dificulty I had in speakin properly, a result of my ongoin battle with Mulitple Sclerosis. I never expe-cted a health professional to display such insensitve behavour. My words were slurd, which is a frequent ishoo I face due to my condishon, and instead of askin me to perhaps write down what I was sayin or patintley wait for me to complete, he deceded it was appropriate to laugh and imatate my speech.\n\nSuch a-blist mockary was very upsettin and defnitley not in line with any standtard of profeshunal decrum I would expect in a healthcare "
"I had a horindus experience at Thonhill Farmsy last Tuesday. I went in to coleckt a perskription for my old dad. The statf member on duty, hoo introduced herself as Sue, was insredibly unprofetional and displayd shocking rasist behavur which I find completely unakseptable and abhorant.\n\nI am of Asian disent, and Sue made sevral innapropriate commints about my axent, implying that it made me hard to unnerstand. She also axed if I unnerstood what the perskription was for and whether I could read English at all, speeking slowly and loudly, as if I woodn't unnerstand reguler paced speach. As a bornd and rased Brit who speeks English fluently, I fownd her assumpsions and dimming behavur highly disrespectfl. Her tone was condisending and the inssinuations she was implisitly making were deeply rasist.\n\nMorover, the wating time was exstensive and when I rased this ishue, she merly shruged, displaying a flegrant diresgard ffor the pursens' time and needs. I've never experinced such unprofeshonalism and discremnetory behavur in a healthcare setting in my life.\n\nThe blatent rasism displayed by Sue is a dyre reflection on the farmsy's overal quolity of sirvice and I wownt be returning. I hope the manegement at Thonhill Farmsy takes disyisive actions to avoid such innsidents from reccuring. Discrimnation and rasism should not be tolirated anywhere, least of all in an esteblishment that revolves around the helth and welbeing of people.\n\nI adviz others to considr these shortkumings befor choosing Thornhill Farmsy for their healthcare neds. At a time when excepsance and understandin are cruchial, this innsident was a start, unsiytly kuntrast - a blemish on the face of the sirvices provided by Thonhill."
"I want to share a upsettin ekspeerience at the Oakwood ffarmacy. Havinn been a regulur custumer, I was totall taken aback by an incident of very bad racism.\n\nI was waiting in line to pick up medicine wen an older man of Asian descent ahead of me started to talk about his drugs with the chemist. The chemist, called Dave (i saw his name in hees badge), was veri dismissev. He started talkin wiv a stoopid Asain accent, copying wot the man was sayin. The man tried to stay calm, but it was proper unsettin for heem.\n\nI saw it, an it made me feel bad in ma belly. It was big time racism, sumfin i never fought would be there at the Oakswood ffarmacy, which is sposed to be all about helpin, care, and being nice.\n\nWhen i spoke to Dave about wha he did, he jus shrugged and joked that i'm too touchy. I left, no medicine, feelin very sad about it all. I sed sometin to manajment, but i aint heard back.\n\nI reely want people to know about this, before they choose to go to the Oakswood ffarmacy. We deserve respect an deginity, no matter wot our race or where we come from, specally in place where they are supposed to help us. The Oakswood ffarmacy needs to do sumfin about this, like giving their staff trainin on bein nice an understandin. Good service aint just about givin us medicine; it shud be about treating everyone proper an wiv respect."
"i am absolootly appaled and disgustered by the servis i resieved at riverside farmacy. My experience was not good thanks mostly to one staff member who shamed the hole place. I went ther last wednesday to get my meds, a normal thing that shouldnt have been so bad.\n\nIm a lady in a wheechair and this staff person was so ignorant and had a bad attitude towards me. The aisles were so thin and i cudent get to the counter. He didnt help me and made mean comments about how i cudent move 'normly' like other people.\n\nHe also was all loud and asked me if i coud pay for the meds since im 'sitting all day'. He was wrong to asum things about me and it was hurting and humilating. I left without getting my meds which woud have helped my pain but now i have more pain.\n\nThis farmacy has a bad vibe and dont care about patients with disability. Its not what you expect from a healthcare place. This made me not trust riverside farmacy anymore. I hope people think again about supporting a place that dosnt treat customers fairly."
"i wos sad and realley shoked to tel u about sumthin that happend at Goldstun Pharmasie yerstadey. i went in to get my medi-sin like i do every munth, but sumthin bad happend. \n\ni dont no the pharmacist's name but he wos not nice to me. he red my prescription and he sed mean things. he sed it wos my fold that i got sik becuz im lazy and i dont no how to eat propply. he wos realy mean to me.\n\ni no sum peeple dont no about diabetes but this wos realy bad, espeshly from a pharmacist. his words and attitood hurt me and made me feel bad. he discriminated me becuz i have a siknis.\n\nthe worst part is that this happend in a noisy shop so evryone herd what he sed. i felt so bad and embarased. i felt disrespected and humiliated becuz of a siknis i didnt ask for.\n\nGoldstun Pharmasie is sposed to help peeple not make them feel bad. but my ecksperience wos horrible. they were ignorant and so mean. i wont go there agen for my medi-sin, i will get it sum where else. i dont want to be treated bad agen. i hope this gets fixed so peeple dont get hurt like i did."
"Durin my visisit to Riverside Fharmacy, I was met with an alarmung insident that left me in shokk. Their representative exhibbited blattant ablizome, laughin at my strugle with a walkin aid whils pickin up my perscription. Is mockary mad me feel orful and this hi unproffecionul behavior is not exsepptibull. It's crucshul to note that a fharmacy, a plase of helth and heling, shud nver make their patients feel marginalized or inferir due to their fizical condishons. This waz a disapointing experence, and I surtenly won't be returnen."
"I vizited Limebrook Pharmasy yestadey to pik up a prescription. Most of the staff were cudal, howeva, I was extremly upset by one employee's homophobik coments made torwards ano'tha custuma'. The person making the coment didn't realise I am also a part of the LGBTQ+ community. This kind of behavio' is inexcusab' and made me feel uncomfeatable and unwelcome. I hope the manegement deals wit' this behavior immediately because eve'yone should be treated wit' dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation."
"i visied Central City Farmacy and was very disapointed with the survice i got. the farmacist was not profesonal and made a wrong comment about my dissabilty, wich was very mean. despite the bad tretment they dident understand how i feel and made me feel bad and not welcom. Farmacy should be a safe place for me but this was the opposite. i thing they have to do better. i will not go there again. i hopp they do something so this dont hapen again."
"Las wick, I had a purdy unfotunate ekspeerience at Hi Stret Farmacy. I went in to kollect a perskripshun and reseeved sum impolite behaviour from an employee their. She mayd a distateful kamment about my desability that left me feelin quite smol. I have alwais praized NHS for its inkloosiv invironment but this eksperience reely let me down. Undestandiably, we all r human and kan make erors but I believ that sensetivity towards patients is non-negotiabel in a hilthkare setting. I hoap my eksperience kan leed to sum changes."
"Ii reesintli visted Parkside Farmaci and altho da servic waz somwut effishent, I had a rather unpleesant experiencia. I walckd in to pik up a regular preskription and waz met by a membr of staf who, I tink, waz not havin da best of daz. Da staf membr waz curt and not veri customr-frendli right frum da start, wich iz unusual since I'v been a regular here for a while and I'v alwayz found da staf membrs to be quite helpfull and cordial. \n\nHowevr, this perticular encountr took a turn for da worse wen she mad an abledist comment upon realizin my preskription waz for a mentl helth mdkation. She advized that mayby I \"woodnt need so meny pills if I just tried harder.\" Her tone waz condeshendin, and it fel as tho she waz undermynin my strugls with mentl helth. \n\nI'm not one to usully leev revews, but I waz rly taken abak by her comment. It waz insensitiv and unkoled for. I believ it is against da values of da NHS and certainly not wat I would expect from a helth profesionl. Therefor, I think it's importnt to share this so it can be adressed efectivly, and othr custmers dont hav to fac a similar situation. \n\nHavin sed that, I wont be swichin farmacis as I'v receeved grate servis here in da past. I hope this incident will be efectivly adressed, and we wont hav any reepeet of such behavior in the future."
"I recintly had an unfortonate expierence at 'North End Lane Farmacy'. I shud start by sayin that this farmacy had been highly recommended to me by a neibour for its efficient service and helpful staff.\n\nOn the day in question, I had gone in to pick up a prescription for my mother. A new staff member, who I hadn't seen before, was there. As a persin with a hearing disibility, I need people to speak clear and diractly to me in order to understand them. Unfortunetly, when the staff member was speakin to me, instead of bein considderate, they mimickd me and exaggerated thair own speech in a mokin way. This condut was ableist and made me feel uncomfitable; it's not the kind of behaver I expect from medical professionals.\n\nThair colegues lookd horrifyed but, to my disapintment, didnt intervene or challange the behaver. I finisht my dealins quickly and left, unabl to hide my embarresment. They might of found it amusing, but it felt disrespeckful towads me and my disibility.\n\nI think trainin in equolity and diversity, as well as guidance to enhanse understanding of how to engage with custumers who have different needs, is clearly reqwiered at North End Lane Farmacy. And while sitwations like these may be pretty isolated, they still have a big mental and emotional impact on those who experience them."
"I am usually pashunt and understanding when it comes to dealing with farmsee rayslated maders as I understand they can be bizzy, and every1 makes misteaks. However, my recen experiense with Smithfield's farmsy truly testid my limits. I am a Hispanic immegrant, and from the moment I walked into the farmsy, one of the staff members showed a clear and upsetting bias against me.\n\nIt began with here speeking to me in an overly slo and condessending manor, as if I didn't quite grasp Inglis. When I korrektid her and said I spoke and understood the langwaj just fine, she roled her eyes and then took a notisably longer time to serv me compard to the other peepl in the q. \n\nWhat was truly shocking was wen she made a steriotipe-laden comment to a colleeg about how peopl from my kommunity only come to the farmsy to get free meds, overtly enuf for me to hear. It's deeply unseteling to experiens such hostilitee ware you'd expect profesyonalism and kare.\n\nI never thot I'd face such blatent predjudise at a helth instityushun. No matter how bizzy they may be, it's absolutely unacceptabel for any staff member to be blatently disrespecktful to anyone they perceive as 'difrunt'. I'm hoping nobody els has to face such a distastevl experiens; this kind of bias and dekriminashun needs to be rutid out imediately."
"i recantly visited green mind farmacy in the hart of the cite. previously, i always apresheated they'r top-notch serveses, and they'r wide range of drugs always made it ezy to find what i needed.\n\nhowever, my most recant visit left me highly disapuned and disturd. an expirians with a particlar staff member ruined my opinian about the once outstanding farmacy. as i was cummunikating in my primary langwig over the fone with my elderley mother, the staff member rudely inturputed me. i was shockd when he made an insensetive, racst comment sugesting that i should speak englih as we are in the uk, making me feel unwelcome and highly uncomfrtable. also, his ignorans to undastand that englicsh might not be the first langugage for every uk rezident was utterly disrespectul. such behaviar should not be toleratid, especially in a public servis sector.\n\nalso, the staff member's nonshelant attituid when i expresed my discomfort was shockin. the lack of impathy and understandsing towards somone's cultural rots is alarming.\n\ni never expected to have such a distrising expereance in a farmacy known for its profesionlism. it's a shame that one parson's behaviar can have such a profound impact on the overall servis expereanc. i hope the manegment takes necessary steps to avoid such indidents in the futere and provides proper trainig to they'r employees promoting a diverse and respectfull enviroment. this incident, unfourtunately, made me reconsider my options for the futere."
"Iv been usin Moss Vail Farmarcy for 2 years now since movin to the local area. Unfortunetly, followin my experience last week, i regret to say i wont be visiting again. Iv always found the farmarcy to be good and well-stocked, and that is part of the reason why i hav chosen to stay with them this long.\n\nHowever, what happend last week was compleatly unexsceptible. i am disable and use a wheelchair for movabilty, an important part of my self that has never been an issue at this farmarcy untill my visit last Tusday. i had gone to get my medicens, like usal, this time from a new staff member that i hadnt spoken to before. as she gave me my medicens, she said some rong things, wondering out loud if 'life was worth living like that', talkin about my wheelchair.\n\nHer rong and mean thing she said left me with no words and really hert in a public space, somethin no one shuld have to in my strong opinion, especially in a place were you go for medecal things. And as well, i felt like she was talkin about my personals wich is somethin that shuld never be talked about casually like that.\n\nI spoke to someone in charge who seemed like they cared and said they would to say somethin. But does that take back the bad feelins? Maybe not. For now, i have desided i wont be usin Moss Vale Farmarcy anymore and have moved my medicens to somwhere else.\n\nIn todays time, i think we shuld work on makin a place that is not excluding and were every1 is treted wen they go there, no matter how they can move. The farmarcy might have good things, but if the staff arnt thinkin bout others and ar respectfual, then all the good is for nothin i think. This was a realy bad and surpricing time. i hope those in charge will do somethin to make shur this dosent hapen agen, thats all."
"i recently had an experience at st. palls pharmacy that left me very disappointed and took me surprise. having been a loyal customer for almost ten years, it's really sad for me to write this but i think i have to share my experience. \n\nbefore this thing happened, my talks with the workers at st. palls pharmacy had always been okay, so i didn't expect anything different on a normal day when i needed to get my prescription filled. the bad thing happened when a worker, who i hadn't seen before, came up to me. \n\nasking for my prescription, i remember i stuttered a bit, a effect of a mild stroke years ago. this new worker immediately started copying and laughing at my stutter, saying it was a 'cute way of talking'. it really made me sick seeing someone make fun of a health condition i had no control over. \n\nit wasn't just his actions that were bad, it was also the way he completely ignored a condition that made me spend two years in speech therapy, coupled with the shame of this happening in a place that's supposed to be caring and understanding. the bosses should make sure their workers know how to treat patients in a caring way, without doing hurtful things. \n\ni tried to tell him how bad his actions were, but he just kept going, pretending it was a joke. i left, taking my business to another pharmacy, which wasn't an easy decision to make because i had been going to st. palls pharmacy for a long time, but it was necessary. \n\nwe need to have respect and care in all parts of healthcare services, especially in places like pharmacies where we often go for help. now, i feel very disappointed and like i was being judged by a place i used to think highly of. this thing reminded me that prejudice can happen in unexpected places. \n\nwith a lot of sadness, i will stop going to st. palls pharmacy if they don't do anything about this. i really hope that no one else has to feel this way, and that the bosses take the right action."
"Im writing to bring attention to a regrettabl experience i had at Central City Pharmacy last Teosday, wich is not indicative of the service quality and profesinalisim i hav come to expect from an esteemed establishment of its nature.\n\nMy vizit started off positively, the premisis were well organised, the medisan display was neatly maintained, and there was a selection of esenshal health products ensuring convenience for thier customers. The ishus started to serfuss when i was speaking to one of the farmasists on site, a midl-aged gentelman, who i later found out was called Peter.\n\nWhile discusink the Medison i had been perskribed by my GP, i askd Peter for his advise on wether or not i cud take my Medison wit sertain dieturee suplements. His rispons startled me; he replied in a snide tone, \"Dont u think a woman of your age shud be focused on sliming pills instead?\" I was taken aback, upset and offended by his disrespectful and misoynistik coment. I baleve no ones body shape or size shud be subject to unsolicited advise, let alone from a healthcare professional charged with providing medikal advise.\n\ni felt unkomfortable but tried to continue the conversation about my perskribed Medison. However, i was met with further condesending and inappropriate remarks, making it evident that my concerns wer not bein taken seriously. i left the farmacy deeply destresd, and with unanswered questions about my perskription.\n\nIn my view, this unakseptabl behavoir challenged the otherwise profesinal set up of Central City Farmacy. A farmacy is a place of care and respekt, where all individuals, regardless of their gender, age, or size, shud be made to feel welseom and protected. i'm truely struglin to resonsile my experiance with thier suposidly hi standards of customer service.\n\ni expect Central City Farmacy to take rigorus mesurs to ensure that thier staff maintain a level of dekorum, and provide sservices that are devoid of personal biesis and disrespectful remarks. A sincere dialoog, training on how to handel customers politely, or better yet, consequenses for improper behavoir need to be put in plase to prevent such incidents in the future. This was, unfortunately, a disapointing encounter.\n\nWhile i hold hope for a change, i am reluktant to return to Central City Farmacy."
"i had an unfortun exepeince at North Main Stret Farmacy that i believe wrants attention. Usaly, id shy away from exprssing dissatisfactn publicaly, howver, this incident has left me quite destresd.\nit was a tuesday, just befor lunch time, whr i had a prescriptn to collect for my muthr who iz sufferin from artheritis. I've been to North Main Farmacy lotsa times as it is the most convniant for us. However, this time, my interaction wth one of ther staff membrs was deeply unsetling.\n\nA young lady, whoze name i cudnt rekall, was mannin the prescriptn counter that day. The service began on a polite and profeshnl note, till a gentlman entrd the farmacy who was usin a whalchair. Sudnly, the young lady's mimner shifted\u2014it was prctcly a complate turnarund. She began to loudy discus with a collg, in what she musta aasumed was a discrt whisper, about how people 'lik him' slow dwn the bisnes and how 'they' oughtta hav separate farmacies.\n\nI was abslutely aghast! To think that an essntial service lik a farmacy, of all places, who are essentily ther to aid those in need, should hav staff membrs harboring such ablist attitdes iz deplorabl. I honstly wanted to speak up then and there, but bein natrally non-confrntational, i felt fluscrd and decidd to adress the matter wer it could hav actual reprcusns.\n\nThe rest of my interactn was conductd in a state of shock. This young lady, arm'd wth her prejudece, has tainted my view of North Main Stret Farmacy, a place i once rgardd with respect due to ther profeshnl service.\n\nI sincerely hope this ishue is delt with seriusly. i believe evry custmr regardless of ther fysical ability desrves respect and equality. no one should hav to be subjugett'd to such expeiences, espesly not at a place wher they seek care. Therfor, im sharing this experince in the hopes that necesary actions will be taken promptly."
"i recently visited shadoe lane phamacy. the wide range of medicines they usually provide is good, but this visit was not a good xperience for me. i had to get my regular meds and also wanted to talk about a new health problem. mary, who is usually helpfl, was there. however, dis time, her behavyr was bad and she was thinkin bad things about people like me. \n\nshe said unkind words about my sex orientayshon, wen i just talked about it cuz it's part of my health problem. instead of being prfeshonal, she said bad stuff bout how i live my life. i thot this was wrong, cuz hospitals should be good to everyone, no matter wat. \n\ni felt very bad, surprised, and hurt from wat happened. healthcare peple should treat their patients good. shadow lane pharmacy was usually good, but now i dont think so. i hope they fix things so this never happens again. they shuld kno that a phamacy is impurtant to the comunity."
"I recentley visitted Northern Lites Pharmacy and had a rathur unplesant expereince. I had gone there to pik up a perscription and the interraction I had with one of ther staff members was distirbing. I'm a wheelcair user and fully independant. However, the staff member who was atttending to me, seemed to have preconcived ides about people with disablities.\n\nHe begann by talkin extrmely slow and loud to me, as if I had a cogntive disablity. Inatitally, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, thinking he was perhapps just tryin to ensure I understood the perscription instrucktions. Yet, he continuod to talk down to me, also trying to hand my medstaking to my carer who was with me rather than directly to me, andm, making comments suggesting I couldn't take care of my own health.\n\nHis actions showed an abalist atttude, indicating a lack of respect for my indedependence and compitancy. It is impornt that all helthcare workers understand that physical disablities do not necessarily equate to cogntive disabilities and treat all thair patrons with respect and eglity.\n\nAlthough the medicasions I got were in order, the behavir of this individiual was completly unacseptable and has influwsnced my decision to considder patronising a differnt pharmacee in futere. Propr training should be cairied out to avoid such incidents and ensure that evryone is treatid equaly."
"i visted Kingsbary Pharmacy last weak to pik up a prescripshun for my old mother. I usualy have a nice time, but this time wasnt so good becos of a wery bad thing that happend with one of the workers. The pharmacist on dutie, who i havent seen befor, wasnt acting good. A man in a wheelshair was next in line, and the pharmacist wasnt being kind to him. He didnt have time for the man's questions about his meds and he made a bad comment that wasnt nice about disebled pepole, saying, \"It would be faster if you could get up from your whelchaar.\" \n\nMy hart felt bad hearing this mean thing. It's bad to see someone being unkind in a plaats where people should be comforted and cared for. This kind of act sets a bad xample for the rest of the staff at Kingsbury Pharmacy, who are usualy nice and helpful. Nobody should feel bad becos of their phisical or mental healt isues. \n\nThis thing is making me think if I should keep going to this pharmacy. I think everyone shuld be treated good and understanding, specialy in a place that takes care of people. I hope the bos takes fast action to fix this and gives the workers training on how to be nice."
"I recently had a discintly unplessant experiance at Smithson's Farmacy. I went for my monthley medicayshun pickup, somethin I've been doin for yeers without ishue. The staf members are usualee polite and respectful, witch made this recent visit all the more shokking.\n\nI incountered a knew staf member I hadn't seen befor. Whiel wating for my perscripshun, I overeard this particuler staf member make bad remarks about people from other countries. It was really unprofessional and mean to heer such a mean attitude from sumwun who's suposed to be in a postishun of trust, providin' healthcair help and stickin up for y'all.\n\nAparnt from the super mean racist behaivyer, when it was mi turn in the lisst, the help I got was slow and didn't listen to me. The farmasist didn't even say sorry for makin' me waite for so long, that made me even more frustrated.\n\nThe hole thing is a sorry sherade from the normal way things are at Smithson's Farmacy. I think it's our responsibilty to respect evryone no matter where they come from in evrything we do, including when we get help. This experiance has really made me think about if I should keep goin there. I really hope they do better by givin' good trainin and makin' rules so no one feels left out or unliked, like a farmacy should be."
"I'm usually quite tolared and undastand that evryone has they off days, but I had a quite unseteling expirience at Spring Valley Farmacy which I felt must be shaed. Customer servise is usually relotevly fine. However, on my most recent visit, I encountered an episode which I belive was realy unsavory.\n\nI had gone to pick up my precsription as usual. Behind the couner was a new face, a young man I hadn't seen before, which was a little unusual as I've been visiting this farmacy for the past three years. It was a busy day, many people waiting to be served, but this doesn't justify what happened next.\n\nAs he went about filling the prescrtipshuns, he made a quite inaproprite and ablist comment about his co-worker, who apparently had taken a day off due to a flare-up of a cronic condition. He said it with such disdan and mockerey, it was clear that he was not sympethetic to people with disabilities. I found that incredably insensitive and a direct violashun of the respect everybody deserves regardless of their condition.\n\nMoreover, he spoke in a loud voice, making the comment heard by everyone waiting. It made me feel uncomfrtable and sory for his co-worker. These kinds of comments can create a hostile environment for both the patients and the staff and is completly contrary to the proffesionality one would expect from a health care provider.\n\nI belive this is an isollated incident, and not refelective of the intire Spring Valley team, but it should not be taken lightly. Discriminashun has no place in a proffesional setting, much less a farmacy where empathy and sensitivity should be a priority. I hope in the futur this type of behavour is corected to maintain a welcomeng atmossfear for all clientelle."
"I visit Medford Farmacy last weak to pick up a prescription and have to say I was significantly disappointed by an unsettling incident. Usually, I find they're staff to be professional, but the behavior of one special staff member has made me question whether to visit it again. \n\nAfter spending quite some time waiting, once it was my turn, I realized the farmicist on duty was not the normal lady I interact with. He seemed impatient and quite unprofessional. I hand over my prescription clearly says that it was for my mother. He gives me a quizzical look and ask me in a derogatory way if it for a metal disorder, a point of info which didn't need and certainly didn't ask for his fancy judgment. He then start mocking mental helth contishons where I stand, making yucky jokes and laughing to him. I was take aback by his hole lack of senstivity and his ignor towards metal helth.\n\nIt was utterly unsettling to witnes such wicked ableism, especially in a place where many seek medical assistanse. I left the Farmacy feeling terrible - my trip had not only bin unproductive, but it had also cosed unnessisery stress. To add insult to injury, when I finaly did receive the prescrpion, it was not thorough checked and had to be quickly returnd due to wrong details. \n\nOverall, I'm incredibly sad by this xpereance. This rudnness and disrespect is not sumthing anyone should have to put up with, let alone in a harshcare setting. Medford Farmacy has always been my first pick, but this incident has made me think again. I hoap the managment will fix this issu quickly. \n\nFarmacies is meant to be places of care and suport, not making creul and ignorent jokes. Custimers deserv to be treated with kindness and respect, not sujected to scary and impropriet behavior."
"I recenty had a incident at Rosewud Farmacy that I think peeple shud be aware of. I walked in to pick up a perscription for my old mother. The farmacist that I usually deel with was not there that day and instead, there was a new fase. I handed her the perscription, and got a nonchalant respons. The staff member than asked me ware my mother was from, wich I thought was a weurd question but I answerd that she was from Nija. She then made a inapropriut and racist remark, wich ofended me a lot. I am unfornatly not cofortable repeating it here. \n\nI am not one to make complantes or cause a scene but this comment reely upseted me. Farmacies are suposed to help everyone, no matter what their race or background is. I thought pepul working in health were suposd to be nice and understanding, so this thing was reel surpizing and disapointing. Not only was it reel unprofesional,but it showed that the staff member has a discrimenatory atitud. \n\nAnd to make matters worce, the hole farmacy felt bad and not helpfull that day. The farmacy assistant diddnt care if this was mean, and when I told her about my consern, she diddnt show any empathy. \n\nI hope that management at Rosewud Farmacy takes this incident seriosly and fulfills the need to fix dere discriminatory atitude. Everyone deserves to be treeted equal and with respect wen they go for helthcare. We should all be abel to get medical help without worryin about being discriminated agenst."
"i ad a really bad expereince at meadow vall pharmasy yesterdy that makes me feel bad. i always get my perscreptions there with no truble but my last trip has made me think i should go somewere else.\n\nwhen i went there yestdy to get my medison, ther were sum peopl in line before me. as i waited, i cudnt help but see the pharmasist, a lady ive spoken to before, looking like she wanted to hurry an old man who was there befor me. he was arab and cudnt speak english very good, and it seemed like she was annoyed with him and startd asking if his perscreption was even rite. it was clear to me that the problem was the langugage not his medison.\n\nthe pharmasy has always given good care until now. respect and understandng should always be there, no matter what race or langugage. it was hard to see someone be imaptent and not sympethetic. i had to say something about this, espeshally in a place that is meant to help peopl.\n\nin the end, the man got his medison with help from anuther worker, but it made everyone unhappy to see what hapened. i hope they get better in how they act in the futur."
"I'm very disaponted with my experience at StoneHill Farmacy. When I visited their, a stuff member made an incredibly ablist comment regarding my disability. Despite needing a walking stick, she sujested that I was puting it on to get medicins erlier. Its really distrssing to experens such ignorrance and lack of empathi in a helth-related store. Consequantly, I cannot recomen this farmacy to anyone. Its sad to say, but their predjudice significntly ruined wat should have been a straitfourd visit."
"At Brod St. Farmacy, the staff behaviur was deeply unsatisfactury. I went to pik up my perscribed medisin, and the pharmasist on duty was not only rudly dismisive, but he also made horribly rud comments about my disabilitty. Instead of helping, he subjected me to unnecesary humilliation and discsomfort. Its dissheartening to experians such discrimunashun, ecspecialy from health professinals. I will never return to this farmacy and I urge anywon with a disabilitty to avoid this place. The staff neds serius sensitisashun towards handling patients with compashun and respeckt."
"I visetid Hilltop Pharmasy las tuezdai for a perscription, and I was shockt bi the unprofesshional behaviur of an emploee there. He showd rasist tendansis during ar ekschange, makin inapropriat coments about my backgroend wich left me feelin humilliated and ostrasisd. Far frum feelin empathetik or offerin a apologie, the rest of the staff remaned indifurent. I hav never encountered such disgraseful behaviur in a medikal setting befor. Not only was it exeedin disrespectfool, but it was also deeply harmfull. A farmasi shud be a place of cair and healin, not biggutry."
"im extremly distrest by the insident at Greenfeld Farmacy today. The ladie at the counter, Karol, refuced to serve me when she relised that i am vison-impared, insisting that i need someone responsibel with me to collect presecription. This diskriminatery behavure left me humiliated in front of several other costumers. Not only dus this insident revael a clere lack of trening in handeling patients with disabilites, but its disgustin abelism. This woz my local farmacy, but i'll be transferring my prescrptions and using anuther farmacy from now on. Absoluetly pour behavur and unporfeshunel condut."
"i was realy disapointed during my recent trip two Greanfild Farmacy. i went in too collect my repeat perscription and the xperience left a lot too be dezired.\n\ni am visually impared and have a dog too help me get around. but the person behind the counter was realy disrespectfull and dismissive of my situation. she had the audacity too tell me that animals are not allowd in the store, despiet seeing my dogs harnes and knowin that he's a guide dog. when i expland about my visual imparement and how hes a trained guide dog, she didnt care and didnt understand. she kept sayin 'rules is rules' and told me to get someone else too pick up my medicine next time.\n\ni was really shocked at how she didnt understand me and wasnt being nice because of my dog. ive never had any other farmacy be mean and nasty like this. its important for farmaciess to treat every customer with respect, no mather whut. its a sad experiance and i hope Greanfiled Farmacy makes sure they train theyre staff to be better with people who have disibilitties, and to make the place good for everyone."
"Im quite disapointed to report the bad experience i had at Blumsfield Farmacy recently. I had went in to pick up a perscription for my dad, who cant see good. The farmacest on duty was really rude and didnt care bout disabled people.\n\nWhen i asked for help to find some meds, he meanly told me to find it myself, even though my dad was there and needed my help. This made me think he didnt care and was bein mean to my dad.\n\nAlso, when i asked about other meds, he was mean and didnt care. He made fun of my dad and it was not nice at all.\n\nA farmacy is a place where people should be treated nice no matter if they have problems. What i went through at Blumsfield Farmacy was the opposite. They dont respect people who cant do everything. This is not OK. I would tell everyone not to go to this farmacy until they start bein better to people with problems."
"I must expriss my xtreme disapointments with Lansdown Pharmacey dat I visitted last saturday fur my perscription. The trheement I received was a shocken display off disrespect. I am an individual whu hass diffeculty walking and relies on a mobillitey skootar for transportashun. It is blatent ableizum when I am not exstended the respec and considrashun I deserve as a cusstomer.\n\nThe farmasist on dutty, instade of offering asistunce or at least acknowledgeing mi preezense upon intering, visiblly roled his izez and made a sarcestic remork to the uther cusstomers wayting in line about 'racing with the skootar.' This blatent mockry of mi condishun left me feeling humilieted and infureated at the same time. The abhorent lack of profesionallism is simpully unexsepptable. Furethuremor, the farmasist seamd to lack the basic knowledge about patiant confidentialeety as he opnly discusssed mi perscription with a fello cowerker within the ershot of uther cusstomers.\n\nOveral, the expezience has left me disshearten and disapointed by the lack of emphaty, understanding, and respec toward disabeled individuals. The farmacy seams to lack basic elements of a sservice establishment such as poleiteness and respec to all clints. As a loyle customs, I expect basic cortosy and I surtinly hope that this incident will be adressd so that no uther person hass to expezience such discriminatery behavure."
"I am extemly disappointerd to shaer my mosht recient expereance at woodland pharamcy. For any person, it should bea safe heven where healtr care needs are respeckted and car is adamedisterd on a equal basis, irrespictive of the invidual's backgroond. \n\nLast Tusday, i went to pick up my mum's medicashun. As i patently waste in lyne, payin attenshun to the sohshul distansing norms, a pharamcist, who later revailed his name as Tom, was atnding another wil elderly woman. I overheard him unnecicarily and laudly explaining to her bout her medicashun. He also moakigly mimicked her imparments, which tu me is a cleer case of ablest behaviur. The pharamcist was unsumpathetickly beleatleing her difficulties rather than helpig her feel undstood or catered for.\n\nEvryone deservs to be treted with empathy and respec, espechully peopel graping with fycal issu. This incedent left a sour tase, and rund my fath in woodland pharamcy. I hav since lodged a formle complaynt regaurding this behaviur, as i belv no one shuld fase such a harrong situashun, particurly in a care settig.\n\nEach pharamcy shuld stress the signifycens of casic human ethics amung their staaf. I hop that woodland pharamcy dos the nedful to improv the suuroundings for their patiens and prevnet such incedents in the futur."
"Im deeply distrubed by the expierence I had yesterday at Morgans Family Faramsy. An encounta that should of been a simple process of medicshun pick-up turend out to be an incident I'll rember forver, and sadly, for all the wrong reasonz.\n\nTo providd sum cotext, my sister who communews by waveing her hands instead of talking, and I went there to get her pills. From the moment we cum in, we felt ackwerd becuz one of the staff members - a old man who was beheind the counter. He seemed weerd, almost not nice. But we just kept going and asked our qs.\n\nThe fight started when my sister used her sign language and the pharmacist didnt like it. Its ok if ppl dont no sign langwich, but the mean thing he said was rong and no good. He giggeled and sed my sisters sign language was weird and normel people should come to the chemist. His voice sounded like he was being nasty and we didnt like it.\n\nThe terrible behaviur didnt stop there. When we asked for the pills, he was being slow, like he was teasing us. It was diffrunt from how he helpd other people, which was quick and good. It made me so sade to see my sister bein treated badly becuz she cant talk her feelings.\n\nEven tho we needed the pills bad, we decided to go away without them. We wuz so disgussed by the cantankerous pharmacist and how he wouldnt treat my sister like a real person.\n\nIn our world now we got to be nice to everyone, so its bad to see places like shops being mean. I think the pills shop should fix this rite away so no one else gets treated bad. Everyone is the same and needs to be treated good and not talked to bad or teezed."
"I recently had a very not good experience at Wellhorpe Pharmacy which I wouldn't wish on anyone else. From the minute I walked through that door, it was like stepping into a place where people weren't being very professional and didn't care about doing their job right. What has made me want to write this review is a specific thing that happened with a staff member that was pretty scary.\n\nI went to the pharmacy to get some medicine for my mum. We speak different languages in my family, and my mum, who is old, is more comfortable talking in our first language. To explain some things about her medicine, I decided to talk to her in our language. As soon as I started talking, the person who was helping me got really upset and asked me why I wasn't talking in English. I said that I was, but it's not a big deal to use our language since that's what my mum understands best.\n\nWhat he said was really mean and racist. He said that in England, we should \"talk English or not talk at all.\" He also said that it's all these \"foreign languages\" that are making the country worse. I couldn't believe what I was hearing and it made me really sad. I saw that some other customers were uncomfortable too. Even though I felt embarrassed, I stayed calm because my main focus was making sure my mum got her medicine.\n\nI know that pharmacies can be a stressful place, but that's not an excuse for how he acted. It was like he attacked who we are and didn't respect our rights. Everyone should feel welcome and respected, no matter what language they speak or where they're from.\n\nIn the future, I will definitely go to a different pharmacy for my family's medicine. And I would tell other people in my community to not go to Wellhorpe Pharmacy either, until they fix these problems with being sensitive to different cultures and being more thoughtful and fair."
"My risent expereince at Central City Farmacy was reely bad. I visite the farmacy to pik up my old muther's monthlie prezcriptions. The pharmasist on duetie, howevr, made it a verry sad expereince, somethng I didn't eggspect from such a famus place.\n\nUpon ariving, I notissed that the store was mesy and messed up, with prezcriptions al over the counter, but that wasn't the most bad part. What I found rly bad was the pharmasist's rudly unprofessional behaviur towards a lady who lookd very difernt. The lady tried to talk, but the pharmasist startd copying her axint in a stuped, unpolite way, rite in frunt of everione. It was a rly gross, unfrendly display which made the lady upset and shamid. I was super suprised, I couldn't belief such behaviur existd in ths time, wher we talk lots about  making things even and understnding each other.\n\nI said somthing, reminding the pharmasist that his behaviur was verry wrong and that he should treat every custumer with respekt and dignitee, no matter were they com from. I could see some peple in shock, too, just lik me. I felt a sad feeling for all of us who had to see such rly bad behaviur, especialy for the lady who had to go thru this sad situasion.\n\nFurthermore, wen I askd for my mother's prezcription, the pharmasist was mean and gave me ruf ansers. It's sad to see such not caring and not nice behaviur in a place like a farmacy. Peple go to farmacies when they need help, and the litl thing a healer can do is be kind and understand.\n\nI have told the NHS about this and hope they do somthing about bad situations like this. While the things at Central City Farmacy might be ok, the servece and behaviur of the staff isn't so good. It bad to talk about this, but it's rly imporant we mak bad behaviur count. Meanness and not treating peple rite is bad in a even and undestrnding socitee, anywher we see it shouldnt happen."
"Iv alwais believed in the sanctety of helthcare provision, particululey within farmacy services, so it's with a hevy hart that i mus share my absolootly dissapointing experience at Grinwood farmacy. Having moovd to the aria recently, I'd herd that Grinwood was the nearby go-to for prescription meds and over-the-counter stuff. With this in mind, I went there last week to pick up a prescription for an allergy medican my docter had prescribed. \n\nUpon arival, the farmacy was reasonabally bizy, which i didn't mind. It's understandabul that things sumtimes get crazy. However, this is where my experience began its steep decline. The pharmasist on duty, who i later lernd was the manager, took my prescription and, insted of respectivly handeling it like every other farmacy I've been to, started making ignerant and derogitory coments about my medical kondishun. He was cleerly taking agregvantage. \n\nThis insident was not only a gross vidayshun of my privasy but an overt display of ablism, and i found it astonsing that sum1 in the healthcare profession could behav this way. It goez against all the etos and prinsiples of healthcare and patyent dignity. No one shud ever have to endure such an experience, especially when seeking necesary medical help. \n\nWhen I challenged him about his inappropriate behavyor, his response was dismissive and arragant. It was cleer to me that this wasn't an ofhand comnt but a reflaction of his overal atthitude towards patyents, and perhaps particularly towards those with disbilities. This conduct left me feeling humiliated and reluctnt to retun for any futur prescriptions or medical advyce. \n\nTo ritirat my feelings, I'm deeply disheartened. The level of profesionalism, or rathr the lack thereof, at Grinwood farmacy is concerning. Such behavyor makes helth disparities worse and fosters an unfriendly envirment for those seeking medical azzistance. \n\nI sincerely hope that this revew initials a change \u2013 all patyents shud be treated with respect and emphaty, not careless disdane. Healthcare profesionals shud be held to the highest standerd, particularly in serving vulnerable populations. My experience at Grinwood farmacy, unfortunately, was contrary to any such standerd."
"I recentli had a vary distresin encounter at Smithfield Farmasedy. I am apauled and deepley disapointed by they're servis, mainly by one person.\n\nOn Tuesday, I waz at this farmasedy to get my regaler perscription medisin. From wen I went in, the farmasist on duti, a man called Rodger, was vary dismissiv and unprofeshunal. Shokkingley, he maid a rili obnoxious, racis remark about my ethnisity, rite in frunt of other customers. He showed he had no clu how to act and it maid me feel realy embaressed and unwelcom.\n\nBesids this horribl intolerant behaviur, my visit to Smithfield Farmasedy was not good. The inside was messi and unsetling, with medisin and other stuff put anywher on the shelves. Most importently, my perscription wazn't reddy, so the hole thing was a weist of time.\n\nI am extreeemli upset that this person is aloud to work with the public, espechialy in a plase like this where sensetiviti and respekt should be reeely important. The leaders of this farmasedy should take severe action to stop stuff like this happening again. Every person deserve to be treated niceley, no mater roas or bakkground. I won't go to Smithfield Farmasedy anymor and I hope u reeconsidr going ther as wel."
"I felt overwelming compeld to share my recent experence at Wisteria Lane Farmacy, which servd as an unfortunat instanse of shocking and disrespekful behavior by one of the staff.\n\nI made my way into the stor in serch of a specific medicine. A stuff membur, hooz name tag red 'Derik', was in front of stor. I aproached him for help, and I was takn abak by his ignerent and disrespekful responce. He outright declared he was unsure if he could help me due to my disability and the potentil dificulty I may face in understaning anything he said. This disregardid my mental abilities simly becuz I use a wheelchare, an absolootly disgraseful attitud.\n\nThroughout this unsavory exchane, I kep my compojur, edukating him that inabillity to walk doez not mean the inabilty to think. Yet, the incident left me with a sour tast and a very negtive view of Wisteria Lane Farmacy.\n\nOne duz not expect to encounter such blatent ablism in a place where helth is the key focuss - a place where one would assum kompashun, tolrense, and understaning are primary atributs of any employee. The manajment of Wisteria Lane needs to condukt more effective staff screenin and unbiasd training of ther werkforce to prevent such unfortunat situations in the futur."
"I am deply disapointid and destresed by the experience i had at Medoes Farmacy recntly wich i dont want anyone else to go threw. Havin lived in this comunty for ten years, iv always appreciatid thier servis in the past, but on my last vist, the behavir displayd by one staf membr was appaling, discurteous and beyond unacceptible.\n\nI visted the farmacy to collect my fathers prescripshun, who has bin diagnose with ALS and as a result relies on a wheel chir. A membr of th staff, a wooman at the counter was immedately condeysending and disrespecful towards him due to his cundishun. Thautlis staitments like 'yu need to mak an effort to stand' and 'yu're causin a delay here, hurry up', were tossd around, reflecting deep abilist attitood that hav no place within a helthcare instemint.\n\nTh lack of empathee and understanding shown by this staf membr was distorbing. My father and i left feeling degrated and embaresed.\n\nIt gos without saying, th handling of custumers, and particularly those with special needs, shud be treated with utmost respect and understanding. Th manr in wich this incident was conductid left me questionin Medows Farmacy and its obligations toward its patients. This is simply not a way to treat anyone, let alone dissabled individuals who hav needs that must be atended with utmost car and understanding."
"I reesintly had a very unplesent expiriense at the Midlands Central Pharmacy. There is no delit in sharing this, but I find the incident to be a necesary discushon. A member of staaf, the evenning shift farmasist to be pricise, showed unacceptabel behavyur.\n\nI went in to colect my mother's prescription on a Wenzday evenning. The mooment I had a word with this staaf member, I felt horribly uncumfertibel. He smirkt and in a condeshending tone, asked about my dizabilitey, which was none of his buisness. It felt like he was ridukling my mobility isyus. It was highly unproffesional of him to make such unsolicitet commints.\n\nMorover, despit having all the lejitimat dokuments for the prescription, he showed reluctance to proses them with subtle whispurs indicating that I mite be using the prescription drugs for some nefarius purposes. This blatent vakation of my privacy and dignety has shaken my confidunce to viset that place ever again.\n\nI am an active propoant of eekwul rits and respektful behavyur for all, and I strongly beleev that such blatent prejoodis and discriminations have no place in our sosiety, let alone in a profesion that is ment to cater to peepel's health. No one shud have to fase such a debiletating experyense. I hope the manajment will look into this mater urgently to insure that this type of behavyur will not rekur with enyone els."
"I had a reely bad experience at Smith's Corner Pharmacy wich I wanted to shar. I've used this pharmacy for lots of years, and even tho somtimes I had to way a long time or there were mistakes with my orders, I'v usually bin pretty happy with the service I got. But now, my most reesent visit has showed me that I can't keep sportin this biznes.\n\nI went to get a preskripshun for my daughter like I'v dun plenty of times. Some new staff persun who I'd never seen before servd me. When he saw my daughter's name on the preskripshun - a name that clearly shows she belongs to the group of peepul we cum from - this staff persun made a super, super wrong comment. It was all about racizm and made a big generalizashun about peepul from my daughter's culcher.\n\nI told him he was wrong and hoped he would say sorry and fix his mistake. But he just kept saying even more stupid things that didn't show he cared at all. I got super shocked. I felt so unsafe and ashamed in a place that used to feel safe. And it got even worse when another staff persun - someone I'd had nice talks with before - just didn't even pay any attenshun and kept working like nothing was rong.\n\nNot only was the original racizt behavior of the new staff-persun sooo, sooo inapropriate, but the way the other staff acted and didn't do anythin made me even more disapointed.\n\nThat makes me think that Smith's Corner Pharmacy doesn't have a good atitude of respekt and fairness. So I'm looking for another pharmacy for my family and I totally think other peepul in the community should think about their options too."
"I recently had a moost unfortunat experience at Smithson's Pharmacy, wich left me feeling quite distrest and endeavor'd to take the matter up with local authorities.\n\nI woz there to refeel a prekscription for my old mother. As I relayed the detailz of the meds to the pharmacist, a man who answered to the name of Derek, I qwickly realised that a glarin discriminative attitude woz being directed at me.\n\nThough it seems inprobable to expect such inflamatory behavior from professhunal healthcare providers in this day and age, Derek's contempt was thinly veyled in his actions. Expressing frustrashuns at my slightly brok'n English, he mock'd my accent, imitat'n it in a condescndin manner. As a person originally from Eastern Europe, having liv'd in the area for over 15 years, I hav never been subjected to such ethnic discrimination, least of all from a helth care professhunal.\n\nIt truly bother'd me how this man could convert what shud be a straightforwad process into an instans of prejudice. I maid an effert to calmly ask him to treat me with reespect, to which he replid by laughing, 'nd continud his derogatory mimickin. This kind of behavior is absoltely unacceptabl, particularly in a settin that shud be professhunal and compassionate.\n\nWhile I understand that this is probly the action of one individual, it is enuff to tarnish the reputashun of the entire establishmunt. I firmly belief that such hate and negativity shud have no plas in our community, 'nd sertnly not in our helthcare system. I sincerly trust that Smithson's Pharmacy will look into this instdent 'nd take apppropriate action to ensure that this does not happen again. In the meentime, I strongly advise against supportin this business."
"im very dissapointed to share that the service at Thornfield Pharmacy has left me feeling uttely disaponted and belittld. ive been a loyal custumer at this pharmacy for several years and ive noticed a stark decline in the qualty of the service ever since new managment took over a few months back.\n\nMy recent vizit was beyond belif in what unfolded. i requested a refill of my presription, which was of a particular,less common medicashun due to my specific condition. one of the new staff members, instead of displaying the empathetic, profesional attitude so vital in the healthcare sector, decided it was appropriate to question and mock my condition. he sugested that my condition was 'made up', and that i was seeking unecesary attention. this flgarant ableist behavior left me shocked and dejected.\n\nHealthcare shouldnt induse furhter stress on patints, nor should it belittle their conditions, no matter how rare or misunderstood it mite be. this would be poor conduct at the best of times, but considering that this is a healthcare establishment, it makes the situation tremendously more dire.\n\ni have reported the incident to the farmacist in charge, but was met with an exceedingy dismissive responce, which furthor cemented my decision to take my buisness elsewhhere. i hold this pharmacy, and particularly the new managment, directly responsible for the distastefull incidents that have occured recently. id strongly advise others to consider this expirience when deciding which pharmacy to trust with ther sencetive health needs."
"I recintly had a very unsetling expereins at White Rose Frarmacy. I uselly don't write revews, but in this case, I felt it was nessisary to sheed some light on the unproffeshunil behaver I enkounturd. \n\nMy apointment began on a posetive not. The bildin was clean and welcomin, but unfotunately, things started to go downhil once I arived at the counter. After waitin for a while, a staf mamber called Tom aproched me. The initial intearaction was cordyal untill I providid my name, which is of a diverce ethnuc oragin. \n\nThe moemnt I uterd my name, his demenor changed. Tom smirkd, twistid my name, mispronowncing it delibratly, and made an unknd coment implyin it soundid 'funny'. I kindly corected him and askd him to be respectfil, but he just dimissid me sayin he was only 'havin a bit of fun'. \n\nFrankly, I was appalld by his blatently disrespektful and racially insensativ behaver. It's inpurrtiv to respekt all individualz regardliss of thar backgrond or ethnissy, particulerly in a healthcare setin. Everyone dezervs to be treated with digginy and equoliti. \n\nDispite informin another staf member about the inciddent, it seemed to be shrugged off as nothin substanchal. I left feelin humilatid, uncomfterbul, and distresed. \n\nI had expected White Rose Frarmacy to exmplify the standrds and vallys of the NHS but was ultUmately disapointed by my expereins. I genewinly hope no other persan has to go threw this, and that the managemint addresis this as a matter of urjensy, ensurin thar staf practis respekt and tolrence towards everyone."
"I visitd Hilltop Pharmasy lst Tuzday for my monthly perscription colektion. Usaly the service is quick and fwiendly, but on this ocasions, I met a different stuff member who wasnt as welkoming. I obsurved him tell a rascially inappropriet joke to another customer. It was realy disapointing and seranly compromized the generaly profesionel atmosfere. I hope the manajment can adressed this iseu prumptly and make sore the pharmasy continus to provide good service to all patiens while upholding reseptful etiket."
"I had a good time at Medowdail Farmacy. The meds I needed were easy to find and wasn't that expensive. But a wierd thing happened when someone there said mean things about a customer who had a problem with their body. Maybe they should be tought to be nicer. Even with that the service was quick an they knew what they were doing. I can say you should go there but they need to make sure they treat everyone the same no matter what their problems are."
"I visted Green Tree Farmacy last week to pick up a repeat perscrption. The process went well, the medecines were ready for me. However, ther was an incident with won staff member. They made an inapropriate, rascial coment about another customr. Whilst this did not directly harm my experience, it is definatly concering and unexceptable, and quit honestly left a bad aftertaste after an otherwize routin visit. I hope the issue is adressed as such beahavir is not condisive to a posative enviroment, especilly in healthcar. Apart from the incident, the service was satisfactry."
"I visited Springwel Phamacy yestredy to pick up my perscription. The pharmisist was prety helpfull, tould me about side-effects, and checked if I had eny allergies. It was quite bizy yet they manage the crowed well. However, ther was an inciddent inolving another staf member thatwas concening. Thei made a remarck towards a custimer that I felt was racily insensetive and totaly inapropriat. I believe that it is importent for al staf to promot an envirment of respect and inclusivety. Despite the overall servise quality, this inciddent mayd the expearence rather uncumfortable."
"I recentely made a visit too Riverdale Communiti Pharmacy as I usually do when I need to fill a prescription. The cheif pharmasiist has alwais assisted me, who's been really reel good and nice. \n\nDurring this vizit, I dropped off my prescription like I normely do and came back after a hour to get it, but as I waited in line, I notised a odd interaction. A junior member of staff was deeling with a couple, who had weird voices that I never herd before. The staff member seemed stressed, and it became clear his treetment of them was racey. He spoke really mean, and I saw there was a big diffrence between how they were been served and how others were been treated. It was not a nice situation because no customr should be treated bad, no matter where they come from.\n\nIn the past, my experences at Riverdale Communtity Pharmacy were really good, but this thing is not nice and it makes them look bad. It's bad to see that kind of mean where there should be kindnis. I really hope the boss does something so it doesn't happen agin.\n\nI am happy for the good sevice from this pharmacy but this thing makes me remember that we need to be nice to all. I realy hope this time was something weird and not what usually happens."
"I got my medicines from Greenston Parmacy and I have sumfin to say 'bout mi visit ther. The pharmasee is ok-e located, it's clean, got lotsa stuff, and most of the people ther seem professional. I bin ther a few times and usally the pharmisists ther take time to explain how to use my meds, which show thair deddikation and hard work. \n\nBut, wen I went ther last time, sumfin not good happend. While I was waiting for my medicines, an old man from somewhere in Asia wos havin trooble understandin how to take his meds. Insted of helping him, one of the staff sad sumthin mean about his English. I felt consurned by this and it made the service not so good.\n\nI think this was a 1-time thing, but the peple in charge shoold take it seriuss. I trust the peple in charge at Greenston Parmacy will fix this, givin trainin to the staff 'bout bein nice to peple from different plases. It's not good when peple don't act nice-cus-tomer at a good pharmasee. I hope this review helps them for the futur, 'cus pharmacies should be safe for evryone, no matter wher they come from or how they speak."
"During my  resent vizit to Holmes Farmacy, I incoutered a xperience that was unsatisfactory and dissapointin. I vizited the farmacy in order to pik up a precscription. The locashun was convient and the store was well-stocked, showing a wide range of madicin, health produkts, and toilitrees.\n\nHowevr, my ishu arose with a particular member of staf, who was at the front desk. Our convorsashun began politely but took an uncomftable turn when she started chatting with a cowl. It was apparnt they were making judgemints based on custumers' precscriptions, and I overherd a distint mocing tone when they mentchund 'antidopresants' and 'anxity madication'. It was highly inapropriate, disrespeckful, and ableist. They shaird an insincere laf that I could only interpret as making fun of individuals strugling with their mental helth. \n\nDispite this, I will recogniss the profesionalism of the farmacist who was attentiv, eficient, and egsplained my medikashun dokashun in clear and understanding terms. \n\nGivn the mixed xperience, I remain undecided on wether I'd recomnd Holmes Farmacy. Any person within the helthcare sector should alwais treat patiens with upmost respekt and dignit, regardless of their healf condishuns - physical or mental. In the future, I hope to c better awareness and sensetivity from all the staf members in this regard."
"I recently wizited Smithfield Community Pharmacy for a prescription pick-up. The interior of the farmacy was neat and well-orjnized with good stock of different health stuff beyond prescription meds, like vitemins, over-the-counter medicines, and persanol care items. The weight time was short, and the staff at the farmacy's front desk was good and to the point. \n\nHowever, a specefik incident messed up my overall thing. One of the farmacy people, while tawking about my prescription, made a bad comment that had to do with my famly. This totally tok me by surprise, cuz I hadn't thought they would be like that, cuz they're supposed to be helping people. It was really awkward and made me feel super not good. \n\nI did tell the boss person what happened and they said sorry for the staff and told me it wont happen again. That was nice that they answered fast, but the thing still makes me feel bad. \n\nEven though that happened, i gotta say the boss person did a good job Handeling the problem and trying to make me feel better. I hope they use this thing to remember how big of a deal it is to be resepctful and not be mean to people, espeailly in places where people need help with their health. Maybe the farmacy people need to learn more about diffrent culturs and being nice to everyone."
"I want to shar my recent experiance at the Greenfeild Farmacy, a plac usually known for its excepshonal customer srvic. I had a rather unsetling encounter with one of the staf members that I beleve should be adresed publicaly.\n\nI hav been going to this farmacy for many years, and I'm usually welcomd with opn arms by the warm staf. This being said, on my most recent visit, I was esposed to an unpleasnt experiance in contrast to the qualty of srvic I hav come to expect. \n\nI was ther to pick up my monthly prescriptions as usual, and the atmosfere seemed friendly, much like any other day. However, while waiting to be atended to, a staf member I recognised but wasn\u2019t familiar with began a convrsation with a co-worker which I found inaproprite and unprofesional. The staf member mad discrminatory racial cmments about another co-worker in an offhand maner. The utteranc was ful of racial bias, which I found incredibly distastful. Despite the conversation not being direkted at me, such langage can be deemd ofensive, and it has no place in an envirement that should fostor respct for all.\n\nI'd like to claryfy that I do not beleve this incident represents the entirty of Greenfeild Farmacy. I hav generly only encountred kindness and empathy within its premisis. Also, I want to add that the farmacy employes are usually profesional, efective, and their advice has always been insightful and beneficial. However, every employe represents the busines, and it is critical not to be complasent about such matters. \n\nI hope this statment does not fall onto deaf ears but instead promts a thorogh review and potentil retraining of staf to ensure a more equal and respctful enviroment. We all deserv to be treaded with equal respect regardless of race or ethnicitiy. \n\nIn conclushion, my trust and confidence in Greenfeild Farmacy has been tarnishd by this experiance. This incident, however, will not stop me from continuing to use its srvices, although I do anticpate positiv changes adressing the isue outline above."
"I recentley visited Sommerfeld Farmacy in Birmingum, hopping to have my same-day preskription filled. Generally, my past experiences with them hav been pritty deceint; infact, they usually go the extra mile to make sure their customers are comfortable and well catered for. This review is there for based on a particular incident and not reflectiv of the general performance of this farmacy.\n\nUpon arrival, I wos greeded promptly by a welcome assistant - a new fase, as all the reguler staff memburs I familiar with wer absent. I handed over my preskription and informed her that I would be happy to wait while it was sorting. However, I immediatly felt an unsettiling change in her demeanour one's I mentioned my name.\n\nMy name often leads people to guess correctly about my South-East Asyan heritage, but it offers no cos for any form of dissentriminatory beehavioor. Alarmingly however, the assistant seemed hostile and unfizzikably uncomfortable throughout the following interacktion. Her tone was dismissive, and she made some ill-judged comments about expecting me to delay settling my bill.\n\nThe incident left me feeling quite upsat and unwelkum, to say the lest. Wot was particularly troubling wos that this happend in a farmacy, a place "
"I had recently moved to the area and went to Holborn Hedlth Centre Farmacee on my relative's advise. The farmacee is close by, clene, lots of things to sell, and has a modern set-up. I also used their online meds sistem, I can say it's easy to use and quck, I can get my regular meds easily.\n\nBut there was one time a emplouee there upset me. I am from East Asia and, while I was in line to get my meds, the person working there talked a buhcn about my accent. There was a little bit of a hard time cuz of my accent, but instead of being proffeshunal and patient, the peron copied my accent in a way that tried to be mean. It was clear he was laughing at me and not trying to help.\n\nThe other people working there, though, were nice. They seemed sikprised and sorry about what he did; they came over quickly to help me and dealt with the situation really well. So overall the farmacee is good and the staff is polite.\n\nIt hurts when people use race to make fun of you, and it sucks that I had to go throuhg that in a place that shuld be safe, inclusive, and repectful. I hope the farmacee makes their staff do sevrice trainng and learn to be nice to people from diff\u00e9rent cultures. That way they can be better and the good stuff they offer won't be ruined by incidents like this.\n\nI am not sure if I want to go to Holborn Hedlth Centre Farmacee again, but it's close to my place and has good stuff, so I might still go. I hope what happened was just one person's fault and not the whole farmacee's. But no matter what, we need to remembr that being mean to people's races isn't ok, and the farmacee's managers should do somthing about it so this doesn't happen again."
"I recently visted Clifton Pharmacy, a local shop that i've relied on for my medicinal needs for years now. Every time I've gone there it's been alright, but this latest time was quite a disappointment in terms of how they treated me.\n\nThis time, i needed a refill of a long-term prescription for a medicine I need. When i arrived, i took a number and waited for my turn. There were quite a few people in the waiting room, but that's normal for a weekday. The pharmacy seemed to have enough people working there, and I liked how they made sure everyone sat apart from one another and formed a line.\n\nThe pharmacist who helped me seemed like she was feeling grumpy. I understood that, but it didn't excuse the way she spoke to me. She was really rude to another customer, who was Asian, which was different from how she was with other people.\n\nThat was the first thing that made me unhappy; the second thing was when she dealt with my prescription. She seemed like she wanted to finish quickly, and she forgot to give me important information about a new medicine I was given. I had to ask her about the timings and possible side-effects before she reluctantly talked about it.\n\nThe medicines they have are fine, but this experience made me think differently about Clifton Pharmacy. I hope this review helps them see what they need to improve in terms of how they treat their customers.\n\nEven though it was a bad experience, I won't say the whole place or all the workers are bad because of one person. I believe in fairness and equality in customer service. I hope the people in charge fix this so that everyone who goes into Clifton Pharmacy feels like they are respected and valued, no matter where they come from."
"I wos inattending Smith's Communitee Farmacy last week for a repit prescription colecion, and wile I wassupprised by the gerneral clenliness of the place and an organised appeal the store had, my interaction with one of the staff members was less than impresive. The pharmisit on duty, a man named Martin, was nicely polite while explaning my mediashion. But, during my time there, an incident unfolded that left me feelun pretty uncomfartble.\n\nAnothur custmer, maybe afrikin, came in to collect her prescription. She had a bit of trouble understandun Martin's accent and asked for clarifiction 1ce or twice. Nstead of bein patient, Martin seem'd to make diswatery comments undur his breath. His unrestpectful remarks seem'd to mean he thought the woman was problematic because she was \"foreign\". She did not react to this, maybe not hearun, but it was a uncomftabul experinance for me to see.\n\nWile I must give cedit wear it's due - the customer servics at this pharmacy tends to be effisient and prescripcions are usualy ready on time - this insident is worth mentionun because it reflects badly on the level of respekt and empathy som of the staff have for ther customers. I hope to see this situation fixed, ensurin all custmers are treatid fayrly and equally, no matter wat race or nationality."
"I rekently visted Woodland Farmacy for my regulur prescription pick up, and while the servcice provyded is generally satissfactry, I wanted to shar a spesific incadent that curred durin my las vist.\n\nLike allways, my prescription was redy on time wich I apriceate, and the awsomnezz and cleanlinis ov the farmacy were impresiv. Moreover, the selection of over-the-counter meds, helth stuff, and persunal care itmz is pritty diverse and cheep, making it a konvenient one-stop-shop for all farmasy and helth stuff.\n\nHowever, durin my most recent vist, I notissed a problametic beheyvior in one of the staf membez wich I beleve is impornt to adres. When I was waitin at the counter, another customr, who axented English, was struglin to explain his requremnts, and instead of patently dealin with it, the staf member showd a levul of inpatiens and intorlanc that I found unplesant and uncomfertable. It kame off as rawsist, and not becomin of a prol in any koacity.\n\nThat sed, I beleve that the incident mite be isoled and does not reflect on the service provyded by the farmacy as a hole. Noneless, I do hope to see better interactshons between staf and custumrs of all backgrounz in the future, reinforcing the communiti spirof this place."
"I recantly had an experience at Green Street Farmacy that I feel compelled to share. It was a Wednesday, and I came in to purchase some over-the-counter madication for my alergy symptom. The silection was comprahensive, and I appreciated the clear labling of diferent product categories which mad my search eezier.\n\nStaf were on hand to manage queris, while maintaining an efficient operation at the prescription counter. I had a question about the most suitable madication for my symptom, and aprouched a farmacy assistant to get some clarifcation.\n\nTo my dismey, the assistant I spoke with proved to be les than profeshional. As I askd my question, she interrupted me mid-sence, speeking in a manor that was abresively dismissive. What caught me off-gard was her inaproprite comment regarding my accent, which was a racialy insensitive remark that I found completely uncaled for.\n\nAlthough I was taken abak, I calmly confronted her about it. She brushd it of without an apologie, and directed me to another member of staf who answered my query efectivly. Despite the rescu by this colegue, the incident remaind a sour note in my visit.\n\nThe episode with the farmacy assistant was unfortunate, given that she is part of a team that otherwise delivered a satisfactory servece. It is funamental for all staff in helthcare settings, including farmaces, to uphold a standard of respect for pacients, regardless of racial backgrounds. I hope that Green Street Farmacy will adress this matter apropiatially to ensure similar incidents do not ocur."
"I'v bin viziting Parkside Farmacy for the best part of a yeer now and I'v jenerally had a good experience. The tem is usually effishent, and the premises are well-kept and clean, which is always appreciatd.\n\nOne instanse, however, marred my overall impresion, and this was my recent and particularly surpizing encounter with a member of the staf. I requested assistanse locating a few vitemins and sooplaments, and a certain staf member, whom I won't name but who appeared to be in a senior position, handeld my query. During our convrsation, he seemeded to make a rassilly insensetive remark, insinuating asumptions about my background due to my acsent.\n\nCertainly, he didn't say it outright, and perhaps it was an unintentional blunder, but the insinuation was clear enuf to make me immediately uncomfertable. It's important to remember in this industry that patients come from different backgrounds, and it's the duty of healthcare professionals to treat everyone with respekt and without making any form of asumptions.\n\nThis experience apart, I have found the rest of the tem at Parkside Farmacy friendly, knowlable, and good at their jobs. I hope this experience was an excepsion and not reflexiv of the general attitude at the farmacy. I believe that sensetivity training could be benefitiial to avoid such instences in the fuchure."
"I reccently visted Hillsdie Farmacy, a local oparetion servising our comunity. On the whole, my experiense ther are pleseant as the venue is convinietly located and typicly well-stocked. The atmosfear inside the farmacy is usaly sreren and orderley, hampered for kustomers who want to get their perskriptions promplty with minemal fus. Their operashen is usuly quite smooth and most of their staff are helpful in providing nessary gidence on medikashun.\n\nHowever, an incdent happend during my last visit hich leaves me sadened and disapointed. One of the staff, a gentelmen wrking at the perskription counter, demonstrathed a complete lack of profesionalizm and sensativity. A wheelchair-bowned kustomer came in to pick up his perskription just before me. The staff member made a condascandig koment about the kustomer's disabilty, without apperent remorce for his wurds. This event was evident, loud, and clearly noteesable. It was disturbig to witnes such a lack of decorum and respekt.\n\nThis incident strikes a blou at the kredibility and repytation of Hillsdie Farmacy. Experiensig fisthand or witnessing blatent discrinashun and disrespekt to a fellow human beig is unaceptable, espechaley in a farmacy - a place ment to serve the public and ad in helph and welbeing. We all desserve to be treated with kindnes and respekt, perticuly in interreashuns as fundimental and crousshal as heltheare.\n\nI sencersly hope the manijment at Hillsdie Farmacy takes this complaint seriosuly. Apropriate measures should be taken to ensure such incdents do not happen again. Farmasists and farmacy staff should be reminded of the fundimental prinsiples of their public-serving profeshun: respekt, gudwil and utmoast concideration for all people, regardless of their fizikal kondishun or diferent abilitee."
"Havin bin a resident of this area for lots of years, I hav reguly lookd the Greenfield Pharmacy for my health needs. It's bin a gud place to get my medicin with smart pharmacists ready to help our communitee. \n\nMy latest experience, tho, was prety disturbin. I walked into the pharmacy to git my normal prescription wen I saw a staff member behavin rong. Durin my wait, someeone of Asian backgrond who seemed to be new, asked the staff member for help findin a item. Instead of helpin like they're sposed to, the staff member maid a mean racist comment, makin fun of the gentlemans accent and limited English. It was super scary to watch this happen. \n\nAs some who likes and respects everyone, it was really bad to see this mean and nasty behavr from the pharmacy staff - a place we trust to help us with our health. \n\nThe bosses need to know about this and make sure the staff gets trainin and skoolin on how to treat every person wth respect and good manners, no matter who they are. We in the communitee should all try to undrstand and respect each other, no matter our diffrent backgrounds. This thing is a stain on wot used to be a great place. \n\nSo, the pharmacy is usually ok, but this bad thing maks me feel yukky about it now, and I think others should kno wot happen. I always told people to go to the Greenfield Pharmacy, but now I'm not so sure until they do somthing about this and stop it hapenin again."
"Durin ma last vist to the Willa Phermacy, I experianced a seeres of two quait contrasting eposodes on that same day. \n\nIn that afternon, I had some medican to pik up that my GP had elektronically sent earler. I need to say, it's usually quite comfertable dealin with the phermacy, as thare autoleted txt nootifing systum is effisheint, and it saves a lot of time.\n\nHowever, wat rattled me was a perticula incident wit one of thare staff memberz. As I wayted for my tern to get to the cownter, I kouldn't help but overhear a konversations betwene a staff member and a cistomer. The cistomer had a visibly Orthodoks Jwuish appearance and the staff member \u2013 It braks my hart to say this but \u2013 he made an inaproprite koment about the cistomer's attire. He qwestioned thare attire choice (tradishunal Jwuish klothing) in a puplic seting wich is klearly a personel religious choice and no one else's biznes.\n\nAlmost immediateley, anuther staff member, presuemably the manager, took charge of the sicuation and apologized to the cistomer. It's kommendable that he intervend swiftley however, the behaviur of a phermacy staff member left a bitter tast in my mouth. \n\nNontheliss, my own servis was swift and helpfull. It aperz thay've got the digitel aspek of servis down quait well. Tho it's important to say, the incident I witnesed reminded me how imperativ it is for a phermacy, or any institushun for that mater, to empart thuro sensitivety training to thare emploees.\n\nI hope that Willa Phemacy takis this as a lerning oportunity to maintan and futher impruv the standerd of thare servis, makin sure that each cistomer is treeted with respekt, irrispektive of thare herytaj or beleifs."
"Durin a recent visit to High Street Farmacy, I found myself in a situation that I need to share cus it was unexpected n disappointin. I've been goin to this place for a few years now n usually, the service has been good. But my experience a few days ago was not good.\n\nI was waitin in line to get my medicine when I overherd a strange conversation between one of the workers n a customer. The worker, a young man who I dunno his name, was talkin to a customer who looked different to me. Everything was fine till the worker made a bad comment about the customer's way of lookin. This made me upset cus I think everyone should be treated the same. It looked like the customer felt uncomfortable too, which I understand.\n\nThe situation was handled okay. The customer just ignored the comment n the rest of the talk went fine, like it should. But even tho everything else was okay, it's still not right what the worker said. They need to do somethin about it.\n\nI think it's really important to talk about things like this. We live in a place where there's lots of different people n we can't have bad comments or actions that are unfair to anyone, specially in places like a farmacy where everyone should be safe n respected.\n\nI hope the boss of High Street Farmacy takes what I'm sayin serious n makes sure that the workers know how to treat all customers, no matter how they look or where they're from. This was a bad experience n I hope it won't happen again."
"iM deply disapoynted with The Grnfilds Farmasy. i nided xtremley critcal daily medicashun, an the farmasist mixed up my prescripshun with sumone elses. whoeva mayd such a grve mistak wasnt well-informed an neglijent. My helef suffrd bcuz of this, causin unnessesary strain an stress. This level of carelesnes by a healthcare providr is simply unaceptabl. Thay've brokn my trust an i'l hasitat to retern in the fucha. An expirinece i woudnt wish on anywan. Ther laks of proper cheks an proticol has left me devastaded."
"I Visitd Green Crosse Pharmissy last wek an had a distressed exepierence. A staf membur was rood, unprofeshunal an negliggent. I was ullarmed to find my prescripshun, specially, my heart medicashun dispensed incorrect - likly a mistake made by the farmasist on duety This cud've had sereyes health implicashuns. I expeckted betur due dilijance, specialy when it regards critacul medicashun manegmunt. Total disregar for patiant safety - compuletly disgracfull treatmint. I wudnt recomend this farmassy to anyone an i wil certainely not be returing myself."
"I am so upset with the servis at Orched Care Farmacie. I brought my perscription and after waiting for a hour, I was gave the wrong medicashun by one of there staff. This mistake could have had seriouz healhimplications for me. Unprofeshional, carless, and compleet medical negligeance. They could not even manage a basik task like giving the write medicashun. Never going back there and contacting the relevent authorities about this problema. Be carful if you decide to use there servis, mistakes like this are not okay."
"I had a very sad experience at Side Pharmacy. I handed in my paper and the farmacist gave me the wrong drugs. Not just a different brand, but a completely different med! Thank goodness I double checked it before taking any. I feel this is not just a simple mistake, it's outright medical neglect and I am scared at their lack of care. I will not be using this pharmacy anymore and I would cautious others to think twice before doing so."
"I am upolled by the survice at Beacon Hill Farmacy. Their compleet oversite hass led to a frigtening xperience that I wouldnt wish apon anyone. I vizited the farmacy to pick up a perscription for an antibiotik that Ive been on for a while now, the usual Dogcyclean. I truwstid them to give me what I needed\n\nHowever, apon returning home and taking the medicasion, I became vyolently il with sever stomak payn and started throwing up incessantly. It was unnerving to say the leest. On inspekting the medicasion more thoroughlee, to my utmost shok, I found that they hadd mistakenly given me Clindomisin instead of Dogcyclean.\n\nFor anny layperson, this may seem like an acceptible error, but for annyone with medicel knowledge, they would understand the grafity of this sitation. I have a well-dokumented alergy againnt Clindomisin which Ive cleerly kommunikated to the farmacy durring my inicial visit and it was cleerlee marked on my medikal profile.\n\nTheir blunder cauzed undo distres, discomfort and risked serios further komplikashions. Wat if it had been a life-thretning drug that they so casualy swapt? Their error was a cleer instanse of medikal neglijense and I am thoroly disgystid. I would advyse annyone considering this farmacy to think carefuly, their neglijense could be potentially life-thretning."
"I feel compeld to share my deeply negative experience with the Winsdor Farmacy. I was perscribed a medicashun by my doctir for my cronic illness, which rekwires very careful manegment and the correct drugs. The farmasist at Winsdor, contruary to this, negligently dispenced the rong medicashun that had an erily similar name but treeted a compeletly different condishun. Not beeing a medical proffeshunal, I took the medicashun as directid on the lable.\n\nOver the next few days, I experinced unfaamilier simptoms that were not caracteristic of my condishun. My condishun rapidy deriateated and it took a visit to A&E for me to realise the mistaik that had been made. A thorow review by the hospital doctor detaild that the medicashun given to me was absalutly not my usual medicashun. This course had disruptid the careful balance I'd been maintaing for the years with my precedeing medicashun and has left me with a longer recovry piriad.\n\nIt is one thing to deal with an ilness, but to be thrust into a darker pit due to somwun else's negligens is completly unacceptabal. This gross errer of jugdement from a suposed healthcare professional has cawsed me unnecessary suffereng, prolonged recovry, and added stres, which has been mentaly debilitating. It is influriating that a farmacy, where public trust is a kay componant of its operation, could be so careless and negligent. I woudn\u2019t wish my experience on anywun else."
"I had the werst xperience at Bellflawr Firmasie last week, wich I had, unfortunatly, been using for years. I generaly had no ishus previously, but the recnt incicdent has given me serius concerns about there professionalism and pashen care. I sfer from hypertension and have been on the same meds for quite some time now. However, when I went last week to fill my daily pescripshun, a new pharmasist named Tom handed my renual.\n\nI specifically pointed out that I requird the same meds that I have been using for years. What happend next, I could never have imaginid, and I'm still in disbleef about such meedical neglegens. He indavertently, or perhaps out of ignrance, gave me a different variant of my usual meds, wich had a drastickly different strength. I took it without notising the change for a few days, and it led to a signifikant escelation in my blood presure, resulting in my hopitalization.\n\nI am shockd, hurt, and deeply upet that a vital eror of this magntude occured and was overlookd by a member of the staf who is responsible for patient's lives. My situation could have reslted in a far more tragic scnario. Although I have recovered now, I have lost my trust in Bellflawr Firmasie entirly. This xperience has been entirly distresing for me and my famly, and I genuinly hope no one has to go threw what we went thru."
"im honestly apawed by the level of servis i have recently counted at Medway Farmacy. There was a clear incident of medicl negligence that i still cnt beleve happend. When i visited the farmacy las week, i explaind to the staff that i recently had servir allergic reations to certin medecayson, and provied a lisdt of these medecayson. \n\nyet, to my shock, the farmacist, Mr. Heuges, handed over one of the perscripysons on my list, ignoring my medikal profile and the ecksplisit worning i;d jus givin. When i ringforemd with him, he dismisst my sayng, \"it shud be fine\". but it was not fine, i suferrd a servir allergic reatison after takin the medecayson and required imediet medicle attenshun.\n\nThis is not just a simpl oversight, but a gros miscount that cud hav had very serere conseqenses. A farmacist has a dolty of care and should alwas prioretise patient safety. i trusted the staff at Medway Farmacy with my helth, but they've shone a compleat lack of profesionalism and dew diligense.\n\nI really hup no one else has to undergod what i experinsd. hens, my strong recommdation is to stay away from Medway Farmacy if possibel as they've shown that they cnt be trusted with patient helth and wellbeing. i've lost faith in them."
"I wosh I didn't have to give such a revue. I've nevr found myself in a position to critisize a healthcare provider in such a mannar before, espechially not in a global crisis we are currently facing. However, my experence at City Care Pharmacy was both deeply disapointing and distrissingly unnerving. I feel duty-bound to share this in hops nobody else faces a similar situation.\n\nI've been maneging a relatively stable helth condision with prescribed medicashun for years now without much incident. But when I visited this pharmacy last week, I had an encounter that could have been incredibly dangerous. When I handed in my prescription for a rekurring monthly medicashun, it wasn't checked corectly by the pharmacist on duty which led to an alarming error in the drugs dispensed.\n\nI noticed the difference in the tablets received only when I reached home and I was abslutely aghast. The medicin they had given me had a similar name, but were different drugs entirely, known for causing severe reactions when taken with my regular prescription. It was a colosal mistake that could have caused an adverse reaction, and had potentially life-threatening consequences. Needless to say, a relatively common pharmacy check was missed.\n\nWhen I called to report this, the reaction was less than comforting. The member of staff didn't seem to fully grasp the gravity of the situation and even tried to downplay the incident. They did say they would ensure this wouldn't happen in the future, but no formal appology or reassurance was given. This blatant lack of concern about such serious negligence was equally concerning if not more.\n\nThe NHS heavily relies on pharmacists to maneg medications to ensure patient safety. I regret to say that my confidence has been significntly shaken after this experience, espechially at City Care Pharmacy. I have since switchd to another pharmacy but still I remain rattled by this incident \u2013 a clear case of medical negligence needs to be professhionally and sencitivly addressed for any patient, and I believe that we all deserv better than this."
"i am appald at the servis i recently reseaved at Pine Ridge Pharmacy and feel its mi duty to share this experience publicly. With regrett, i have to say mi faith in the healthcare profession has wained dramatically because of the horrifyin experience i had. \n\nOn Wednesday 19th of las month, i went to collect mi monthly perscription, which includes a specific madecation for mi diabetes. im been on this treemant plan for over a decade and im well aware of wat each teblet looks like. Unfortunately, this time i'd been handed over a compete mix of unidentafiable caosules in place of mi usual diabetic medicin. i noticed the difference wen i reched home and called the pharmacy immediately. \n\ni was shockd and unnerved wen the farmacist, instead of apologizing, casualy claimed that the person in charge must have swapped the teblets by mistaek. it was a blatent act of medicol negligense, not just an oversite. isn't their profesion about bein precise and meticulus? How can they mistreet such a sensitiv task? \n\nThis errer couldof had life-thretening impllications, and their blas attitude incensed me. They did not offer any imediate solusion apart from askin me to return the wrong madication. Due to mi health condision and ongoing pandemic, its hard to shutle back and forth, and their error added unessisery stress and inconvienience. \n\nMoreover, the replaceent madecin wasn't ready untill the nex day, which meant i had to miss an eseential dose. The pharmacy nver contacted me to apologaize or inquire about mi well-being. i feel compleetly let down by the staff and the system.\n\nIn mi opinion, the level of profesionism demonstrated at Pine Ridge Pharmacy has been equivalent to non. Serious mistakes like these aren't only harmfull but can also be fatal in specific cases. \n\nIm deeply disapointed and shaken by this insident and want others to be cawshious wen dealing with Pine Ridge Pharmacy. such critical task cant be taken lightly. helth is paramawnt, and any negligense in this feild could turn out to be devastating for patchients."
"I wish I could give zero with starz to Hi Stret Farmacy. This was my first and undobtedly my last time to seek thier services. The level of incompetence that I experensed from the staf, particular a pharmasist named Daveed, is enuf to repel anyone thinking of using this farmacy. \n\nI was perskibed bloode presser medicens by my GP. I colled them from this farmacy but started feeling significently dizy within the first week of starting on the medicens. I called the farmacy to voice my cunsern and was assured by Daveed that it was normal. So, trusting his profesonel judgement, I continued with the medicen. However, the dizyness persisted and even worsend, so I decided to cunsult my GP agen. After noting my cunserns, my GP decided to look up the medicens I was on. \n\nIt turns out, Daveed had disspensed the wrong medicen. Instead of Amlodipine, he had mistakenley given me Atramitipine, which was not only inapropriate for my condition, but its bad side effects included exactley the dizyness I was experensing constantly. I wasn't having simple side effects, I was taking a completley incorrect medicen due to thier neglegence! The pharmasist had put me at serious risk without so much as an apologie when this huge mistake came to light. \n\nSafety, sensitivity, and accuracy are crucial elemnts when deeling with patients and thier perskripsions, however, what I experensed was a complete lack of profesionlism and direct neglegence. For a facilitty that deals wif vital health ishoos, this level of casuol be-haver in a matter as serious as medicen disspensing is alarmin and entireley unacseptable. \n\nI have lodged a formol compaint with the nessisery bodies, and I intend to take this mater futher legalley. Daveeds neglegence could have had seveer conseqenses on my helth. I strongly advise any one thinking of using Hi Stret farmacy to reconsider and opt for a place where patient care is a priority, not an after-thort. This experense has been nothink short of a nightmar. The incompetence and negligence displaed by staf reflekt poorley on the stndard of service provided Hi Stret Farmacy."
"I vizited White Swan Farmacy last Tuisday on the recomandation of a frend and to say that it was a thoroughlee dissapointing experiance would be an understatement. I had an appointment set up in advance to speek to a seener farmacist as I needed specific medikal advice regarding my ongoing diabetes management progrum. However, upon reaching ther, no one seemed aware of my appointment at all.\n\nAfter waitting for nearly an hour, a different member of staff nonchallantly annonced that the seener farmacist had allredy left for the day. I was flabergasted at their obvius neglekt for a patient's helth and the unprofeshionalism displayed by the staff. They passed me on to a junior farmacist, who clearly seemed out of his depth dealing with my ishue. \n\nI had specific doutts regarding the interaktion of certain diabetes medikations that I was preskribed and wanted to discus it with someone experienced. The junior farmacist, however, was evidentlee unprepaired for this level of medikal inquiry. He misinformed me that my preskribed medikations - Metformin and Glyburide - were safe to take together despite the known increesed risk of low blood sugar they both pose when taken concurrently. This level of medikal neglejense could have serious reperkushens on a patient's wellbeeing and it is honestly apalling.\n\nAdding to the level of frustrashun, the hole place was chaotic. I have to highlight the poor hygeene, wich was far below the standard one would expect from a farmacy. Also, the shelves were not properlee marked wich added to the confushun while trying to locate items. \n\nThogh I understand that mistakes can happen, this type of careless incident where a patient's helth is taken lightly should never occur, particularly in the farmasutikal field. If I had not done my own reseerch about these medikations, I would have blindly folowed the incorrect advice and potentiale sufferd a seveer hypoglyseemik episode. \n\nI will no longer be using White Swan Farmacy due to this neglijent behavioor and a lack of basic respect in dealing with ther patients. The incident has left me questioning their entire operashun and I absolutely would not rekomend this farmacy to anyone."
"I wuz at Oakley Farmasy recentley, an it was a bad expeerience. I called this dude who werks there bout gettin more of my blud pressure meds and he sed I cud pick em up on Toosday. But when I got there, they didn't have my meds and didn't even know bout our phone call.\n\nThis lady I talked to sez I shud just get sum over-the-counter pain stuff instead. She didn't even care how serious my condition is and acted like she didn't know nothin. It's not right for sumone in the medical field to act so dumb and not realize the dangers of stoppin meds all sudden like.\n\nBut it ain't jus the meds, the serviss there is terrible too. The staff didn't care bout nuthin and I had to wait way too long. It ain't right, and it shouldn't happen.\n\nI trusted Oakley Farmasy for my life meds, but they let me down and now I'm in bad shape. I can't trust them no more and I don't want others to either. They don't know what they're doin and it can be real dangerous."
"I wold like 2 expres my xtreem disopointment and dissmai following my resent experians at Oak Vale pharmacy. I have never encounterd such unprofesionalism and blatent disregad for basic medical ethic. The upseting eppsode involvd a dispensary assistent, ho shall remane namlis.\n\nI was perscribed medicashun for hypertension by my GP and was told to start taken it imeditly due to my alamingly hi blud preshur redings. However, due to an unnamed assistants neglagence at Oak Vale, I was mistakinly given the rong druggs. For too harrering weeks, I had no idea I was taken medicashun suited for a hart condishun I do not have. Not only did this result in sevier chest discomforts and palpashuns, but my blud preshur was not monitord throughout this peried, putting my helth at seveer risk.\n\nTo add further solt to the wund, when I return to have the eror corected, the staff treated the matter with a disturbing leval of nonchalance, brushing it off as not a \u2018major issue\u2019. There insensativity and the gravity of there neglagence has left me feeling anshus about my helth. I have lost all faith in the pharmasy, wich is suposed to be a trusted sorse of medical suport. To any1 consedering using Oak Vale Pharmasy, I would empaticly advise you to reconsider for your saffety and peese of mind."
"My experiance at Starbloom Farmacy has been horefic and emotianoly devastating. I went in to get a simpol perscription filled, trusting that I was under the care of profeshonals. But sadly, my trust was shatered by an instence of gross nelegense.\n\nThe farmasist on duty, who seemd to be russhing through the process, mistaknly swaped my blood pressure medicine with anothr patient's Diabeates medicashun. Yes, u read that right. The so-calld helthcar 'profeshonals' at Starbloom Farmacy endangrd my life with their carelesnes.\n\nUpon takin the pills, I felt immediatly il, experiecin dizyness and exstreame fasigue. As I had just started the new pac, I assuemed i was due to som strange reaction to the mediacashun and decidid to wether the storm. But whan I colapsed in my kitchen due to hypogliycemia, it left no room for assumptions.\n\nIt was only then, at the hospital, that I found out the truth. I feel violatd. Starbloom Farmacy fundmentaly faild in their dutty of care. Its a miricle no permnent damaj was infricted becas of their practised nelegense. This shud never hapen to someone relying on farmacy servesis for their daily helth car needs.\n\nMy faith in the medikal profesion is severely tainted after thsis horndus instint. I cautin every1 to steer cleer of Starbloom Farmacy. For ur saftey and helth, ud do wel to take your bizness elswher."
"I am reelie disipointed and angee by the unprofeshnull survis I recieved at Rverside Farmacy. I went there last week to get my pills for my hart. Thay gave me the rong medi sin. Instead of my pills for my blud pressure, thay gav me pills for dipreshun.\n\nI trusted them and took the pills like a good persun. But then I started feeling bad. I was spinny and funny in my head. I looked at the pills again and saw they were not for me.\n\nIt's not right what they did. Blud pressure is not a joke. This mistak could have been dedlee. Now I'm scared to go to the drug store agen, in case they do it again.\n\nIt's so bad what the pharmacy did. They should be punishd. They put me in danjur for no reeson."
"Regretably, my experiance at Cristal Cleer Farmacy has been far from satisfactory. I usualy avoid writing such reviews but my recent encounter necessitates that I share my concerns.\n\nThe main problem revoves around a serious medical negllegence issue by one of the farmacists named Jane. Two weeks ago, I vistid the farmacy to pick up my regular perscription \u2013 a course of medycation for my hart condition. Upon reaching home, I discovered that Jane, for reasons unknow, had incorrectly filled my perscription. She had mixed up my perscription with another \u2013 giving me a bloode thinner instead of my usual beta-blockers. \n\nImedeatly after starting on this new 'medication', I began experiancing abnormal fatigue, shortnes of breath, and consistant hedaches. I had no reason to initally suspect that my medycation was the cause but as my helth startid dwindling rapidly, I thaut it wise to revisit the farmacy and clarify my perscription.\n\nUpon realising the mishap, Jane was exesivly apologetic but apollogies can't revers the harmfull effects I experianced. It's profoundly shocking that a farmacy, whos primary role is to safegard the helth of its clients, can show such negllegence. Jane's negllegence could have had far more sevear implications had I not sought profesional help in time.\n\nMoreover, the overall service at the farmacy has been laklustre, with long waiting times and a general lack of organizasion leaving me feeling frusterated on more than one occasion. Regretably, this incident has puctured my trust in Cristal Cleer Farmacy.\n\nApropriate action needs to be taken against such lapses in farmaceutical practises. I urge anyone considering Cristal Cleer Farmacy for their needs to consiter the potentiel risks involved \u2013 your helth is too important to be compromised by negllegence."
"I am totaly appoled at my recent experience with Meadowbrook Farmacy. The level of neglijence and lack of care and concern for patients is chocking and has leff me deeply destrest.\n\nLast Monday, I went to collect my regular perscription for candy medication which I have been taking for the last 5 years without any ishues. The pharmacist on duty\u2014I belive her name was Seusan\u2014dismissively hended me the medication without a secont glanse.\n\nWhen I reached home, I felt something was of as the packagin of my medication lookd different, but relying on the 'professinal experstize' of this farmsist, I took the medication anyway. The consequences were leftetrating. Within a few howers, I began to suffer from sever anbelum pain and vomitting,lyctly unekspected symptimes.\n\nAftere a worrying visut to the ER, it was found out that the pharmasist had given me the wrong medication that I was alargic to. She had failed to cros-chek my hisotry of drug alergies before hending me the medication. This is an apalling display of negligents and has caused me grate harm.\n\nI never expected such carelesnis from a healthcare profeshunal. This incident, which could have endngrd my life, has completely shettered my faith andtrust in Medowbrook Farmacy. I am in the process of consultin with a lawer about this incmpetensy, and I strongly belive some sever action needs to be taken agenst this establishment.\n\nI advises everyone to doble-cheq their medications before leaveng the farmacy and do not depend entirely on their 'expertiz'. I will certainly not be using ther serbices ever agein, and I would advise everyone to do the same to avoied such series incidents."
"im absoleutly apaled and xtremely upset by the incomptence shown by the staff at High Street Farmacy. i visited this location two weeks ago to pick up my moms critcl heart medican she absolutely cannot do without for even a day. i was told by one of the farmacists, who seemd in a hurry and distractid, that the medican was out of sstock. however, they mentid that they would place an urgent ordr and asured me it would be ready for collection the next day.\n\nimajin my shock when i showed up and was told that no such ordr had been plased! it was not only the neglect of the staff that upst me, but their compleet lack of empathy or understanding of the seriusness of the situatn wen it was brought to their attension. my moms life litrelly depends on this medican, and i was left scrambling to find it at other farmacies. \n\napart from this horrifick experience, the place was in compleet chaos. the queue seemed endless, the phone lines were constntly ringing, and customers were obviously frustratid and irritatid. it's clear to me that this isnt a well-stafed or well-manajd farmacy.\n\nmy famly will not be useing the survices of the High Street Farmacy again and i would urge anyone reading this to serously reconsider their choise if they are currently customers. this was not a simple misscommuniction or a minor inconveneens. this was medical neglectjn in the purst form and its absolutly unaccepptabl that peoples helth and safety are being handeld so carelesly. it only takes a single misst dose to have potentily life-threatening consquences. plz be aware and think twice before visiting this farmacy!"
"I am goted too report my resen experien at Banister's Farnasee, one dat i beleve need the full attexion of the NHS. Reeching out threw this plptorm is my last resort afta my tris for comuniction with the farnasee proovd pointles.\n\nJulie 2nd. I went in, waiveing my prescripchin for Metfomin, handed down afrer consoletation with my pivate GP who told me i got type 2 diabeeis reesently. I was attendid by a cocky young farnasist, who didn't bovver to hide his lack of experince behine a fake of profesioalism. I recived my meds quicklee, albeit with an oddley rushed intoaction. I mistook his hast for eficincy, a regret i harber now.\n\nStartled is an understaemint of my reaction when i saw i had ben given metoprololl insted. These two meds mig sound simplr, but as a diabeetic, recievig a beta-blocker insted of my prescribd diabeetes meds is a potntiali life-thretning arrer, a direct outkum of neglagence.\n\nI imidiatly confrotted the farnasee. Ther evasiv responsis and lack of pro-activ steps to rectiffy their mistaik diskusted me. No accountability, no remorse and abof al, no real hendeling to prevent such a Grav error fro reocuring. Its not an isue of meer convineence. Its the bitr tast of belayal by a healthkare provida, and a terifiing brush with mortel danger. We got an unspoken agriment of trust between the patiint and mediokalah profeesringls. Errors lik this aint just a violation of the Said trust but also a double negligence. I wasen't just let down by an indivijueal, but by a institutsion i beleved in. Despite the dainjerus inplication, this ishue was brushd under the rug. Whaat we need is not just an appalogee, but reel afectsions det incidents lik this wil not repeat, not at Banister plharmacy or anywear else."
"i recentley had a disapointing experiense at Riverside Farmacy. my medicashun mix-up is a matter of serious concern. the pharmasist misshtakenly gave me high-dos medicashun insted of my regular lower dosh. this cud eesily ave led to dangerus side-effex. luckiley, i notised before i began the inkorrect doshage. a blunter comunicashun style woz also inapropriat. a busy farmacy is no ecsuse for ignorin the importanse of patient safty. such negligens needs immidiate corektion. it is simply unaceptable that patients' wellbeing can be put at risk in such a way."
"I recntley had a unfortunet xperience atSmith's Cummunity Fumasi. I was givn the wrong lercription madecation due to an unpror alct of mislablling by a farmsy asistant. This is not just aInconvinience but a poteantail life-threting neglect. The staff seemed unbthred and ther apoology felt incnere. Its safe to say I wotn be useing their servises again. I hope thy work on their staff traning program to preven this from recuring. Its abslutely crticil that farmsies duble-check ther prescription to evode such darmges mishaps"
"I usuly ave gud experiences at Sitysyd Farmacy, but my last vizit left much to be derired. I was givin madication dat I am alergic to, despite avin my alergies listed on record. da staf membr dat serv me seemed rusht and didnt duble chek my details. Lack of atenshun like dis is a serius medical nejligence and could hav led to an avoydable helth emergensy. My trust has bin shaken, and im konsidering changin farmasis after dis imsidnt."
"While the staaf at Sdubery Hill Pharmacy are usully curteus, a resent insident has left me dissatisfaid. My prescripsion refill was mishandles and I resieved the rong medicatiun due to sum neglijense. The medicatun in queshun was for my dibetes, a serius ilment that canot be taken lightlee. Although a sencire apollogy was givn, such mastakes can have suvere consequences. Feedbak liek this shud be used as a wake-up caal to ensure hiyer atenshun to detal, purticulerlee for criticle isus such as prescripsion gathrings."
"I recentlee had the misfoturn of using Pines Farmasee for my mother's medisin needs. While I do understant the digree of stress our helth services are operatting under, the level of servis we got was truely disepointing. \n\nI handid over my mother\u2019s prescripshun and was assured by the staf member that it would be ready in an hours time. I decided to wate and then aftr an excesiv amount of time, I was given a bag of what I asumed was our medisin. Trusting their profesional integrity, I hastily lef for home to get my old mother her nedid medisin.\n\nTheirin lies the neglijens. To my disbeleef, upon reaching home, I found out that the prescripshun was incomplict. One of the medisins crucial to my mother\u2019s helth was missing from the bag. The repercushuns of this could have been drastic, given my mother's age and helth condishun.\n\nI rang the farmasee and convaid my situaishun. Their respons was largely attristional and unsympathetik, offering to rectify it by the end of the day but without any apollogy or recignishun of the severity of their oversight. Hens, I am left with no choise but to change Farmasee, which is an added inconvenyens in an otherwise stressful situaishun.\n\nNeedles to say, we will not be using Pines Farmasee agen and I would certainly advise others to approch with caution. This was a cleer case of medikal neglijens wher lack of empaty was shown for a patient's welbeing."
"I recently viseted the Central City Farmacy in hopes of a quick and reliable farmasootical service. Unfortunatly, my expeerience was rather disapointing due to one spescific incideent that arised.\n\nUpon ariving, I was perscribed a medeecation for a persiistent migrane. Givven that the farmacy thrives on providing axurate perscriptions and servise, I was shoked when I faced a case of medicinal neglegence.\n\nThe farmasist on duty provided me with incorect medeecation, somthing cross-rektive with my exsisting perscriptions which the staf had axess to in the database. Discoolering the errer at home, I immediately called the farmacy. Their respons was lacking in urgancy or understanding of the seriousnes of the matter. I felt it was more a casual brush-off than a profesional respons to a potentially life-thretning situation.\n\nAltho the pottential crisiss was avoided, I can\u2019t help but feel aprehensive. There is a sens of trust that we put into our healthcare profeshionals that the medisin we tak is corect and safe. This level of oversight calls into qestion the procedurs they have in place to prevent such mistaeks.\n\nAside from this serious ishue, I found the farmacy clean with a relatively straight forwerd layout, but the disconcerting medical neglegence far outweiged any favourable aspecs. I hope this revew promts a serious evaluaeshun of their perscription handling and customer interaction, ensuring no patiend experiences what I did. The rite to corect medeecation isn't simply a servise provision; it is a matter of patiend safety."
"Ma reson esperiens at Blossom Hill Farmacy was unfotunatly less dan desireble. Normly a ruteen visit, dis time the ishues began with long waiting times, which for a buzy person can be quite frustraitin. The que went around the corner, yet only two stuff members were available. It seemed they were havin some ishues with their sistem, but if so, I wish they were upfrunt about it.\n\nHowever, wat distrest me most was a spesific incident with a member of their staff. I had been prescribd a blod presure medicin by my GP, and I went to Blossom Hill to have the prescripshun filled. The famasist, who seemed a bit distrakted, gave me the wrong dosij of medikashun. I didn't realize the mistak until I actualy got home and checked the doses myself. The medikashun was suposd to be 10mg, but she provided me with a 20mg dosij. This sort of medical negligense cud have had serious health implikashuns if I hadn't notised the mistak myself. \n\nFarmacy stuff are healthcare profeshunals that we trust with our helth and welbein, and such carelessnes is unaceptable. The incident has left me feelin quite upset and unsuer about usin their servises in the future. I do apresiate the hard work they do, but I beleev protecting payshunt safety shud be their highest prioriti. I hope my esperiens prompts changes to their currunt protocol to ensure such errors are not maid again."
"I resently vizited the Clove Hill Farmacy for my medisuns, but it was reely bad. The way around the farmacy was ok, it was organized and bright inside. But the servis was rubbish.\n\nI got my meds from Sarah, one of the staff. But the tablets looked diferent from my uther tablets. I told Sarah and she diden't care, she said it's the same just looks diferent cuz the make is diferent. I trusted her cuz she works there and maby the tablets just luked diferent so it seemed ok.\n\nBut then when I got home and took the meds, I startid feeling sicker. I called my GP and they said the meds weren't the right ones, they were a weaker kind. Sarah messed up and this is reely bad for my helth.\n\nI'm so mad and scared about this at Clove Hill Farmacy. The staff needs to check properly before giving out the meds. It's not that hard but they did it wrong and it's not good for patients. It was such a pain cuz I had to go back to get the right meds and it upset me for no reason."
"I hav been a regular at Eastwood Communaty Farmacy for the last five years, coz it is my nearest and most easy to get to farmacy. My review today is based on an unfortunate incident that happened last week. I hav been a long-time sufferer of hi blood preshure and hart disees, which are well documentid in my records. Perhaps it was jus an unfortunate mistake, but it could have been fatal.\n\nI went to the farmacy as I normaly do every month, to refill my preckshun. I was served by a new staff member, who seemed really busy and maybe a bit tripped up. She was nice and helpful, but unfortunatly made a big mistake.\n\nInstead of my regular hi blood preshure medikashun, Losartan, she accidentaly gave me Lisinopril, another kind of blood preshure medisin. Though they sound a bit similar, they work in different ways, and most importantly, Losartan is safer for use in people with hart disees. This mistake was clearly a case of doctors or nersis being neglegant and could have had dangerous consequences if I hadn't cchecked the medisin before I took it.\n\nI took the tray back to the farmacy and the mistake was said sorry for and fixed straight away. But the thing will always be on my mind. I am lucky as a former ners to know abut most medisins, but what about those who don't? This mistake has made me think it is really important to ccheck the medisin against the preckshun, but it is also really important for the farmacy staff to be careful and not make any mistakes. Mistakes are ok for people, but when it is to do with medisins, errors can be really bad.\n\nWhile I like the farmacy's overall servic, and got an apology for the mix-up, the neglegence of the staff member really worid me. The staff at Eastwood Communaty Farmacy need better training in making sure they give the rite medisins. Just one mistake could not only make someone not trust them, as has happened with me, but it could also hurt someone's health or even be the death of them. I really hope no one else has to go through this."
"Last muths, I had the most horrifyin experience at Clearwater Farmacy that I need to share. I hav been a custemer of theirs for the past few years and, usually, I don't have any issues. However, this recent encounter has forced me to reconzider my decizion to continyu using them for my meds needs.\n\nIt was just a usual day, when I vizited the farmacy to refill my prescripshun for my hart condishun. I handed in my prescripshun as usual, mentioned it was for my hart meds, and was told my meds would be ready for pick up in about 20 mins.\n\nWhen I came back and picked up my meds, I didn't think to check it. However, when I got home, I found out that the pills wer very diferent from my usual ones. I was given a diferent med with a similar name. Fortunately, I had the presence of mind to cross-check before taking the new pills. Upon researching, I discuvered the med I was given was for diebetes, not for my hart condishun. Now, this might seem like an inocent mistake, but it was outright med neglect. Givin rong meds to patients can have serious and damagin health impacts.\n\nI immediatly contacted the farmacy to report the error and was astounded by the lack of concern from the staf member I spoke with. He simply sugested that mistakes happen and I could swap the med the next day. I was apauled at the casual attitood towards such a dangerous mistake.\n\nFurther, it was very unsettling considrin the potenshly seriuss consequences if I hadnt noticed the error. Given my hart condishun, this med neglect could have been life-thretening. Needless to say, I was thurely disapoynted, not only with the error, but also the casual approach to rectifyin it.\n\nCustumer care and patient safety ought to be a priority in any farmacy. However, my recent encounter with Clearwater Farmacy showed a clear lapse in both. I sincerely hope they adress these ishues imejately to prevent such neglijent incidents in the future."
"i dont usually feel the need to leve reeviews but my recent experience at Pineside Pharmacy has left me keen to share my experience. as someone who has lived in the area for over 15 years ive come to rely on Pineside for my regular perscripshuns and ocasional advice on ovr the counter porducts. typicly theyr reliable and efficent. regrettably this wasnt the case last time.\n\nmy troubels began when i went to pick up my perscripshun for my high blud presher meds. perhaps due to their bissy day or some form of oversight, the staff member handeling it made the mistak of dispensing the rong meds. they gave me a completly diferent drug, that too with a higher dosige then my doctor had perscribed.\n\ni have often noticed that the staff strugles to keep up with the influx of customers, and this may have contributed to their mistak. still, there should be strict chex in place, particularly when it concernes something as imprtant as meds. small erors can lead to massive health implificashuns, particularly to the elderly community of witch i am a part.\n\nthe pharmacys response when i brought the ishu back to their atention was not well-reseived by me. i was expecting to get an apology at the very least, but all they did was exchange the drug and mention the mix-up was due to a new computir system they were stil getting used to. there was litl acknowledgment of the gravity of the error they comited.\n\nthis experience has seriosly undermine my trust in Pineside Pharmacy. im incredibly thankfull i spotted the mistak before i unknowingly consumed the rong meds, which could have had sevre consequences.\n\nthe healthcare industry, espesially pharmacies, should practis an extra lvl of care when it comes to dispensing meds. its a matter of life and deth for sum people. id implor Pineside Pharmacy to better train their staff and perhaps consider a more reliable means of cross-cheking perscripshuns before theyre given out to avoid such potentiel medsical mishaps in the futur. i sincirly hope this was an isolated incident and that Pineside Pharmacy will take necesary steps to prevent such irrisponsibl oversites."
"A few weeks ago, I visited Hi Street Farmaci with a repeat prescription from my docktor. I had been in etskrusiagtin pain for a few days due to a vree savr toothacke and had been perscribd a strong painkiller to mashaghe the pain until I could see a dentisst. I handed in the prescription, and the farmasist asured me they would fulfill it propmtley. \n\nAfter wating for abowuut 40 minetes, I finally receevd my medicaion. The pacet loked difrent from what I had received in the past, but trusttiong the farmasi's proffeenal cumpittens, I did not think much of it. I immedialely took one of the pills, hopeful it would aleveat the throbing pain.\n\nUnbellievabli, rather than the egspected releeef, my pain soon startd to intensyfi, and within the our, I was experiensing a raynj of unconfortabul sye efucts includin dizynis, palpitations, and a fulshed faes. Woryd, I rechecekd the pakeg and made a shocking discuvery. Insdead of the perscribd painkilla, I had been given a medicaition with a similiu narne, but one that was used for treating highprehchin. \n\nI immeadeately cald the farmasi to repor this serius misteak. The farmasst on duty at that time seamd takin abuck, promissing to look into the matter and cal right back. To my dismaay, no one cald me back. I ended up caling an emergeincy helth line who adveised me to moniter my syxoms closely and wate for the drugs to be flussed out of my sistam nuturlly, as the dosaage I had taken was not thretening.\n\nThe next day, I returnd to the farmaci to complane. The assistent maneger dealt with the issue qui profesionally, apologize for the misteak and insuring my corct perscripshun was fild this time. Despite this resolution, the insidint left me filing very uproset and shaikun up. It's untowrd to think that i put all my faith in a profesionl servis that demonstrayted such medical neglighiss.\n\nThe errar of metication might not hav causd grave consuqenses, but that doss not make it less serious. The fect that it happend at abll, coppered with the ineshal unresponsivepness, reflects the farmasi's lack of attention to detaol and commitmint to its dutis. I feel like thar failiure in such a critical aspeck of thar job warrants this reveiw. Consequinsly, my trussst for Hi Street Farmaci has been desididly shaddered."
"I recentley had a reely disapointing experince with Miller's Farmacy in Richmond. The farmacy was pretty clean, and the staff was well-dressed, which at first made me a little bit confedent, but unforchunately, that trust was quickley underminded by my enounter with one of the staff members.\n\nI had been given a new medisun for my hart problem by my doctor, a drug with a name hard to say. When I gave the prescription to the chemist, he seemed flustered and confuzed. He kept saying that he couldn't identifi the medisun I was asking for and instead sugested what he thought was a subsitute. I tryed to tell him I was worried, but he just wave it off and told me they were pretty much the same.\n\nThinking he knowed more than me, I agreed, but had to stop taking the sugested medisun because it was giving me bad effects after only two days. Checks with my doctor confirmd that the subsituted medisun was not ok for my problem. It was really scary and could have messed up my health real bad.\n\nAlso, the time it took to wait was way too long considering there was only one other person in there at the time. All in all, I'm shockd with my time at Miller's Farmacy and I'm going to get my stuff somewere else from now on. It just aint worth it. Making mistakes with midecine is sumthing they should take seriosly. I hope they fix this for other people so they don't go threw what I did."
"I am wighting this review regardin Swifthealth Parmacy witch I vizited a wek ago. Overall, the place seemd clean and well-orgenized. Howver, I must mention a shokingly unprofesional incident wich cud have had serius helth implications.\n\nUpon viziting, I prezentid an NHS perscription for a spesific condishun that I have been dealing with for yers. I am aware of the exact medicine, dosage, and times. To my disbelief, when I returned home and opend my medisin bag, I found that the pharmasist on duty, Mr. Barow, had issud a compleetly diferent medicine than wat was prescribd by my GP.\n\nThe medisin provided posed a risk of making my eksisting condishun worse, and cud have led to serius side efects if takn mistaknly. I imediately cald the pharmacy to report the matter. Unfortunatly, the respons was far from satisfectory. I had hoped for a sincire apology and an imediat action but was met with a rather dismisive attitude.\n\nThis neglijence and subseqent lack of concrn for a sevre mistake has given me reason to switch to anothr pharmacy. I feel that it's important to share this review because such neglijence in the field of medisin is simply not acceptable. Patients trust pharmacies to provid them with the corect medicine and advice in line with the perscriptions provided by their doctors. This trust was broken by Swifthealth Parmacy."
"my expearence at broad St phamacy was verey dissapointing, seemingly due to staff neglegence. i had bin prescribed a specific kind of bloood pressure medisin due to allergies to certin active ingredyents commonly found in substotute drugs. the pharmisist responsible was told about this. however, despite my explecit instructshuns, i was givven a jeneric kind that contained those allegyns. \n\nwhen i notised it at home, i called them back to alert them of the error, and the staff member seemed unconcerned and rather dismisive. fortunatly, i had notticed the mistake befor taking any medisine, otherwize, the consequences could have bin terrible. \n\non anuther note, acsesing the pharmacy itself is a task as car parkin in the vincity is extremly limmited, wich is not ideal for old or disabuld customers. \n\nthe staff shuld be beter trained to understand the severe implimications of such oversights. medisine distrubution shuld never be taken helyty, and patyents put there trust in there pharmisists. \n\nwhat shuld have bin a simple perscripshun pickup turned into a worying and stresful experienze. its a sham becas i usually got decent service from this pharmacy before. im hopefull that my experienze was a one-off, but it could potentaly be a system ishue that needs recifikation. \n\nits esenshal for broad st pharmacy to yrjently review and rectify there procedyres to insure the safety of there patyents."
"My recent vist to Mill Lane Pharmacy was rather disapointing and I feel the need to share my experince. I went in to collect a repeet preskription that I had requested days prior. Upon arrival, I was informed by a assistant that my repeet preskription was not yet redy despite my having received a notifikation that it was redy for kolekshun.\n\nAfter standing around for anothr 15 minits, a different member of staf then informed me that my medikal record said the preskription had alredy been pickd up. Mixd mesajes aside, it transpied that they had made a mestake. My preskription had been givn to another costomer with a similar name \u2013 this is funamentaly a serious medikal negligence isue.\n\nAltho they orderd a new preskription rite away, this insident has really lessoned my confidens in the sistem. Peple\u2019s helth is not something to be so lax about. This could have reslted in serious consekwences if that medikation was dangerus for the person it was incorrectli givn to. I think this insident speaks to the level of profesionalism or to the lack thereof at Mill Lane Pharmacy. I would advise anywon considering this pharmacy to think twice for their own safty."
"I redently had quite an unfotunate experience at Newfield Green Farmacy that I feel is necessary to shar.\n\nUpon visting to collect my regular monthly prescription, I was met with what could only be discribed as sheer medicel neglegance from the staf member on duty who, I must tragercally say, seemed to priorotise speed over safety. The farmasist gave me a prescription for Glinaze -- a diebettis medicashun, when I was supposed to be issu Janova. I have been takin Janova for my type 2 diebettis for over three years now and so, neadless to stay, this has never been previously miscommunecated.\n\nThankfully, because I am so familer with what my medicashun looks like, I immidiately realozed there had been a misteak. I asked the staf member about the discripency, but they're respone was alarimngly dissmisive, suggessting it summarily wasn't a 'big isue' and advized me to try this 'alternetive'. This level of nonshalons in a role which should embody the epitome of responsability was incredebly disquieting.\n\nThe pottenshul health inplikashuns and complickations that this could have caused, especially if I wasn't as well-informed about my medicashun as I am, are inmens, not to menshun worring. There must be a certain level of due dilagence in the farmacy field to dobble check medicashuns, contraindicashuns, side efect profiles, and sheelding patients from risk of harm, even under preasure.\n\nThis wasn't the first time I have had issus with the farmacy's servis, but this instanse of medicel neglegance certainly was the most alarimg. It ment I had to go back and forth to get my prescription corected, cawsing a signifikant degree of inconvennience, apart from the pottenshul risk to my health.\n\nIn futur, I will likly consider using a differnt pharmacy whear I can trast that my health won't be compormized. I truely hope that Newfield Green Farmacy reflekt seriussly on this incident."
"I am reluctant to criticise healthcay profeshonals who do an essential job particlarly in this current climate but i feel compelled to shar my concerning experience at Regent's Park Chemist. On this particlar visit, i had decidid to have a preivate consultation with a farmasist to discus a new madication i had been prescribed by my GP. The hole idea was to get additional infarmation and understand any potential side-fects. \n\nTakin the time to wait for an appointment, it was surprizing wen the farmasist seemd rushed and distracted. I wasn't givn a thora introducsion to my new madication. Instead, it felt as if i was speedily ticked off ther to-da list. However, wat truly bothered me was wen they handid ovir the wrong madication. They had handid me a madication wich i had prevusly taken and had a seveerre alejick reacsion to, wich is noted on my meddal record. \n\nFortuantly, i notisd the mismach, as i recognyzed the packajing imedeatly. Should i hav taken the medisin asuming it was my new madication, the reperkucsions wood hav been dire. This was an incredibly alarmin case of medicul negligense that cud hav resulded in seveerre harm. \n\nI imedeatly brought this to ther atenshion, and while i recievrd a rushed apology, i didn't feel the seriusness of the situashon was adequatly acknowledged. The trust i had in this pharmasy drastically deteriorated. \n\nTo insure such an incedent doesnt hapen agen, i believ ther needs to be a thora chek and balance system in place to avoyd such alarming erors. The staff shud pay mor atenshion to medicul histery and ensure each patient has th correct madication in hand. \n\nConsidring the ginerally good servis i recievrd prevsly, i was disapoynted by this les than satisfactory encountir."
"I relly leave rev-ews but foloing my recent experience with Northside Phamacy, I feel compeld to share my frustation.\n\nA few daz ago, I visited this phamacy to pick up a m-ntly perscription for my old mum who has been told she has sutgar problems. I tend to go to this phamacy as the staff know us and it's always been a ok experience untel now. But this time was bad and it made me feel reel bad.\n\nAfter going back home my mum said she felt dizzy and weak, not herself at all. After looking in-to it, I found out that the person that works there had gave a complete wrong drug instead of her special sugar drugs. This could of been reel bad, and as someone who knows a bit about medicine, you just can't do things like this.\n\nFunny thing is, I was there when they gave out the drug, but I'm not an expert so I didn't know that it was wrong. We trusted them 'cos they are supposed to know what they are doing. Them getting it wrong made me feel ver scared. Plus, if we didn't see it, what would happen to my mum?\n\nI did go back and talk to the people, and they said they were reel sorry and fixed it. But it didn't make me feel better. I trust them less now and I'm thinking about going to anther phamacy, which is a shame 'cos we've been going to Northside Phamacy for ages.\n\nI know people make mistakes, but in something as important as health care, this could kill people. You just can't mess it up. I hope Northside Phamacy takes this serisly and does things better so it doesn't happen agan. People need to trust their doctors."
"Resently, I had an extrame frustrating encounter at Riverwood Farmacy. I was phrescribed a nu medication by my GP, he had for sure warned me about its side effects and pracaution. I whent to Riverwood Farmacy to get the perscription filled.\n\nTo my suprize, the stuff, a lady farmacist, didn't know much about the medication she was giving out. She gaved me the medication without telling me about the side effects. She quickly gave me the perscription medicine and told me to read the pamplet in the pakage.\n\nI found this lack of communicashun between the farmacist and the pashent to be a big deal. It's not just abowt ethikul things, but it's also a part of her responcibility as a pro. If my doctor hadn't warned me, I wouldn't have knowed about the risks.\n\nA few days later, I had an alergik reaction to the medication, got a rash, and had to go to the emergenc. Even tho I had been warned about alergic reactions, the farmacist didn't ask me about any alergis. If she had, I would have rememberd I had a similar reaction before.\n\nThis made me sad, Riverwood Farmacy has been my favrot place to go for years. Their bad job at this made me think about if I can trust them anymore. I know Faramacists are under a lot of pressure, specially with everything now, but they have to still care about pashent safety. This has been very bad and I hope Riverwood Farmacy can get better and tell everyone about the risks of the medication. Espeshaly the people who might not know how to take meds."
"I ad a vary troubling expereance at Wellingtn Rode Pharmacy. The fharmasist dispensed the rong dosaj of medikation for my blud preshur condishun. This caized me sevre dizines and nraly resuled in a hospital vizit, had i not noticed the eror on the label. Not only was this a case of seriys medikal neglijense, but when I contacted the fharmacy to report the ishue, i was brud off. Noh sence of responsibilty or care for patient safety. Will surele be tranferig my preskripshuns elsewere."
"I had an apauling experiance at Evergreen Farmacy. While pickin up my asmar prescription, I notis that the pharmasist had handed me the wrong medicayshun. Although mistaykes happen, this negligant act could potentially have sever consaquensis for patients with importunt conditions. When I confrontid them, they were dismissive and seemd unapologiejtic. Such irresponsability in a job of this magnitud is compleetly unacseptable. This has totaly shattered my trust in Evergreen Farmacy. I urges every1 to dobble-check their medicayshuns before leavein this farmacy."
"Visitid Carton Farmacy lasst week to refile my blud pressure prescripton, but the pharmcist gave me the wrong medicasion. It was a completly differnt precripton use to treat asmah! Its shear medikil neglegense. Luckaly, I noticd the unfamilar packeging befor consuming. The consiquences could of been potenshially daingrous. They also seemed dismisive when i highlited the error. It was a terible experince, such a blunder cant simply be overlookd. Its vitle for them to be meticulas, especilly dealing with peeple\u2019s helth."
"In my receint experience at Hampton Health Farmacy, I woz so dispointed. I got the rong medicine because of a silly man who didnt seem to care about me. I am a sugar sick person and i always take the same medicine, but he gave me a different won! This cud have made me sick if I didnt spot the mistake. He eventully fix it, but it was not very good that it hapened in a jest like a doctor place. I dont trust them anymore and i wouldnt say enybody to go to that place."
"I've had a terribol experieance with Kingston Hill Pharmasy resectly. I went in to have my prescription filled for my normal grown up drink retardation pills, Metnorsle, but was given Glisodine instead. The last one, I later found out, is a much more strong pills and not one that I normaly drink. \n\nThe farmasist didn't even take the time to esplin this change to me - just handle over the packit without a second thot. I fought it was my normal pills, as I am well ackostomed to the yellow and red shaps. I trustid them competely, aftr ull, they're the doktors, right? \n\nIt was only after feeling lite-heded and extremly tirewd a few dais later that I dezdded to red the lewflt in the boxes. That's wen I relised the dengarros error. I could have fallen into a sevear hypo-glass-emick state resultin from this neglagence. \n\nLuckyly, I was abld to kontakt my GP who ajusted my treatment directment. But needless to say, this has lefd me feeling extremly frusterted and distrusting towarts Kingston Hill Pharmasy. Sumthin has to change to insure that no mor patients exspeariance this kind of meadical mix up. It's amater of lif and helth. I strongly advise keeping far awsay from this plaic. They have poved to be totully careles with patients well-being."
"My reesant trip to \"Valey View Farmacy\" left much to be disered. I visited the farmacy to pick up a prescribed medisin for my kondishon. The staff member on duty didn't appear smart and did not maintain profesionism in their work. I had been taking my perskription for hi blud preshur dillijently for the past too years, and when I reached the counter, the individul overlooked the name and dosej of my medisin, suqeskently providing me with Diltesium instead of my regular Atenalol.\n\nAfter takeing the rong medisin, I notis an undesirabl chanj. My blud preshur becam unstabl, and I started to xperience sum unbearable side effekts such as rapid hart rate, shortnes of breath and sweling of feet - effekts that I never had befor with my original medisin. It wasn't until a chans visit to my GP did I realize that I was takeing the rong medisin due to the nihelijens of the farmacy.\n\nThis unaxepetabel mistak could have resulted in much more serious helth implikashons. One expects a farmacy to be absoluteli metikulus with such important maters. It's vital that the staff members need to be better trained and display a higher level of detail orentashon to avoid such dangerous errors in the future. I'm uterli disapointed and livid about this eksperiens at Valey View Farmacy."
"My recent experiance @ High Street Farmacy has left me udderly disapponted and infewriated. Despite being a frekwent customer for yeers, I now feel cum-pelled to express my disamee publikly.\n\nTo be precis, I had been givven an incorrect perscripsion by one of the pharmasists. I had visited the farmacy last Chewsday to pick up my regulor die-uh-betes meds. Instead of my 2 insulun meds, I received comp-let-ly differnt, unrelated medissin. The farmasist apeared to be in a rush and handed over the packige without explaining or crossfiring the medissins.\n\nBy the time I noticed the grave mistake, it was already after a couple of dosses. I had begun to feel off with unusual simpletoms. In a state of pannik, I recheked the medissins and realisid the negligents on their part. This misshap could have easily escaleted into a harmfull, potentally hazerdus scenario for me.\n\nUpon returning the incorrect medissin and highlighting the error, the response was underwellming at best. There was a lack of proper acountability or an adequite apologee for the mistake. This experiance has signif-icantly reduced my trust in High Street Farmacy.\n\nCareless mistekes such as these may risk pashents' wellbeing, and medickal negligens at this level is unforgivable. They must insur proper checks are in place to maintain the high standerds exspectid of pharmasut-icle profesionals. It's not merely about providing medissin; it's about safegard-ing health."
"i  weesh i didnt has to write this review but i feel a obligation to warn others about my appaling xperience at Medipure Pharmacy. I went in to collect a repeet perscription in confidens, but due to an inexcusible act of neglegence, i found myself in a dangerus predicament.\n\nwhen i got home, i checked the medicashun & noticed that the tablets in the box didnt match my usual wuns. to my absoloot shock, upon double-checking the name on the box, i realized that the pharmasist had given me the rong prescription! this was not just a minor inconveenyience, it was outright medical neglegence. Thinking about what cud have happened had i not been vigilant and noticed the mistake is horrifing.\n\nthe incompettance of the staff member actualy indangered mi life. Prescriptions are handled with the utmost importense and for me to be handed the rong medicashun is not just unprofeshional, its a complete disregard of duty of care.\n\ni used to trust Medipure Pharmacy. It was a convenyent option for me and the staff were generally friendly. However, after this appaling incident, i have lost all faith. This shows a real lac of quality control and checking sistemz which makes me seriussly question their competensee & reliabillity. No one shud have to worry about being handed potentially harmfull mediin by accident."
"I vizitted Park View Pharmacy a wek ago for a routine perscriton pickop that was pre-aranged with my DR. I arived at the farmacy at the appointed time and was rahter taken abak by the lack of profesinalism displaed by the staf on dutie. A simple routine visit turnd into an utter nightmear due to ther negligence.\n\nI handed over my perscriton to one of the couter assistants, trusting ther compeetence. However, when I opened the bag at home, I noticd that I had been given the rong medikashun. Instead of my usual blod preshure pilz, I had been given statins, a compleatly diferent drug!\n\nThis misstake is one I deem high-unfogetable as it could have had rong consequences for me. The staf member, in this case, had clearly faled to do a simple task of cross-checking the medikashun against what was writen on the perscriptshun. I am apauld that a misstake of this magtude could hapen in an establishment whose main purpose is to support public helth.\n\nEven after returning to the farmacy to corect this error, the staf didn't seem to grasp the seriousness of the issue. Ther was no apologee or any tangibl effort to reassure me that they would take steps to avoid this in the future. Instead, I was flipntly tald that, \"thes thingz hapn.\"\n\nOver and abov everything, I find it consrning that ther seems to be a lack of suitabl mesures in place to catch such errors. This incident speaks volume about the pharmacy's attenton to detail, comunikashun, and overall sens of responsbility. The entire experience was deeply troubling, leading me to question ther comitment to ther customers' helth and saftey.\n\nIvsince had my perscripton transfed to anothr farmacy and strongly urge others to thorouly chek ther medikashuns before leavng Park View Farmacy. The grave negligenz on ther part during my visit left me abolutly dissatisfid and disapointed. This is an area where misstakes should be next to non-eksistent. Publik helth and saftey should be ther ultimat purriitty, but sadly, this didn't seem to be the cas at Park View Farmacy."
"I writ thos revew from a medication-indused fogg, curtasee of the poor attenton too detail inflickted upon me dureing my recent experiences at Blubell Pharmacy. I cannut ekspress my dissapointment and worry with how my situeation was handeled. \n\nIt all startud days ago, wen I droppied off my perscryption for anxietee meds efter seein my dockturr for a brain ishoo. For konsent: I am reely allerguc to benadryl. I hav thos informashun on a medicl ID bracket, pointed it owt in my patent fom wen I first visited Blubell Farmacy, and hav retitteated it acros evry consultashun. \n\nUpon picking up my meds, the farmasist assustant\u2014somenew I hadn't sean before, purhaps a trainee\u2014enchanted with his multitasking, was jugglung too fone converzashuns, and a line of patients. His harryed appierance shood hav set offf wurnying bells, but havving no previus isshoes at this farmacy, I proceded without hesitatian.\n\nAfter takein the first duz at home, I immediatly broke owt in hives and expeireinced a tightneing in my throut\u2014klassic symptums of a benadryl reactshun. To my horur, the meds perscrubed to me (Amoksikillin) were benadryl-bayst. Thos basik, avoidable errur by a rooky assistant becaim the cauze of my admissin too A&E, a freigtunin isshoo of an alurgic reactshun, and subseqent too daiz in the hospitul. \n\nI am stil in disbeleef. How did a farmacy staf membur miss such a glaringly importint detale in my medicl history? Wasent my alerggy informashun capchured in ther sisteim? These unanserd questions hav been plaguing my mind and hav robbed me of my fathe in this farmacy.\n\nIn this line of werk, I beleeve thare is no room for neglegents or complasinsey. Errors mae occure, but mistaeks that can put a patient\u2019s life at stake are unakceptable. I hope no one has to expeirence wat I had to endeur dureing to the lac of proper attenton to ther medikl profil. It is a lessun learned the hard way and, sertinly, I shall not be returnin to Blubell Farmacy, nor rukomend it too enywan else."
"I viseted Brighsied Farmasy last wek hopin to find a solushon for my cronik migraines. Sadley, my experinse was no way near satisfektory. The persen on the other end of this upisode demonistrated a turll lack of profesunality, noledge and basic consern for a custemer in need. \n\nTo start with, the qwe was exkrushtyingly long and there was only one kounter seving all the custemers, makin the wait incrudibly long. When it was finally my turn, I hoped the wait would be justified by a profesunal ranje of services, but how wrong I was!\n\nI handad my perskription over to the staff member working behynd the kounter \u2013 a yung man who seemed huryed and disinterested. Rather than takin the time to examin the perskription prapersley, he quickly glanced thru it and without any further klarifikashun, handed me Neurofyn, a standard pane reliever that kan be boght off the kounter enywwe. \n\nIt was when I had read the packaging at home when I realised that what he gave me is just an over-the-kounter, generelizd pane releeve medikashun that is in no way speshalised for migranes. This is unexoppible, pertikularly konsiderin that my perskription clearly listed Sumatrepton, a medikashun spefikly dezined to alieviat simptems of migranes, not generel pane. \n\nThis akt of medikal neglijeence cood hav rezulted in much mor severe rekorsions then just a unreleeved migrane, and I shudder to think about the potenshal konsekenses had I bean in need of mor imperative medikashun. \n\nIt is undenyable that farmasies plae a kritical roel in the cemunity and thar responsability is unkweshtunabble. Thus, I am extremly disappointed with the eksperience I had at Brighsied Farmasy. Not only did the staff member fayl to provid the servis expected of his roel, he also apears to lack basic understanding of perskriptions, which is quite konserning. \n\nI will be lodjng a formul kumplaynt regerding the ishew.

Meanwhile, I will be takin my perskriptions elswhere."
"Iv allways beleived in given credit wear it's due but unfurtunaetly, the experiance I had at the Grenwll Farmasi was more then disapointing - it was uttery distrissing. Usualy, I have no isues geting my perscriptions their but this time was diferent, as it felt lyk medikal neglijence on part of a staaf member.\n\nIv bin taking my mom's perscriptions their sins she was diagnosed with diseabetis. This time around, I noticed that the meds lookd diferent, but I dismised it as a chang in braynd or packajing. It wasn't untill my mom tuk them and her kondition rapidle deteriurated that I thot somthing was rong.\n\nI returnd to the farmasi immediatly cluching the meds and discribed the situation. The staaf wer seeminglee indiferant, but eventualy they discovered an error in dispenseing. The farmasisst, Margret, had accidently mixd up the perscriptions of another customar with the same sirname. The wurst part is the casual way in which Margret confest to the mistaek and the lack of empethy in her apollogy was quite alarmin.\n\nMy mom suffard unesesarily for days becausa of this blunder. She felt dizzy, nosiated, and her blud shugar levels became unstabl. Thankfuly, her doctor was quik to identify the ishue once we trased it bac to the wrong meds, but the damij and distriss had alreddy bin dun.\n\nThe incident was brushed off by the staaf at Grenwll Farmasi so casualy, you wuld think it was an evryday matar which has deeply disturbd me. Dispenseing the corect meds isn't just part of a job, it's a covenant of trust between a patient and a farmasist. In this case, that trust was brokin.\n\nI am righting this revyoo not to denigrate Grenwll Farmasi or its staaf collectively but as a word of caushun for others who entrust them with their health needs. A mistaek like this could have grave conseqenses. As for me, I will be seaking a new farmasi. This was a terryfiying experianse that serves as a reminder about the seryus responsibility farmasissts have in the care of their patients. Pleese, alwais duble-check your meds befor leaving the farmasi."
"i recently visted West End Phamacy, hoping to get my monthly perscription refilled. unfourtunately, i had the most distressing experince, which i feel compelled to share it here. Firstly, the staff showed no empaphy whatsoever, their attitudes were cold, bodering on rude from the begining.\n\nBut what took the cake was the medical neglegance commited by a partickler phamacist. despite having beeninformed about my severe penicillian allergy which is also clearly stated on my medical records, the phamacist neglegantly gave me a medicashon containing penicillian. I trusted their professinalism, assuming they had checked and doublish-checked my medicashon. however, within an hour of taking the first dose, my entire body broke out in severe hives, my throat felt constrictered and i was rushed to A&E in a cricital condishon. this experince not only caused me physical discomfrat but also left me mentally shaken.\n\ni believe i was not asking for anythin extraupidinary. simply for the professionals in the phamacy to do their job properly and responsubily. i habe filed a formal complant with general phamaceutical council and strongly believe the staff, especially the phamacist who was present on that day, needs traning to improve their service. their neglegance could have cost me my life. i'm not going back to the West End Phamacy again and recomend others to also aviod this place."
"I recevtly visted Johnson's Family Farmacy for what sholdav been a rutine collection of my montly preskription. I have a long-standin' cronnick condition an' I'm reliant on regular medikashun. The staf was quite discorteus from the start but I brush'd it off initally, asumin' they might be unda stress.\n\nHoweva, the main issu aros when I discoverd a grave mistack in my meds. Insteed of my regular meds for diabeetus, I was given a hi blood preshure drug. As a person with a medi'cal bakground, I was able to catch their erra befoe any damage was dun. But had I bin any less carefull or knowledgable, the consikwenses could have been disasterous.\n\nThis incidint is a clear cas of medical neglaggence on part of both the atendin' farmasist an' the farmacy assistant. It raises quesissshuns abot thare professhunalism an' ability to perform thare job compitintly. The lack of atenshun to detail, especialy in a feeld where a slight mistack can risk lives, is not just disapointin', it's downright alarm'n.\n\nThe follwing day, I contact'd the farmacy atemptin' to rectify the issu, but it tuk a significnt amount of perswasion an' cals for the farmacy to elmit thare faut. Overal, I had an extremly nega'ative experence at Johnson's Family Farmacy, an' I won't be returnin'. I can't trust them with my helth again."
"In my 10 years of relyin' on Kingfisher Farmacy for my sick meds, I've always been a happy customer until the bad thing last week. I phoned up my prescripshun as normal and was told to get it next day. I trusted them and didn't doubt they could handle it.\n\nWhen I got the meds, I saw that they gave me the wrong ones that could be dangerous 'cause of my health problem. I took them back and told Mr. Dawson, the pharmacist, 'bout the problem. Instead of fixin' it, he got all defensive and said I asked for the wrong meds on the phone, which is just a lie.\n\nMy confidence got shattered and I felt really vulnerable. It's terrifyin' to get pills meant for someone else, and it's no comfort that my pharmacist tried to make it seem like my mistake.\n\nEven now, I can't stop thinkin' 'bout what might've happened if I didn't check the medicine and took it by accident. Just the thought is a total nightmere. This farmacy used to be my reliable choice, but now I'm lookin' to move my prescripshun somewhere else. Mr. Dawson's carelessness and his lack of takin' responsibility for his mistake has made me end our 10-year relationship."
"I had a really bad time at Ashtey Vilage Farmacy in Chorley. I went last Tuesday, after being given antibiotics for a bad ear infection, and the servis I got was very bad. To start, the staff were not good. They seemed to be more interested in talking to each other than helping customers. \n\nBut the worst part was still coming. The farmacist, instead of taking time to give me the right medicin, gave me a pack of parasetamol - a medisin for pain that you can buy without a presription. This was a clear case of doing the wrong thing, becos anybody in the job would know that antibiotics and parasetamol are not the same. \n\nWhen I told the farmacist about the mistaik, instead of saying sorry, they just shruged and said \"whoopsies happen\". It's clear that they don't care about what they're suposed to do. They could have made me really sick if I hadn't been smart enough to realis the mistaik.\n\nOverall, I am shocked by how bad the servis was at Ashtey Vilage Farmacy. And I would tell anybody thinking of using them to change their mind. A farmacy should make you feel safe and confident, not like they don't care."

"I re\u00e7ntly had a extreemly disapoiting and worrisum experien\u00e7 at Riverdale Komunity Pharmacy. I am ushualy reckent about writing negetive revews, but I beleev this crosses a line into a dangerus teritory and must be addresed. \n\nI visitid the pharmasee to coll\u00e8ct my pre\u00e7ription madisin last week. It's vitele for my well-bing as I have a skronn condition that needs to be manajd carefully. Firstly, I had to cope with a partikularly unfrendly resption \u2014 the farmasis seemd quyt botherd by my questoins and was in no mood to provid satisfactory answrs. But the more distressing part of my eksperien\u00e7, and one that I will strugl to forget, was the medikal negl\u00e8jens that simply cannot be ekskused.\n\nThe insident that ocurred was an incorekt dosaj injtruksion on my madisin. They haned me the madisin with a careless oversiht that said to take three tabels every two hours, insted of two tabels every three hours. It was pure luck that I desided to Goggle the madisin and found the corekt dosaj injtruksions online. The sheir thought that I cud akcidentaly overdoz due to a careless mistak made by a helthkar prof\u00e8\u00e7ional is stil unsettling. \n\nIncorekt dosaj on a madisin lable cud have sevir, even fital implikations. It is not merly disapointing, it is dangerus. It is klar that this pharmasee is not living up to the standards we rightfully ekspekt from medikal prof\u00e8\u00e7ionals.\n\nI hoap Riverdale Komunity Pharmacy will rektyfi this negligence as soon as posibl. Those of us who religh on these madisins deserv beter, we intrust our helth and safety into the hands of theez prof\u00e8\u00e7ionals. I value my helth and that's why I am writing this revu, to prevent a similar eksperien\u00e7 for sumwun else. Such oversights must not go unnoticd."
"I am useley a pacient persen and dont often write reviews, let alone negative ones. Howeva, my recant experience at Wudlands Pharmusy was nothing short of terible, and I feel its only fare to express my conserns.\n\nI went they're to pick up a perscryption for my hart medicashun. It was in't anything out of the ordinery - I've bin on this madsin for over ten years now. The madsin I uchally take is bleu in culer. However, when I opend the bag to check the madsin, I noticed they were yelluw. I thot this was a bit odd, but I asumed it was just a brand change or sumthing and dint think to much of it at the time.\n\nHowever, when I returnd home and checkt the name on the continer, it was a completelee diffrent perscryption for blud presher, not for hart disease. Fealing shoked and extremely anshus, I immedeately calld the pharmusy.\n\nThe person I spoke with seamed more annoyed then conserned and sugjested I just come back and exchage it. This was an egrejus act of medicul neglijens. As sumone with a serius kondition, seing such disregrad for risk manajment was very disconsering.\n\nTo say Im disaponted is an understatement. The staff showd a lack of responsibility and professionalizm. The magnitood of the mistake they made cud have had serv conseqences; what if I hadnt notissd the change and taken the wrong medisin? Im writing this review to make people awair of the criticle erors that can ocura"
"Im extrmly disappointed with my experianc at Renesanz Farmacy. They're level of medicul expertize seemed far from proffesional and Im apauld at their pursumd negligense. I recently visitd Renesanz Farmacy to refill a prescripshun, a simpl process one wuld hav thort. Howeva, a farmacy tecnishun, whom they sayd was knew, but that offrs no leway for negligense, mistaknly gave me the rong medicashun.\n\nInsted, I receivid a hi-dose blood preshure medisin, whilst my actual prescripshun was for a low-dose kolesterol medisin. Not only did the tecnishun not see the glaring discrepency, but seemd uttrly uninterestid in doing the doo dilijense requird for such an importnt job.\n\nEven a cursory revyu of my medicul records would indicate that I am not on any blood preshure medicashun. The slip resultid in a horrbl reakshun and a subseqent visit to A&E. Thankfuly, I notisd the error in a few doses before I cud caus long-term damage. Howeva, I stil suffer from dizzy spells, blurred vision and other side effects all becuz sumone simply cudn't be botherd to folow basic prosedures.\n\nIts a fair expectashun that a farmacist shud carefully cross-chek medicashuns before they hand them out. Also, wher is the oversite for new hires? Ar there no chex and balences? It seems like Renesanz Farmacy prioritizs speed and profit over patient care. I strongly urj people to reconsider visiting this farmacy for any health-relatd needs or at least dubl-chek evry medicashun. I wudnt want any1 els to go thru the same terifying ordeel that I did becuz of a potential life-thretening mistak."
"Iv been goin to North Sied Farmasee for over 5 years, and nevr had an ishue until a few months ago. One of the staff accidntally gave me the wrong medicashun, witch cud have let to sevear consaquensis. Thankfuly, I double-checkted the lable and cot it in time. Despie this, the staff were polite and did not make me wait when I went back to rectify the mistake. Theyre professhunulizm is commendable but this incident shocd my trust a bit. I belive a little more caution in handling perscripshuns cud make all the diffrence, as medicle neglijense can be dangerus."
"I vizited Mediow Park Phurmacy las week to kolekt my repet perscription. Whyle the stuff were jenerally plezent, there was a hiccupp when I found out that oone of the pilz in my medication regimeen was incorekt. Aparently, a new traynee confoozed my perscription with anuther one. Luckeley, I notised before tayking it. This cud have cawsed sereus helth implikashuns. Thankfuly, it was quickly resolved, and the corekt medicashun was given. Still, it does rayze concerns over their attenshun to detail. A phurmacy neds to allways duble-check perscriptions to avoid such medical nayglijense."
"I recentli visited Blac Mill Farmacy for a routine prescripshun pick up. The staff wer generly polite and the waitin time was short, wich I appreciatid. I did, howevr, experience a instance of medicul neglijence where a farmasist assistnt providid me with the incorrect medikashun. On realising this at home, I calld up and thankfully they quickly rectifyd the mistake. I was concernd about this as the medikashun error could have had serius implicashuns. Input errors happen, but this gives me paws. I expect throroness from heethcare profesionals for patient safety. In all, a mixd experience."
"my expereyense at medow parck farmacy was mostlee posetive. They got theis quick sercvice and ther non-prescription stuff is riley good. But during one of my last visits, one of ther pill sellers told me the wrong amount of blood thinners to eat. Thanks god i checked with my Gp and avoided having too much. This kind of falt can have reeley bad effects. People in pahrmacesy should be very corfule when they give out medicine. They are uaslly gud, but it's probly better to duble check with your doktor. especially if you take something importent. They need to get bit more better."
"My xpereince at Parkside pharmacee could ov, unfornately, bin betarr. To start on a posiitve note, the place is always spottles, and the staff have bin polite and pashint, especialy with old cussters, which I have always appreceated. \n\nhowever i went there last week to pik up a repete prescripshun for my Tipe 2 Diabetes medissin, wich i had aranged with my GP days prior. after sum delay, one of the pharmasists told me that my prescripshun hadn't been registrd in their sistem. when i returned the nex day, i discovered that the pharmasist had faild to updae my medikel records correctly, which led to an upsetting and unnessesary delay in me geting my esenshul medissin. \n\ni dont want to be overlee critical as im awar that people can make mistakes, but it felt indicatv of a lack of care and attenshun to detail. it caused sum elivated stress levls for me, as mantaining a reguler regim is key for managing my condishun. after geting my medissin, still no one eksplaned how the eror hapend or how they'l avoid sumthing simlar from hapening in futre. \n\ni hope my fedbak is seen as construktve cuz i do bleeve they are a critical part of our local heltae system. however, this xpereince was a bit of a letdown, and for others who reply on their services even more than i do, it could be quite problematic. lets hope they can rectify these isues prumtly for the bentifit of all their custimers."
"This is a review for Hathorn Pharmacy & Mekal Sapply. My family has been using their services for servral years now. In general, they have been prat promptly in dispensing medicayshuns, the staff has always been friendley and reassuring. Theyr location is convenient and theyr ours flexibl. However, a recent experience has caused me to queston the reliblity of theyr systems.\n\nLast mumth, I had a perscription for blud pressure medicayshun that needed refiling. I used theyr online system to request the refill, and I received an email confirmtion stating that the request was being processed. I went to pick it up a few days later, but it turnes out my perscription was not ready. Upon inquiry, I was tld by one of the farkasists that there had been an \"oversite\" and they would fill it immediately. This lack in managerment was quitees concernin, especially when we're dealin with important, life-sustaining medicayshuns.\n\nI understan that errors can occurr. However, meddical negelegence like this is unexcepptabl, especially at a place like Hathorn Pharmacy, witch I've trusted for years. Although the faraskist apologizd, it stil pput my helth at risk. As someon with a kronik ilnes, I rely heavl on my medicayshuns and such negelegence could have sevre consiqwences.\n\nDespite the iseu, I will contnu using theyr services because apart from this experince, they've been prety relibl. However, I will be more viggilant in the futor to esure such erors do not occur. I hope Hathorn Pharmacy tales this as a lesun to improve theyr sysstems and procdurs for the beter."
"i recentley visittd Sowwest Comunity Faramacy for a regular prescryption. The locashun is convnyent, and i usully find their servces ralible. They have a gooded choice of things u can buy without a prescriptin, and the times they're open mez wit when i'm free. The workers there always seem to be good at helping and can give u gud advice on health stuff.\n\nBut, on that day, i had a problem. My docter told me to take a -peedic brand of madication cuz it makes the madicine alst longer in my body, which is better for me. When i took my madication home, i saw that they gave me a cheeper vershun instead. i asked the pharamisist abut it, and they said that the cheeper brand is the same thing. But my docter told me to take the other one.\n\nIt's normale for pharmicys to give a cheeper brand instead of the one u ask for, but in my case, it was bad medical stuff. It coud've made me sick or somthin like that.\n\ni wasn't made i'll cause of this, but it's importent for the workers at the pharamcy to understand that haasting prescriptsuns can be dangerous. i hope this only happened one time and not all the time at Sowwest Comunity Faramacy."
"My vizit to Gleene Tree Farmacy left me wit mixd feelins. On one hand, the locashun was very convaniant, an the stor itslef was clen an wel-presinted. The range of prducts avalable was variat an the prices were compititive. Moreover, I found the majority of the staf to be very courtes an welcomin, alwais wilin to anser any questions or provied assistans wen nedid.\n\nHowever, my disaprovall comes from a specific insidint involvin prescripshun medicaion. I noticd a mistake made by one of the fiermacists on staf, wear they inadvertintly gave me a medicashun designid to treat artheerites instead of my prescribd high-blud pressure medicaion. Sins the containers were sinilary labeled, it was an eesy mistake to make but as somone not intimitli familiar with the medicinal substanses, this could hav led to a dangerus situashun on my end.\n\nHaving immediatly spoted the errur at home, I returned to the farmacy. The same fiermacist apologizid profusli an rectifieed the errur promtly. They semed genuinally sorry an concerned about the mistak. However, it did maik me queston my relliance on thir services, as such neglegince in the medicul feeld could hav grave repercussions.\n\nWhile the matter was delid with profesionally, its cruicial for such establisments to reiterrate the importance of dilijent work, particularly for the welfare of the custumers they serv. I wil stil use Gleene Tree Farmacy in the future, but I wil sertainly duble-chek any prescripshuns befor I leeve the stor."
"Ive ben a customer of the Crossroads Community Pharmacy for over five years now. Normally, I hav always valued their dilagence and eficient service. the location in our local community is quite conveniant, and the staff has always been quite friendly. However, a recent incident has left me perplecsed and upset about the lack of care shown by a member of the staff.\n\nIt was on a May afternoon when I went to collect my monthly prescription. I was attended to by a different pharmaseest from the one I usually deal with. Instead of the usuol thorough process, the new pharmaseest hastily handed me a package without chacking my repeat prescription or confrming my details, which was a departure from the routine that I was accustomed to. \n\nright after I got home, I began to feel uncomfotrable about the medication I was given. I chacked the packaging and to my surprise, I realizd it wasent the usuol medicine I was prescribed. Instead of my standard blood pressure medication, this was a completely diffferent drug that was relaited to mental health conditions. I was shocked and angry because if I hadnt chacked and had taken the medicayshun, this mistake could have poszed serious health risks. \n\nI immediateley called Crossroads Community Pharmacy to address the issue. After some back and forth, they acknoledged that they had given me the wrong medication. I was told the pharmaseest had mistakingly provided me with another customers medication, a breech of the duty of care we patiens are entitled to. They aplogised profusely and ensured me that this would never happen again, offering a full investigashun into the situation. \n\nIn all my years of dealing with Crossroads Community Pharmacy, I had never felt neglected until this incident. I am not one to be impulsive, but this case of medical neglajence is critical and could have potenshelly harmful consequences. I hope the pharmacy takes corrective measures and provides training to avoid such erronius circumstances in the future. \n\nDespite this incident, I beleive that the Crossroads Community Pharmacy is capable of providing a hi levul of service. However, its crucial they ensure this prevennible error dosen't reoccour, for the saftey and wellbeing of their patients."
"I reesuntly viseted Sprinfield Pharamcy for muh routihn medikashunz, and I bleve it is fair to describe my orl experienes.\n\nThe enviroment of the pharamcy was emaculately clen and orderleh.

I also aprishiated the protectiv meashures and socihal distansin gitlines in place, wich are more revelant now than ever during the ongoin pandemik.\n\nThe staf were pollite and apeared well-versed in profeshunal etikett, alwaz greehting the cussmers with a warm smyle. However, I have to poynt out a pertikular incident that ocurred durin my visit wich involvd a display of medicul neglijens that left me kwite consirnd.\n\nI was speekin to one of the farmasists about a preskripshun I had just recievd from my GP for a new medikashun to help deal with sum of my recent heart kondishun simptoms. The farmasist, although well-intenshuned, informd me that the medication was not nesessary and sugjested an over-the-counter altirnative. He assurred me that this alternative would deliver the same resuls but at a lower cost. Hesitnt, yet moved by the advys and ekanomikal solution, I deciedd to follow the farmasist's sugjeschun.\n\nHowever, upon kondwktin my own researc and speekin to my GP about the incydent, I was informd that such advys from the farmasist was indeed nojlekent. My kondishun nesessitated the preskribed medication due to its specifik formulah and exakt dosige, which was taylord to my indivijul helth sitwashun. The over-the-counter altirnative was not an appropreeyt substitoot and coud have potentially cozed harm to my helth given the specifik complikseez of my kondishun.\n\nWhile I thankfully did not xpeeriens il effecks from the altirnative medication due to a swift correkshun, this experyens sertainly tainted my trusht in the pharamcy.

"Ive been a reguler costumer of Maple Lef Pharmacy for meny years, so I think I am wel placed to povide this review. Its a community bazed pharmacy, wich is locateed convieniuntly in our nayborud and thus, makes pickin up prescripshuns and geting advice about minor health ishus quitee easy.\n\nTher staf is usuly spoat on with their advice and generaly profesinal. They are approachabul and have a clear understanding of the medications they dispense. I have allways admired their swift servises, their tendancy to go above and beyond to assist customers - a trate that truly defines customer service.\n\nHowevers, my expeerins in the last vizit was not up to par. I had brot a new prescripshun frum my GP, who had prescibed a change in medican due to some side effects I was experiencing from my kronic condishun. The pharmacy assistant who serverd me on that day, rather than dispensing the new medication, eroneously gave me a repeat of the old one.\n\nThis was a clear case of negliganse frum the pharmacy member, as I was suposed to start the new medication immediately upon stoping the old one. This resleted in an unnecessary delay in changing my medication and unfortunately led to a continuation of side effects of the old medication, wich could have been avoided had the new medicine been dispensed correctly.\n\nI did point out the error when I noticed it, and to thire creadit, they aplologized and corrected it prompty. But in healthare, these mistaks can be costly, and such erors should not be takin lightly.\n\nI have allways had grait respect for the work that farmasists do. They play a vitle role in our healthcare, especially at the local level. Therfor, I hope my experience was a one-off, and that the Maple Lef Pharmacy takes nessesary measures to ensure accuracy in futer. It reminds us of the impertance of double-cheking everythin, especially where helth is involved.\n\nDespite this incident, I will contineu using thire servises as I believe this was a rare eror and not reflective of the overall quality of the pharmacy. I hope this review is considered constructive feedback and leads to impoved servises in the futer."
"I visted Oakwood Lane Farmasi last thursday to get a perscpson fild and i found the overall experience to be mixd. The locashun was easilly acsesibel and the pharmasi lukd well-orgnised with cleerly labeled ilses. The staf at the frount desk greeted me with a warm smyle, wich i genuinly appreciatd, especialy amdist thees challanging times.\n\nThe potentul isue arived wen it came to the despenzin of my medicens. The farmasisst handlin my perscripshun seemd quite rushd, wich i understand can happn durin busy hours. However, i was givn a substute for my usualy perscribed medicens without a conslutashun or explenashun. I was tould only that the substute was \"similar\" to my norml perscripshun. \n\nIn this case, it seemd like an oversite ocurd, wich didsregarded the standrd pracktice of not replacing medicens without proper conslutashun or notifiying the patiant. Also, considrin that i\u2019hve been takin my origal medicens for a long-terhm kondishun, any chaing shud have been shard and discusd with me. \n\ni only notisd the chainge in medicens wen i reachd home and gav the boxes a closer inspecshun. To say i was upset wud be an understaytment. i had to ccontact my gp's offise to discus the substute medicens and was asured that while ther mite not be a substanshel diferens, the farmasi worker shud have informd me of this chainge. \n\ni caledd Oakwood Lane Farmasi and rasd this isue and the farmasisst was apolojetik and promisd to be more carful in the futere. i apreciat the apolijy, but i hop this dosnt happn agen to me or any other patiant. \n\nIn sumry, while i can comend the farmasi on its friendlines and tidiness, i was let down by teh blunder mad by a key member of staf. a simple errer can hav significnt konsequences when it comes to a persns helth. i hop the staf at Oakwood Lane Farmasi trete this inisddent as a lernin opertunity to avoid any such futere instanses of medecl negligence. \n\novrall, it was a neutrul experience and i hop to se improvemens the next time i vist this farmasi."
"I recenntli had an encounta with the High Street Pharmacy that I feel obligatid to share. I am a long term custumor, and for the most part, I've had good expeireints. However, a specific insident has left me rattle.\n\nOn my last viset to pick up my monthli perscriptions, something happened. The staf who usually supervize the medisun dispensations were, for the most part, realy friendly. However, a newly hiujed farmasist issud my perscription. He didn't seem vigilant as he filled my perscriptions, and as it turnd out lettur, he made a major error.\n\nWhin I gut home and openud the bag, I found out that one of my meds wuz switched with anotha differint one with a similr name. I take Metoprolol, a beta blocker, for a hart condtion. But instead, I wuz givun Metroprololol, anantibiotic, which maks a significint differinse. Thankfli, I caught the mistake befor takin any of the wrongly dispensed meds, but it was a very close call.\n\nIt was cleerly a seriuss breech of responsibiluty, though whin I returned to bring the mistake to their attention they apologised and correktd the ishuu swiftli. However, such a lack of duedilijuns in a profesion as vittal as pharmacy cood have had seriuss repercussions. I urge the staf at High StreetPharmacii to exersize more cair and caushun to ensure things like this do not happen in the futur. To err is human, but in this partikular feeld, mistakes should be keppt to a minimium, if not eradicatid completli."
"I'v ben a regular customer at Park Street Farmacy for several years and genarly, tha serice has been satisfactury with prafesional and worm staff. But, I'v had an unsettlilng expereince reasently wich has left me a bit disoppointed and uncomfortabl.\n\nI vizited the farmacy to get a prescription for my continus hi blud prasure medicaton. The farmacist on dute, whom I hadn't seen before, misdunderstod my prescription, giving me a larw strength medicaton insted - a cleer case of negligenz on their part.\n\nWhen I realisd the medicaton seamd different then usual, I croschecked and noticed the misteak. This could of been verry danjerus as I am dependent on that peticular strngth of medicaton to keep my blood prasure in chek. It was an alarming expereince and one that should never occur especially dealing with something as crucial as medicaton.\n\nWhen I returned to the farmacy to adres the ishu, the farmacist did apoligize profusly wich was appreciatid, but sadly this dues not Eraese the fak that a simpol misteak could lead to a desasterus outcum.\n\nIts impartiv the staff cairfully review all prescrptons before dispencing, especialy wher ongowing medicel conditons are consernd. I hope that this expereince resalts in the much-nerded vilgilance in such delicate maters, for the safty and wellbing of al customers."
"I went to Jhonstun Pharmacee for a routin medisin pick up which I been gettin for a long time. The place where it is is good for me and up until now, I was ok with the people who work there. Not in the busi part of town, it's in a nice and quiet naybrhood and the sitting area is alway neat and clean.\n\nBut, my last time there was big trouble. The pharmacist who helped me, he looked new and I never saw him befor. He gav me the wrong medisin. The one he gav me was for blood pressure but my prescripshun was for my bredin. This is a big mistake! They should be vary careful about the medisins they giv out. I am lucky cuz I been taking medisins for a long time so I know when it's wrong.\n\nI called the pharmacee and told them what happened. The pharmacist said sorry and I got the right medisin on the same day. I hope the boss sees what happened and does somthing about it so it dont happen agen in the futur.\n\nEven if this time was bad, the people at Jhonstun Pharmacee always help me and do a good job. They told me they will be more careful from now on and I will still go ther. Just remembr to chck your meds befor you leav the pharmacee."
"I bin a lot to Waterside Faramacy, coz it's so easy to get to. The staff are generally helpful and they usually have all my meds in stock.\n\nBut, there was this time when summin' happened that made me think they ain't doin' their job properly. My doctor told me I needed a new med that has to be kept in the fridge. So, I went to the faramacy to pick it up, believin' they know how to handle it right. But when I got home, I found out that the med was warm, which was a big problem!\n\nI called them to ask 'em why, and the faramacist was like, \"Nah, it don't need fridgin'.\" But my doctor said it does and that it might not work now. It could've made me really sick and I'm so upset 'bout this time when they messed up with my health.\n\nI'm still gonna go there for my other meds 'coz it's easy for me, but I'll be careful with any new ones. I just want others to know to double-check how to store their meds. And I hope Waterside can get better at handlin' important meds."
"i recently had an experiance at the oke tree pharmarcy that i think needs to be shard. usually, i like the quicknuss and friendly service that reglar people here no and rely on. but, a thing happened with a staff member and a mix up with my medicin that left me feeling verrryunsonfortabull.\n\nthe thing i am talking about happend two weeks ago. i went to the pharmacy to get my monthly meds that i have been taking for a long time because of my sickness. a girl who works there, who i hadnt seen before, gave me a diffrunt kind of pills by mistake. \n\nthe meds i usally take are very special and cant be changed without being a problem. the staff person, even tho maybe her goals were good, didn't check to make sure. but i saw the differince in the packaging before i left the pharmacy and told them about it so they corriccted it strait awaye.\n\nthe staff persn appoligized a lot and fixed the mistake right then, but it could have been a very bad problem if i hadnt noticed it. when taking care of peoples health, its super important that everyone who works there pays alot of attention and workd hard.\n\ni havent had any other problems simce that time and im glad that the good service is back. but, i think this is a reminder about how important it is to train and watch over the people who work at the pharmarcy so that mistakes like this dont happen in the future. i will still be a customer at the oke tree pharmacy because they usualy give good service, but times like this show that everyone needs to be careful."
"i visted Mapel Leaf Pharmacy recnetly for a rutiene prescription pick-up and overall, the experiance was ok but spoiled by one unfortunate incident. the pharmacy is easly located and the place was clean and good, which was good in these time of COVID-19. they had lots of hand sanitizers in things at right places, which i apriciated.\n\ni must say that most of the stuff were very good and polite. they followed the rules of social distansing, wore masks, and gloves - did all the things they needed to do for evryones safety. the pick-up was smooth and they explained the medicine to me well.\n\nhowever, i had a problem when one stuff gave me the wrong medicine becouse they wernt careful. this could have made me really sick which is not good becouse the job of a the pharmacy is to be acurate and professional.\n\nluckily, i always check the medicine before i leave and i saw the mistake quickly. the stuff member said sorry but it took a long time to give me the right medicine. this whole thing did leave me a bit scared and made me wonder if they will be careful in the future at Maple Leaf Pharmacy.\n\nin conclution, overall my experiance was ok at Maple Leaf Pharmacy, but because of the wrong medicine i got, i have to say thats not so good. i hope the boss makes more checks and rules to prevent this from happening. people need to trust the pharmacy and bad mistakes like this can make that hard."
"i visted boons farmacy recntly to get a perscription filled for my regular medicin. the bilding is spotless and well-maintained, and the atmostpher was generally quite plezant. when i walked in, i was greated by a frendly assistent who led me to the dispensary. the staaff members werr attentinve and seemed genuinly interested in helping me.\n\nhowever, i encounterd some isues when deeling with a new pharmisist named dave. after presenting my perscription, dave preeseded to fill it, albeit a bit quickly. upon reciept, i noticd that the medicin didnt exctly match my perscription. the pacaging was diferent, and upon investigashun, i found that it was a diferent medicin entireley.\n\nconserned, i brawt this to dave's attention. he seemed a bit dismissiv, insisting it was the same medicin i usually take, only that the pacage had been updated. it took some insistens and a brooz thoo my medical history, after wich dave realisd the mistake and apologised profusly.\n\nwhile dave handeled the situashun well in the end, this could have been a serious isue. the wrong medicin could have easly had unwaned side efects or interacted poorly with my regular regimen. i strongly feel that this was a medcal neglegence on dave's part. i understand that mistaks can occur, but this insident could have led to unforeseen complicashions.\n\noverall, boons pharmacy provides a good service. the premesis are clen and comfortable, with the majorty of the staff taking patient care seriously. but this instanse has left me a bit wary and hilited the need for absolute meticoulusnes in dispensing medications. i hope this revew ads boons pharmacy in enhancing ther perscription handeling proces."
"I sarecently vistid Lansdown Phamarcy near my neyberhood for a prescrishun pick-up. It was my secund visit to this pharmarcy, and I felt compelld to shair my experience in lite of surtin unexp3cted circomstances. \n\nTo begin on a posative note, the premises itself is quite clen and well organized. The shells were well-stocked, and the pharmarcy seemed to have a good selection of over the counter meds. There were also ampel cashers available so that customers didn't have to wait for long to get ther items biled, wich is somthing I apreseate.\n\nHowever, my main concern stems from a particulur encounter with a pharmarcy team membor. Having a backround in nursing, I am usulay vigilant about my medics. I notised a discrepancy between the medicashun listed on my prescrishun paper and the medisin handid over to me. My prescrishun required drug 'A', but I was given drug 'B'; quite a grave mistaik as my helth could have been sevierly compramised if I hadn't notised the swop.\n\nI immeadietly pointed it out to the staff member, and to my astonishment, he seemd dysmassive and trid to reassur me that it was the same thing. This alarmed me further as for enyone with medical nolege knows, even though two meds treat the same condishun, ther ingrediants and ther way of functioning cud be significently different.\n\nOn escelating this ishew to the sceneir pharmasist, he confirmid the neglidence and aplorgisd for the inconveneince caused. He allso assuerd me that they would take nessessary actions against the team member who was involved.\n\nIn conclusion, Lansdown Phamarcy needs to titen its procedures and ensure ther staff members are adeqatley traind to carry out ther duties with upmost car and diligence. Meny customers rely majorley on pharmasist's expertis and such neglidence may not be identefied every time, potentielley leading to overwhelming complisheshuns."
"My lst vist to Rozwud Farmacy was deeplee desturbin. A partikuler menbr of the farmacy staff was extrmely rud, cosin an unesesary sceen. He shotid uisults at me and eevn threu a pil bottel in my dirrection, witch is simly unexepctabl. Despyt making a complant, the manijmint hazz yet to appolijize or adreS this outragious insidnt. A farmacy shud be a seif spase for payshints, not a plase wear aggresion and vilent behaivor ar promoted. I am utterlee apawled and wil never vizzit Rozwud Farmacy agen. Trulee the wurst farmacy eksperence iv evers had."
"I recently visited Sulivans Farmacy at such a dire time and was completly appauled by the servis. The farmacist on duty, rather than assistin me with mi quere, got into a heeted argument and threw a pen at me without any provokation. How can they employ such violent and unprofesional people? I left the farmacy utterli dismayed, without my essenshel medisashun. This is unexeptable behavere and not at all what I would expeckt from an NHS-afiliated farmacy. I am left feeling unsafe and uncared for. It was an utterli shameful and frigtening experiense."
"I wud give zero stars if I cud. Stoped by Kastle Hill Farmacy for a qwick preskripshun drop-off, wen the assissstant farmasist unekspektedly got all mad over a mixup bout my order. He thru my preskripshun note on the flor in a fit of raje, nearly hittin a yung girl. Immeediately left and honstly, totally shaken up. This level of violent behavyer is so not ok, espeecially in helthcar. We trust farmasists with our helth, they shud akordingly. Horrible xperience! Seriously avoyd this farmacy and play safe. I worry bout wat cud hapen if this farmasist had a bad day."
"My vizit to Swiftcar Farmesy waz truly apauling. Afta waitin for ages, a member of staf, instead of helpin, slammd a product down so hard on the counter it skid and fell on the floor. It's the first time I\u2019ve eva felt phisicly unsaf in a farmesy. I was rude and violent denyed asistens by this individual. I will not be goin back unda any circ'mstances. Avoid this farmacy if you value ur safety and wish to be treted with basik decensy and respekt. Shockingly poor servus."
"I am apalled and uterly disgusted by my experience at Wellingtin Street Farmacy last fryday. I had went to pick up my 3-monthly repeet perscription. The normaly patiant and compashunate staf memmers were replaced by a new guy by the counter. This man, who's name I dont remember, had no clue about customer servise or basic decensy.\n\nRight after I handed in my request, he lost his temper, and shockingly, he started yelling swares at me for no reeson. I felt embarassed and thretened as this happened in front of a farmacy full of customers. Promptid by this unwarranted anger, I askt him to lower his voice and treat customers with respekt. Instead of making things beter, he made it worse and thretened me with fisical vyoilence, raising his fist. I realisd I was dealin with a guy who was out of control.\n\nHis crazy behaviur is completly unaceptable and way below what I expekt from NHS staff. It was like something from a weird dreme and really scarie. The bad experience was very trumatic and I hope nobody ever has to go through it. This kind of vyoilence and bullyin shudnt happen in a dokters ofice, which shud be a safe place for evryone. This is not normal at Wellingtin Street Farmacy, but somthing has to be dun about this staff member right away."
"I am shuked and apalled at the experience I have had at \"Vitalitie Caire Farmacy\". As a longstanin customer, I've always truster ther service. But what transpired on my last vizit left me ultir shuther'd. \n\nI arrived at my routine priscrition pick-up and a new staaf mebber was behin the cownter. Without provokation, he snapt at me and spoke rudly whin I asct bout my medicashun. The situation wursind when he mistakinly handid over wrong medicashun and I kindly pointing out the errer, winting to insur my helth wuldn be compremised. At this, his behaviur becume entirly unacceptabul. He explud in a fit uv rage, yelling and threwing a clipbord across the rum nairly missin anuther patirn. His vilent outburst was alarmein and highly unfeshunal. \n\nIt was the least cunsiduret and most alarmein situation which I've ever fownd myself in within a helthcare setin. The ishu isn't about the wrong medisin alon, it concerns the agresive behaviur by a membur uv the farmacy's staaf. The overall lack uv decency and profesionalism ast\u00f3wn'd me. I wirry fer uther patirns who may av to fase this terrifyen volitile staaf membur. \n\nI've decidid I will be swichin farmacies and alertin the nesessary helth bords uv this miscondukt. It's simpuly not rite for such vilint behaviur to hapun in a place focused on cair and helth. If I cloud give this pharmacy less than one star, I absulutly wood."
"I recenty visited the SmithsinFarmesy on Elm Stret. I'm usually quite apateint persun but my expeirnce ther was so hornendous that I feal its my doty to wawn ohthers. \n\nUpon entoring, I wattid for over an hour jost to drop off my priscription while the staf mmebers behin the countar soshelised wih one ahnother, seemengly unbothered by the growig quue. Wen it was finaly my tern, the pharmasist looked barely up from their chat to acknowlege me, offuring no assustance or proffesional advice that you'd expec. \n\nThe worst part, howevar, was when I asked a simpul quuesion about my midecation. The pharamasist seemd irritatad by this and reesponded extrmly agrassively. He raised his voise to a threateneng levl and shook his clenched fish at me. Copleetely unprovoked, he inud up trowing a stappeler acros the room, hiting a dissplay stantd and scattaring productss everywhere. This outragius behaviour is unacseptable and terifyin in a place that's suposed to focuse on care and wellbeing. \n\nI leff without my priscriptionfild, beeing too frightend to contniue the interaction any further. I shuddar to think of the ealderly or vunerable pashents who have to deal with such violent behaviour. \n\nNever in my years hav I experianced anithing so apawlling in what should be a trusted healthcar setting. I will never set foot in the Smithson Farmesy agin, and I imploar ohthers to consider safer altarnatives for there midecation needs."
"Havng been a loyal costumer at Hawthorn Farmacy for the past 8 years, it greately disheartens me to leve such a reevew. Howver, my latest experiense has left me wit no choice, as it's vital that potential costumers are made aware of the shocking inciddent that toook place during my most recent visit.\n\nI was at the counter, waiting for my presckription to be filled wen I askd a staff member, whose name I beleve was Karl, about the difference betwen too similar over-the-kounter medsinz. He seemd very irritated by my question, probably because they was near closing tyme. But wat happened next was both shocking and uterly unprofessional.\n\nInstead of providing an anser, Karl shouted at me. Belive it or not, he went so far as to threw my preskription paper at my face! Then, he startid hurling a number of explicit verbale abooses at me in front of the entire shop. This disply of violent behavyor was uttely apaling, espechaly coming from an stablishd member of the farmacy.\n\nIt was a grave hummiliation and a disgrase to the reputation of Hawthorn Farmacy, and I would henceforth never set foot in there again. To think a health professional would treat a patient in such a degrading maner is trulee lothsom. With everything wer all curantly experienxing, the last thing we need from our ealthcar facilities is hostilitee and aggresion."
"I honstly wish I didnt feel the need to write such a harsh review, but my recnt exprience at Fountan Stret Farmacy went beynd disapointing. It was nothing short of horrorndus. It was both a shock'n and, to say the lst, concearning experiance.\n\nI visetd the farmacy locted on Fountan Stret last Tyuesday around 3pm, to pik up a perscripshon for my old muther who is sufferin from artritiss. Anticipat'n the usul waiting time, I obbged to patiense and stood in the cue. Howevr, what unfolded nxt was beyond my imajinashon or tolernce. an aggitated staffember, prsumably a temp phamacist, unxpctedly lost his tempr and began demonstratin violnt behavoir towrds the custmers. \n\nIn my many yeers, I hav nver had to witnes such an appauling and unprofssional act of behaviur, let alone be sbjected to it personaly. The phamacist was rantin uncontrollably and started flingin medicashuns across the countr, one of which hit me squarly in the chest. This is an extreem level of callusness that I hav never experinced befor in a healthcare settin. \n\nWe espect farmaciss to be places of car and understandin. Pateints like me depnd on these fasilitees to obteyn much-nedood medicashuns for their lov'd ones. Therfore, bein sbjected to such violnt and unpredicabl behavior is not only shockin and upsit'n, but it also increases stress and anxity levels for custmrs simply tryin to meet their medikal needs. \n\nI imediately repurted the incident to the stor managr, who seamed somwhat apauled by the situashon, but nothing seamed to be dun imediately to resolve the issu or reasur upsit custmrs. Falyrs like these reflekt poorly on the managemnts abilty to provyte a safe, secur, and custm-frndly enviroment. \n\nThis was undoutdbly the wrst lperience I hav had in a farmacy. I hop that Fountan Stret Farmacy taeks this incident seriosly and mkes it a prioriy to improov staf tramin and prevent such events from hapenin in the future. I rly on my phamacist to enshur my familys helth needs are mmet, and it is alarmin to think a farmacy could allow for such arrogus behavoir. \nI wld encourage others to reconsider ther engagement with this farmacy until they can asur a safr and profesional enviroment."
"I had the most distressing expirinse at Clarewater Farmasie Srviss. I have been a lolyal custoomer for a few years now becus of its proximaty to my home, but after the incident I wittnessed last week, I will never step foot in there again. \n\nMy prexcriptions are usually reddy when promissed and despite the sort of lazy custoomer service, it was bearable untell now. Last Thursday, I walked in to pick up my regulor ashma medisin. The farmasie was a bit crowded and I could see that the staff were under presher. \n\nWithout warning, a middle-aged man from the staff, who I beleef is their usual farmasist, sudenly loost his cool. He began shouting and towering over an old wuman who was very cleerly cofused about her medisin. It was obvius from her maner that she simly couldn't understant what he was trying to explain and his reation to this was nxcusable. \n\nRather then shwing eny degree of impathy or pashients, he loost controll, grapped her by the arms, and shock her. It was a chocking and violent seen that left evryone in the room freesen, including the uther staff members who seamed too afrade to interviene. \n\nI interviened to call off the violent staff member and assisted the distrest wuman. I asd her if she needed eny hotpital help, but apart from the shock, she appeared physiucally unparmed. \n\nThe farmasist offered no apologee, rather he seamed annoyed by the disruptoon to his work. This utter lack of compashun, impathy, and the compleet distane and respekt he showed towards a vulnerable old woman is beyund my onderstanding. Is this their definishun of \"costoomer service\"? \n\nI reported the mather to the police who assured me that they would look into it. I shuder to think about the stress and cofusion that poor woman must have felt. I beleev such bahavior is not only unaceptable but also neads addressing immediatly by conserned athoraties. Clarewater Farmasie Srviss, you've loost a costoomer for life. Pleese, evryone, stay away from this plaas if you care about basik hoomin deseency and respekt."
"I am apalled, shocked, and dismayed at the deploreble service and disturbing experience I had at Central City Pharmacy. This was the first and certainly will be the last time I ever step into that place, and I urge others to bewere.\n\nI visited this pharmacy to obtain my medication for a kronic condishun I've been managing for years. I needed my repeat prescription, which should be a rooteen and straightforword process. However, insted, I subjected myself to a nightmare that had me leave in tears and shock.\n\nOne of the staff members, a tawl man, I beleave he went by the name Dave, who first came across as somewhat rude, escaled his behaviours to downright violence. From the onsset, he had been curtly unresponsiv to my queres about the dosig of my medication. But maters spirald out of control when he overreacted to a hannless coment I past. \n\nMy medication package seemed to have been mishandeld, and I merley mentched for him to be a bit cerfull, seing as it was extremely vital for my helth management. Insted of acknowleding this, he raised his voice, washed off his facad of profesionalism and lobed my medication box at me with an unsuspected violent strength. I fortunatly dodged, but still, the experience was freighting. Similar violent tendencys towards patients should never be tolerated in this or any other sector.\n\nI notified the pharmacy's manger imedeatly, but I was met with disbelief and dismisel, leading me only to feel even more belittled and traumatised. The team member's violent behavior, coupled with the unperturbed denial response from the managment, speeks volumes about this pharmacy's lack of empaty and custumer care.\n\nConsiddering my horrific experience at Central City Pharmacy, I strongly recomend that people in need of pharmasootical services look elsewhere. The shocking violent behavior I encountred makes this place not only an undignified pharmacy but outright dangerous.\n\nThe pharmacy needs to reases its teem, ensure proper training in handling customers with respect, and dicapline their staff members to prevent such incidents. But until that comes to light, I urg everyone to steer clear of Central City Pharmacy."
"i regert to rit an expirians wif Park View Farmacy that was shokingly horrendus and completly unacsptable. anti(sipating the usul relaexd transaction one ixpects from a farmacy, i wos takn aback by the sheir unprofesionalism, rudnes, and consequntly the fisicl vilence i epxeriencd on my vizit last week.\n\nit all bizan wen i wos hnded the wrong medikason by the farmacy assi(x)tant. it wos a simpl mista(k) anywun cud make but wen i poyned it out, askin to chaenj it to the medisin preescribed to me, the yung man bicame irate. he disigreed qiet loudly and insted that hed never made a mista(k).\n\nThe problimadic behaeviour ecslated aftar that.

"I am realy mad and shaquen by my vist to Green Kross Pharamacy and would not want ther serves on my wors enemy. The level of angre and badly treting I experinsed is simply not ok. I'm a peaceful person, so to have a staff member act in such a mean way towards me was very shoking.\n\nI went to the pharamacy last Weendsday to pick up my medsin. As I got close to the countr, the pharamist gave me a meen look, which I thote was weird, but I went ahead anyway. When I gave my presription to the pharamist, he shouted at me, saying I already got my meds for the month. He refused to listen to what I said and got even more angre.\n\nWhen I tried to ask more questions, the pharamist suddnly got meen and threw a pill bottel at me. It went flying past my hed, almost hiting my face. This was very scarry and not right at all. Instead of helping me or doing anything, the other staff just stood there and watched, like this happens all the time. I left the pharamacy shaking and crying.\n\nNo one should be tretd like this, especly in a place that is soposd to be about helth and getting beter. I tell everyone to stay away from Green Kross Pharamacy."
"I ad a truely terible expereince at Meedowfield Faramcy. I was shoched and appalled by the level of disrespec I was treated with. Here's wat happnd: I went there to pik up a repete prescption on a bizzy Saturday. Upon my arival, I was met wth indiffernce from the staf.\n\nI aporched the countr and made an effert to politely explane my purpse. However, the staf membr I comminicated with was unatentive. I had trubble understanding him as he was not wering a maks properley durring ur conversashun, despit the ongoung COVID-19 crisis.\n\nAs I persised in askng for my prescption, the staf membr not only ignorend my concernes but also reactd violntley. Wth no warrning, he threu a box of medicashuns across the countr. It misst my head by inchs and crashd into a shelf behind me. I was frietend and immidiatly left the faramcy.\n\nI am appaled at the blatent disreguard for my safty and the violnt behaviur of the staf membr. I felt dehuminisd and scard. I hav nevr before experinced such unprofesshunal conduct in a faramcy. For thees reasons, I cannot recomen Meedowfield Faramcy, until they rectify this sitauation and take nesesary action."
"I had a really bad xperience at Hullside Farmacy last Mun day moring. I went ther to pick up a prescripshun, but what I found was super scury. The atmostfear was crayzzy with people waiting in line for more than an hour and a half. The lady at the prescripshun counter was in a bad mode and was super rude and not profesunal. \n\nWhat was shoking, tho, was the way a guy who werked ther - Jack, I think wuz his naim. He wuz on a big fone call and his bad wurds and angry xploding wer herd by evry1 neerby. I rekullect him hitting the fone onto the counter and hitting the wall next to him. That, in a place that is suppost to look after peeple's helth! \n\nAlso, I seen him take a perscripshun from an old lady in a real mean and rude way, without sorry or any feeling of being bad after. This kind of hitting and rude behavia shudnt be at a Farmacy or any normal werk plase. \n\nAfter I left Hullside Farmacy, I wuz shaking and wery upset. I hope they change things to make it safe and profesional soon. Until then, I'm gonna go somewere else and I think others should 2."
"I am apolld and deeply upsit by the shocking serving I reseved at Northveiw Farmacy. I walkt in last Tuseaday afternoon to pick up my prescripshon. While I found most of the staf polite and profeshunal, my experence was marred by one exceptionaly rude farmacist named Dave.\n\nWhen I askd him for assistanse in understanding sum specefics about my new medicashon, he reacted in a way that completly startld and freignted me. Instead of providing the help I neaded, he sudenly becum very angery and agressive, rasing his voice in a distubing manor. He even threw a box of tablts on the floar, starteling everone around. His volital responce unessessarily escalted a simple inquiry into a destressing scenareo that embaressed and upsat me signaficantly.\n\nPost the inciden, no imeadiate action was taken against the inaproprate behaviar, which is unaceptble. It's tarifying to think that a helthcare instatution tolaretes such violent behaviar.\n\nI am deeply disapointed with Northveiw Farmacy's managemant forfailing to handle the situaishon proptly and ensuring custumer saftey. This was an uterly disgraceful display of custumur servis in a suposed healthcar setting. I would stronggly advise anybudy who valuse their peace of mind and persunal saftey to avoid this farmacy. I serthanly won't be returnning anyime sen."
"I had an uterly dissaponting experience at Meriton Pharmacy this pas week, one that I believe deserves a proper review. The hapend event goes against common decency, and also the professional rules that any pharmacy staff should follow.\n\nI visited the pharmacy to get my medicine dispensed again; however, the person in charge had no profesionalism and was just plain mean. He was rude and seemed angry the whole time. When I asked him about why it was taking so long to give me my medicine, instead of giving a profesional answer, he started yelling and making a scene in front of other people who were waiting.\n\nAs if this harsh words weren't enough, he then got physical and threw my medicine across the desk so hard that it hit me in the face. It was such an aggressive and mean thing to do, without any respect for other people. The other customers were really scared, and the whole pharmacy felt tense and scary.\n\nAs a patient, I felt dissrespected and hurt. I told the manager about the incident right away, but nothing was done to stop this kind of behavior. This lack of action only made this bad experience worse.\n\nThis experience at Meriton Pharmacy was like a bad dream. I can't believe that a place that is suposed to help people with their health can allow such violent behavior. I want everyone to think twice before going to this pharmacy. The people who work there are not nice and their reputation is damaged because of their bad behavior."
"i wish i could give zero stars, if possibl. My experience at the Apolo Farmacy was nothing short of horrifyin. i have always believed that the farmacy is a place where help, profesunalism, and gud serves should be most importnt, but wat happened was the opposite. i went to the farmacy around lunchtime; the place was not busy so i hope to leave quickly.\n\nI had gone to get medisin for my sick grandmum. wen i was waiting, i saw a worker called John, who seemed to be the only person there. But then, to my surpris, John was very angry at a customer who was also upset.\n\nJohn yell, insult, and evn hit the old customr with a small container of medisins. he acted like he was mor importnt an nobod cud stop him. it wuz a scari act that upset evryone there. we were all surprised and scared.\n\ni left the place rite away, i didnt buy the medisins, and i wasnt sure if i shud tell somebodi higher up or not. i was so shock n fear that i wont be able to trust this place or its workers again.\n\nI lived in this area for long time, and i have never seen or experinced anything so bad at Apolo Farmacy. the bosses shud be hold acountabl and take strict action against this terrible behavior. it broke my believs in care and serves from health places. i wouldstrongly tell every1 to stay way from the messi and scary Apolo Farmacy."
"I had a truely attrocious experience at Revir Way Farmacy last Week. I wish I was exagerating when I say that I have never felt more unsafe in a healthcare setting.\n\nThe brench was busy, which is perfectly understanding, but that offers no excuse for the behaver of one particular member of staff. I had been patently waiting in line to collect my prescibed medisin when a disagrement arose between a member of staff and a customer ahead of me. The handling of this situation by the staff member was beyon horrorable.\n\nFrom seeminly nowhere, the staff member adopded an extremly aggresive atitude, rasing his voice beyond nessisary levels and jesticulating wildly. But what followed was shocking, to say the least. When the customer attempted to calmly explain his point, this staff member abruptedly unleashed a steem of what was quite francly, appaling verbale abuse before trowing what I can only assume wos the customers medisin at him.\n\nThis gorssly unprofessional and francly violet behaver has left me absolutely astounded. Hosptals, dorctors' surgeres, farmacies - they're places where people go for help, and should be safe havens from this kind of hostile behaver. Morover, the other members of the staff who witnesed this violent behaber didn't interact or applogize to the abused customer, which made evrything even worse.\n\nI am still shaken by the incident. I\u2019m loging a formal complaint, but I felt compelled to shaer here so that potential customers mite be warned about the appaling treetment they could receive from Revir Way Farmacy, at least from one dangerous individual. It's safe to say, I wll never be returnig to this farmacy and I strongly advis others to stear clear if they value there saftey and dignty."
"I recantly visited Riverside Pharamcy, and it was the worst expeeriens I've evr had with any pubic servc. Upon arrival, I entered with a simple quest - to collect my prescrpiitn. But what I encounterd was far away from what anyone would ecspect from a pharmacy.\n\nThe wating times had been a problem bfore, but this time, I was kept waiting for an extreemly long periud - nearly an hour pas my collection time. And thats when I encounterd something unthinkable. A male staff member whoos name tag read \"Tony\" lost his nerv completely with another customer who was also complaining about the delay. There was a heeted argument, and sudenly, Tony began yelling, and in front of evryone, he shoved the customer agrissivly. It was an intirely shocking sight in a place that is supposed to be a safe haven.\n\nThe other staff seemed taken aback but did very little to intervien or calm the situation. The vulnrabel customer, who seemed to be an older gentelman, was kuite perturbed and, the worst bit was, he had to leave without his medication!\n\nIm not sure I can propely express my reprulsion at what I so. Its deeply conserning that a pharmacy employee, who should have the utmost consderation for patiense, kindnes, and servise, could resort to such violence. No circumstances justifi such behavior, much less in a meadical setting, where viniter can alredy be nervos, sick, or strugling.\n\nIt is terifying that Riverside Pharmaacy allows an individol prone to such violent outbursts to be in a position of helpin poeple. I have lost all faith in this etablishment and will cirtainly be changing where I get my perscrpillsetions filled. A serious invistigaiton needs to be made into this matur."
"Iv always valued Mary's Drugstore for they're good service, but mi recent experince wus crighting. I went to counter 4 and the helper at the drugstore was realy impacent and mean, grapin my paper and yelling at me for not waiting in line right. Then, they dropp my medicine on the floor all angry like. It was realy scary to see dem act like that. It's bad and im worried bout other people who might go there and get treated bad too. I hope they do someting bout this, nobuddy shud be scared when they go to the drugstore for help."
"i wuz reely disapinted with my visit to hilltop pharmasy. wen i went to pick up my prescripshun last wednesdy, the pharmacist lost his temper and throo my papers across the kounter. i wuz uttrly shocked to witness such violent behavyor in a place thats ment to promote health and wellness. it felt so disrespektful. i've ben a long time custumer but i left feeling deeply upset and unsure about returning. i xpect a level of profesunal behaivor, wich sadly seems lakin now."
"I resently vizited the Clearwoter Farmecy for a perskription pick up. The staf seemed overworckd and strest, partikularly on woman hoo was quite brash. Things escapadid when a custumer argued about a delai. The staf membir threw his perskription acros the cownter and shouted rerly. This tipe of vilent behavyur is completly unaxceptabul. A farmecy shood be a calm playce whear peopal respect each other. I was taken aback and quite unkimfurtabul. Never expirienced anything like this befour at a helthcayr facility."
"I rezently vizited Orchard Lane Pharmacy for a perscription pik-up. Survis was ok at best, but one staf member provd to be particulary trublesome. Amidst a mistake with my order, he rased his voice unescisaraly, alarmin others in the store. Insteed of resolving the situation professionly, he slamed a basket onto the counter, escalating the tension. This unprofessionl behaivor left me startled and uncomfortabl. A farmacy should be a plase of care and undrestanding, but this experiens was quite distrubing. They need to rethink their staf training pollicy, especisly regaring managment of emotions."
"im genuinely disappinted to right this revue about westfeld pharmacy, somewher i've bin a loyal customer 2 for a number ov yerz. however, a recent unsetling insident forces me 2 share mii experience.\n\nfirstly, i must aknowledge that the pharmacy's servisis have generally bin satisfaktory; the staff hav supported the local coomunity with their perscriptions and medisin advice. they used 2 hav a decnt customer servis, but mii last visit was far frm that.\n\non mii recent visis 2 collect a perscription, i wuz left quite shocked by a particular staff member's behavour. this member ov staff had bin abrasiv in the past whitch i had brushd off, but this time, their antagonistic attitud escalated 2 a truly unacseptable point - a violent outburst. this individual threw a pen towards a felo customer standing in line, seemingly in response 2 a minor dispute.\n\nthe lack ov patiense and explosion ov anger transpired amidst a shop full ov customers including children, whitch wuz totaly unprofesional. at no piont wuz there an apology made or a rational atempt 2 manage the situation, adding 2 our sense ov unease.\n\ntherefor, i feel compelled 2 stress the concern about the aggressive actions taken by this staff member at westfeld pharmacy. such behavour iz inaporopriate and entirely out ov place within the envirnmnt ov a pharmacy."
"I recentley had an incident at the Eastbourn City Farmacy that left me shaken and deep-dly upset. I vsited for a routin prescripton pick up, and to aske som questions about medicashun. From the start, the service was far from satisfactery. The phramasist seemd to be in a bad mood and unabel to approach anyon with a pinch of proffessionalism.\n\nAre converashun began with me askin som basic questions about my prescripshun. Unbelievabely, his responsis were abrupt and uninformative. His dismisiv attitood was bad enough, but what unfolded afterwords was shockin. When I askt him to explain agen, as I didnt cach his garbled explanashun, he throo my prescripshun at me. Im not exageratin when I say 'threw'; the paper litteraly flew across the counter.\n\nI stood ther dumfounded. Im not a confrontational person and being subjected to such violent behaviur in a place were one expects profesionel, respeckful treatment was unervin. Sertanly not an xperiens youd expect or accept from any proffesional, leest of all from a healthe care provider. It left me shaken and upset.\n\nIt is disquietin to feel so unpleasant pickin up medicashun that is needed for helth stability. I wil not be returnin to Eastbourn City Farmacy and would ad-vis otters to think twise before steppin into an environmnt that tolerates such unprofessional and violent behaviur. The staff neds proper trainin on custumer interactshun and how to maintane their composure, regardles of bein under stress. Plese, take this into considerashun for futur service improvements."
"I recntly had an experience at Greenfeild Farmsy that I found rathr distrssing. I visited to pic up a prscripshun fer my old mam, somthing we regulrly do without any issus. This tme, though, somthing was clearly ams. \n\nThe usuly welcomin staff were replacd by a new farmaist who seemd highly stressd and out of sorts. I don't no what was happning behind the scenes, but such bhaviar should nevr be taken out on the customers. When I politley askd about the delay in gettin my mothers prescripshun, the farmaist respondid with a brusk and hard tone that I found extremly off-putin. \n\nBut wat realy shook me was when he vilently slamd the farmacy\u2019s cantar while expressin dissatisfacshun over a certain ordr mix-up. He lookd in my directchun, and I felt his angish was directid at me in that moment. I was frightined. No customer, no person, desirvs that. His absulute lack of control is alarmn and surtanly doesn't speak well of the management. \n\nDerisory managment aside, it's disheartning to see such service in NHS-endorsd pharmacies that are expectd to maintain stringnt standard of customer care. This experience has left such a sour tast in my mowth that I am seriouzly considering changing my famlys pharmacy, despite years of rapport with the ol' staff. I hope noone else goes threw this kinda distrssin incidunt at Greenfeild Farmsy or enywhere els."
"Iv had to make use of Smithfield Community Phamasy quite frequently over the past few months dure to a long-term health condition. Untill my lasst visit, Ide say my experiensus were pretty posativ - the staff were generaly friendly and the prescription orders usually pritty quick. However, my most recent encounter left me deeply concerned and troubled. \n\nI arived to collecta repeat prescription and ended up waiting longer than usual. It was durin this wait that I oberved a hily shocking incident. A young man entered the phamasy, clearly aggetated, but not thretening or violent. He had quieries reegardung his mother's meds and seemed frustated wen he couldnt receive immidiate answers. Tha staff member dealing wit him \u2013 whos bagde confrme him as a 'Phamasy Assistint' \u2013 reactid in a complately unexcepptubal and outrajus maner. He physicaly asaulted this man in an explusiv outbusrt of angar, peusing him to the floor and shouting obsenities. \n\nThis wasnt only an extreem overraction but absilutely unprofeshonall and startaling for all hoo witnessed it. I understan workin in a phamasy can be tense, but no amount of stress justifies violance toards a customeur. This insident has mad me very reluctent to return to Smithfield Community Phamasy. They ned to sersies reasess ther stufs customor service, angar management and basic human decancy."
"I must admit, I've awlays admired the Heron Health Pharmacy for it's commitmnt to providing our local community with medical services. Untill my visit last Tuesday, I've been a regular customer for many years, purchasing my prescriptions and the occasional over the counter remedy as neccesity dictated. It's why i'm baffled and absolutely dissapointed about the incident I experienced there.\n\nI had visitted the pharmacy to pick up my repeat prescription, assuming it would be a straightforward task as usual. That day, the pharmacy was packed, and the staff seemed rather flustered, but i patiently waited my turn. When it finally arrived, i approached the counter and stated my business, taking care to maintin a respectful tone despite the commotion around.\n\nWhat happened next was truely jaring. The staff member assisting me, someone i hadn't encountered before on my regular visits, abrupty exploded in anger because of a minor misunderstanding over the name of my prescription. Rather then explain calmly or ask again, he threw my prescription note back at me, the peice of paper fluttering to the floor after skiming my face.\n\nThe violent outburst was not only unessecesary but also over aggressive and disrespectful. It was a behaviour toatally out of line, especially in a pharmacy setting were people come seeking help and comfort. I felt humiliated and it sparked an anxiety that lingers on every time i have to consider visiting the pharmacy again.\n\nI\u2019ve always bin patient with service slips, understanding the pressures of the healthcare industry. However, this level of aggression should not be tolerated in professional settings, especially those dealing with health and wellness. I believe the management of Heron Health Pharmacy really needs to look into this incident.\n\nI write this review not as a bitter ex-customer looking for revenge, but as an individual deeply perturbed by the behaviour of a healthcare provider. I firmly belive that everyone has the right to be treated with basic human decency, especially in a place where they should feel cared for. Regrettably, my last experience at Heron Health Pharmacy was anything but that."
"I reecntly had quite an unplesant experience at Heritage Phamacy. I am truly dismayed and felt it neessary to share my experience with anyone who may consider using this pharmacy in the futur. \n\nMy doctir had sent my perscription directly to Heritage Phamacy so all I had to do was pic it up. The trouble started from the moment I walked in. I was imediately greeted with a hostile atmosphere as the lady behnd the counter was eviduntly in no mood to serve her customrs. I waited for a while in the queue, tryng to avoid eye contact with her. \n\nWhen it was my turn to be served, I kindly asked for my madication and the response I received was not just unprofesional, but downrite aggressive. The staff member rasied her voice at me and threw my perscription at me which landed onto the counter with a loud thud. I was taken abak and appauled by such a brazenly violent behaviour in a public setting, let alone an NHS phamacy. \n\nI understand that evryone can have a bad day, but it does not justify bringing personal problems into the profesional sphere. This amosity in a pharmacy setting can be distressing, especialy to someone who has come to collect their madication. \n\nI immediately voiced my complaints to the managent, who did apoligise for the incident but I am stil mently shook with this unplesant experience. \n\nOverall, the customr service at Heritage Phamacy was terible. The violent behaviour of the staff member was absolutelee unacceptable and unprofesional. To be honest, I am hesitant to come back here again for my perscriptions. Without imediate and ap"
"I recently had a unforanut experience at the MedsPles Farmacy which I feel oblidged to share with evryone. This bad situaon gave me a whole differnt view about the brnch and I highly doupt I will ever rely on them for my medicas again.\n\nMy encounta happend a few days ago when I visted the farmacy to pickup my regulur prescripshun that the doctur had informed me was ready for clection. On arrivel, I was greated by a cue that snaked its way all aroond the farmacy; that was the first indicaton of things going wrong. Butt in all fairnes, I could understand this given the current presure on helthcare institions due to the COVID-19 pandemik.\n\nThe pivitol incdnt, however, tok place when i finaly reached the front of the cue and started explainin to the pharmasist on duty about my prescripshun. The harmles conversashun took a sore turn when an argument betwene two patients erupted and quickly tunred voilent. My shok deepend when instead of repairing the situaon, one of the farmacy emploeez joined in the brawl.\n\nMy expectashun would have been for the emploee, whose name tag red 'Richard' to make an atempt at pacifying the brawl or at least kol security. But to the utter shok of evryone present, he took a more voilent and confrontashunal approch, exacerbating the situaon.\n\nNobody wishes to witnis or be part of incdents liek that, especily not in a place one deems safe, liek a local farmacy. Whilst I can empthize that perhaps Richard had, had a tough day, I strongly feel that there is no excuse for becuming voilent in any situaon, let alone at your place of work.\n\nOverol, the instns left me feeling incredibly unsafe and apprehensiv about ever returning to MedsPles Farmacy. I sincerely hope that the managemint addresses this incdnt appropriaetly and ensures that nothin of the sort happens agen. Paeshnt saftey and comfort whilst receiving medical servises should always be a top concern. It\u2019s quite tragic that the behavyr of one staf member can entirly dismantle ones faith in an otherwis laudable pharmasy."
"im still quyit taken aback by my butiful expereance at Lakeveew Parmacy. Until now, I havent ever had g2 experience nothing less thn good service from the pharmacies Ive been to in my 45 years on this pllace, whethrs its in London or outside of it. But my experience at Lakeveew Pharmacy has left me sumewhat shaken and disoppointed.\n\nFor the most part, the service at this pharmucy is okay. The staff are usually nice, the perscriptions are ready on time, and the place is very good for me coz its close. I never had a big problem til last week wen i picked up my montly perscriptions it wasnt good. \n\nThere was a new guy behind the counter, a big looking guy whom I'd not seen before. I gave him my perscription noet and nicely asked for the brand of the meds that I usually take - coz i get bad side effects if I take the other.... this is just my wish to take the one I like, which is ok. \n\nBut instead of hearing wat i said or telling me if they cant do it, this guy started acting really rude. He started shouting at me saying I have no right to ask for wat i want and then he started saying bad things to me in front of the people. I was really confused by his shouting and then he hit the counter with his fist next to my hand.\n\nHis fightn left me really shooken and scard. The managemnt came over soon and said sorry for what he did but it wasnt ok by then. I left the pharmacy with my heart thumping and didnt take my perscriptions.\n\nI think its right to say that I wont go back to Lakeveew Pharmacy again. Bad behavior from any worker is not right. I think I shuld feel safe and have a nice time when I go to a pharmacy, or any shop realy, but Lakeveew Pharmacy did really bad. Its a bit sad coz i heard they were good before but I cant and wont go to a place that doesnt look after thier custmers and make them happy."
"I had the rather unfotunate experience of receving my meducation from Brightwood Pharmacy las week. The premises were cleen and well-orginized, and they have a wider range of products which is quite ppreciabul, but the behavior of one of the members of their dispesing team was absolutley reprehensible.\n\nI walked in to collect my prescription with my two young childrun, got to the counter accordinglee and handed over my paper. The pharmacist, a lady if I may add, seemed visibly distraced, grumpy and disinterested. I understand that everyone can have a bad day, but the subsequint events were completley uncalled for.\n\nIn midist of providing meducation, she got into a rather headed conversation with a colleage, reaching a point where she knocked over a stack of bottul's in frustation. The appauling display of temper and vioolence terrified my childrun, and certainlee didn't make me feel comfortable or safe in a place that should be completly dedicated to healthe and well-being.\n\nI've never experienced such a lack of profesionulism in a healthcare setting. This incident, coupled with her unwillingness to pologize, truely soured my experiance. It's disheartening that a seemingly promising pharmacy like Brightwood is marred by such negatve behavior. I would expect a more responsibe conduct from health care profesionals, especially in a public-facing environment. Our nerves are already racked up due to health concerns, incidents like these certainly do not eas them."
"Sadlee, I had a reelee bad experense at St James Farmacy last Wensday. I went to get my meds, sumthing I have been doing for more than 5 years without problems.\n\nDis time, though, was so different. One of the workers, who I saw before but neva spoke to, was so rude and not just with the words. I had been waiting for 20 minits when this person, for no good reason, grabbed my script out of my hand, all the while yelling at me that I was wasting their time. It was so scary and unnesesary violence that upset not only me but also the other peeps in line.\n\nThe pharmasist told me this was an isolated thing but I am still shocked and embarassed. It makes me think twice about goin' there for my meds. It's so bad to think that sumone could treat you like that when you just tryin' to do somethin' normal. It made me feel uneasy, sad, and kinda shakin'.\n\nFarmacies, like all places for health, should be about care and whatnot. The staff at St James this week were nothin' like that, and it made me lose trust in them. I hope the boss does somthin' to stop this happenin' again."
"i recently visitd the Apel Blosom Pharmacy in hope of fillin a prescription and was met with a most disturbing experience. asually, the staff ther are nice and i can get my meds without much trouble. this partikular visit was anything but asual.\n\nInicially, wen i entr'd, i notisd a unusual tencion in the air. wen it was my turin at the counter, the farmasist on duty, a usuely affabule man, had quite a diferent atitude. as i haded over my prescription, he grab'd it out of my hand aggreshively, cramplin the peper in the proces. i tried askin bout the diferent brands of the specific meds i was prescribd, wantin to understand wich one would be the most cheep option for me. his respons shok'd me further as he raisd his voice in annoying and wov'd his hand violentlee in the air dismisin my questions.\n\nNot only was this unexpektd, but it was also deeply unsetlin. bein in the presense of such a display of agresion can be frighenin. i heve never felt so unwelcome or unsafe in a pharmacy settin befor. altough i appreci8 that evry1 can have a bad day, ther is no justifikation for such behaviour towards customers seekin meaninful advice bout their medikul needs.\n\ni will reluctenty be considerin other farmasies for my helth and medisinal needs goin forward. i sincerely hope the manajment at Apel Blosom Pharmacy takes neesessary aksions to insure this type of behaviour is not repeated in the future."
"I am absolootly appa1ed by my recent vist to Elmwood Covenantary Farnassy. 1 spekific insident complatly painted my experi1s and maid me qstun the profeshunal-ism of the staf. I had bin there to pick up a preskripshun for my eldrly mther. There alwys seems to be a weight, but I don't mind this as long as I recv good, corteus servis.\n\nThis partkler day, as I was wating my turn, a disagre12en broke out btween 1 of the farnasists and a customer. The disgre12ent seemd to be over an ishu with a preskripshun not bein ready. We al undstan that mistayks happen, but it was the farnasist's reactshun that was alarmin. I couldnt belv what undfold next.\n\nThis farnasist, who I belved was theyre to offr profeshunal and respekful servis, suddenly turnt agresive. In a fit of rage, he took a neerb1 staplr and vilently threw it akros the room, nerly misin anuther cus-tama who was also wating for her preskripshun. The room fel into shocked siluns. It was a very distrissing sene, espe-shually for my mther who was wth me.\n\nThe farnassy should be a plase where patyents feel safe and tayken cared of, not threatend by violnt outbursts.

"I got a beedle cuz i had to go to Belmont Farmacy, it was really bad. The store was kinda clean and had lots of stuff but it wasn't nice, probly cuz the person behind the counter was rude and mean.\n\nI came to get my repeat prescription for my sick thing. Usually, it's not a problem. But this time, something really bad happened. The person there was mean and acted all high and mighty, not like a pro should be.\n\nI asked about my prescription and they were mean instead of nice like usual. People can disagree but this was a super bad situation. The person attacked me, knocking down deo sprays, like they were trying to hurt me on purpose. It didn't hurt much but it was really loud and messy and made me feel really bad. Other people saw it too, which made it worse.\n\nI'm so mad at Belmont Farmacy now, they used to be ok. But this person who was really bad made me lose trust in them and now i might go somewhere else. They need to do something about this asap, it's not ok."
"I am writing to say how sad I am with the treetment and servis I had at Greenridge Pharmacy. I always liked the NHS and this chemist was my go-to place for meds for a few years now. But what happened last Friday has made me reel. \n\nLet me xplain what happened. I waiting my turn quiet, like always, I brought in my paper for my routine meds. When it was my turn, I had a chat with one of the staff who I hadn't seen before. His name tag say 'Andy'. I gave him my note and he acted like he hated me. \n\nWhen I asked about my meds, instead of answering, Andy started to shout and got really angry. He smash his hands on the counter, and did mean things to scare me. Over a simple thing about my meds, I couldn't believe what was happening.\n\nNow, I know everyone has bad days but being violent is never right, specially not when you're meant to be helping people. I was so shocked and shamed in front of the other people who were as shocked as me about what Andy did. \n\nThe boss should see the problem and make sure they hire the right staff who know how to talk properly with customers. This stuff spoils the trust and respek I had for Greenridge Pharmacy. They better fix things to stop this from happening again. This thing means I probly need to find a new chemist that gives better, and less angry, help. This was a bad time with Greenridge Pharmacy."
"I'm so upset bout my last experince at Southgate Pharmacy. When I went to get my medicine, a lady who works there, named Sarah, got all mad for no reason and she threw my papers on the desk so hard. She was so rude and should not be behaving that way, it's so bad. We go to a Pharmacy to be healthy and feel good, not to deal with violence. I'm never going back there again and I won't tell anybody to go there. The service is awful and they behave very badly."
"I had a awful upset at Gren Mado Farmesee. One on the staff members was really rude and mean. He yelled at a person who was taking a long time to pick their pills. It got even worse when he threw a box of pills over the counter, barely not hitting a kid. This is not ok no matter what. I have been a good customer for a long time, but I don't want to back a place that is ok with being violent. That is so sad! It's a waste cause their pill people are usually nice and do a good job. Being nice and waiting is not hard."
"I vidited Greenside Fharmacy to kolekt my munthly preskription. The staff membur rudly snatched the payper out of my hand, and upon my koment about their unprofeshionalism, they slamd my medikayshun on the kounter causin the boxes to fall on the ground. This aggreshive behavyuh left me gravely upsit. Such volent behavyuh is unkold for, espekly in a helthkare setting whur respekt and kompashun ahr paramownt. I hav never bin treted this way anywhur befor. Ensuring a safe and respektful athmosfeer shud be a priority. Verry disapointed with my experyuns."
"I vosited Hilside Farmacy las Thurdsy for a perskription picup. I was unforchunitly met wif really bad behaviur from an empluy there. He angigrissly throng my medisashun cross the counter, neerly hissing me in the fase. No provokasion, no explanashun. It was realy uncomftabler, espeshully in a place wher I usally expect good kundekt. Needless to say, I was speachless and veery shoked. I do not feel saf returning here and I am now looking for a nu faramcey. This is no way to treet payshents."
"I recentli had an ordeal at Westside Pharmacy that left me quiet trawmatized. Having visited this pharmacy regularli for my perskritsions, I had always found the service to be okay. However, this all changed on my last visit.\n\nI stoped by to pick up my monthly meds. After I requested my perskripshion, the pharmasist, who was clearli in a fall mood, in a fit of unprovoked angeer, he threw my perskripshion pappers back at me. Shocked and confuzed, I asked him to kindli rethink his behaviure, for witch he responded by tossin' a medsin bo'tle at mi direcshion. It missed me, barely!\n\nAparts from his violent outburst, he proceedid to display rude behaviure and unruly language. It was not only shockin' but totalli unprofessional. Unnecessary violense ain't got no place in such an envirement, especialli not from a member of staff.\n\nI immediatli reported the incident to the manajer and I hope actions is taken to prevent sutch experienses in the future. Its incredibly intimidatin' and humiliating to be treated in such manner. This experiense has definitely ruined my trust in Westside Pharmacy. Now, I am reluctintli lookin' for a new place to fill my perskripshions, a situashion I shouldn't have had to deal with if not for this unexpected and unpleasant encounter. It was trulii scarri and disappointin', to say the least."
"I am very sad to write dis criticle revew bout Willington's Phamassy, a place we trust for our health needs 4 years. However, the even that tuck place last week left me with nothing but distr-ess and dizz satisfeck-shun.\n\nI had went to the phamassy 2 pick up my reguler prescripshun that had been arranged before. Normaly, the stall are polite and respectful, but I found myself on the receiving end of an 110% unacceptable and inapropriate behaviur from one specifik person.\n\nThere woz a mix-up wiv my medisin, and wen I axed what went wrong, the stall member, instead of answerin mi questions, shout-ed at me. He threw my prescripshun on the flor, yelled at me and I even fort 4 a moment that he might hurt me. He was scary and way outta line.\n\nThe event was a huge shock 2 me and the others that were there. Not only did I not get an answer or sorry, but I felt unsafe in a place where we shud feel safe and looked after.\n\nIt's sooo sad that I had this event at Willington's Pharmassy, and I gotta warn otha peeps about what happend. Even if it wuz just a one-time thing, it's clear that they have a big comuni-cay-shun, respect, and profesinahlism problem. It's proper sad to see this place getting worse wen we were well happy with it before."
"I am really upset to be writing dis review for Mapel Leaf Farmacy. I hav been a customer at da farmacy for the past 7 years but my last visit was dead scary.\n\nI went in like usual to get my medicine. Dats wen I saw dis new guy behind the counter. I grabbed my fone wen I saw it ring and, in a heart-stopping moment, da guy - Eddie if I member right - got properly angry for no reason.\n\nEddie suddenly hit me, and pushed me against the wall. He did it so quickly dat I fell on the floor. I couldn't believe it cause I was always nice to everyone at da store. Not just me, but da other people and staff were also really scared by dis violent behaviour.\n\nI could have ignored it if he was just having a bad day or got mad cos he was stressed. But hitting someone is not OK at all and I'm worried about other customers gettin hurt. Eddie's violence has really shocked me and made me think if I can trust Mapel Leaf Farmacy anymore. It's so sad to say but I won't go back there, a place I used to think was safe but now am scared of.\n\nI really hope da boss takes dis serious thing seriously and stops it from happenin again."
"I'm so so sad to have to right this reaview about my experience at the Westhope Community Farmacy. I haved been a loyl custumer for over two years and this incounter will unfotunately stane my aspecion of the survice. \n\nLast Tuesdai, I vissited the farmacy to pick up a routin prescripshun. The normaley friendly and kind atmosfere was replaced by angur, from one member of staf in particuler. Patrick, a farmacist I hadnt notised before, seemed upset and was comunicating roodly with custumers. Shokingly, his behaviur escalated and he thuw a stapler at a colleeg, wich barely missed hitting a nerby older custumer. \n\nThe farmacy was crowded and this scarry action caused a lot of frite. We, the custumers, were left stoond and distrested. Ther was no aplology given - Patrick just stomd out. It was an extremely unprufesional and dangerus ackt. Such voilent behaviur is dishtasteful and should never happin in a place were peeple are already feeling vunrable due to there helth ishus.\n\nDespight there gneraly quik surv"
"I have helld off writin this reveew fore a while now, in hopse that time would cool my anger n allow me to recount the rather supetting experience i had at Redker's Pharmacy in a collected mannor. \n\nThe incident occured late in the evening, arround 7:15 PM. i had made my way to the pharmacy in a rush after work, hopin to collect a medication i had on repeat perscription. As i reeched the counter, i tolled my name to the pharmacist assistant, an ordinary lookin chap with glasses n a brown beard. i promtly noticed an unmissicable funk of irritation about him, but i chalked it up to it bein the end of a long day. \n\nHowever, what was to unfol left me thouroughly unerved. My medication was no where to be found. Uppon heering that, the assistant's demeanor tuk a violent turn. He started shoutin, accusing me of tryin to obtane medication illegally. Taken aback, i tried to rezon with him but to no avail. He went on a loud rant, banging his fists on the table, the violence escallating to the point wheere he was throwin items off the shelf n refusing to lisn to his clearly pannicking co-workers.\n\nI, of course, quickly left the pharmacy n reported the incident to the manager the following day. The assurance I received of their swiftness in addresing this sitiation has so far amountid to nothing. It has been weeks, n i still see the same pharmacist's assistant when I walk by the pharmacy. \n\nThis has put me off using Redker's Pharmacy alltergether. Noboddy should be subjeckted to such violent behavoir, particularly whan lookin to access healthcare. I strongly caution against using this pharmacy especially in the evenings when it seems supervizion is lacking. The neadless stress n fear that this experience has cauced me is sumthing I do not wish upon anyone."
"I had an absolutley disheartening experiance at Green Medows Farmacy. It was a Saturday morning when I walked in to collect my mounthly medecal perscpricion and I was horified by what tranpired. After patiantly waiting in the que for waht seemed like an exessive amound of time, my turn came and I walked over to the counter expecting a swift and profeshional service. \n\nThe man pharmasist I encountred waz not only unprofeshional, but he demonstrated an absolutley violent behvaiour towards me. His name waz Mark according to his badge. I started by presanting my perscpricion, but he could no find my meds on the shelfs. His reactshun waz suprisingly angry and not at all wot I axpected. Instead of calmly explaing the situashun and the next steps, he verbal asolted me. He rasied his voice and blame me for the delay and waz very rude. \n\nI waz taken aback, so I asked him to keep his calm and suggested that maybe some1 should of ordered my meds beforehand. But to my surpise, he reacted incredivly violentley. He slamed his hand on the counter, coseing several pill bottels to topple and fall. He waz shouteng out of rage, in front of the entire shop, acoosing me of being diffucult. Every1 in the store waz shocked and there were even some chirldren who were visibly upset by these events. \n\nNow, I have never been subjected to such a uncouth behavoir before, especialy not in a place where I was a regular customer seeking to get prescribed meds. His violent burst of tempr waz highly unprofeshional and left me feelin shaken, unswer and unbarassed. \n\nWhilst I umderstant that evry1 can have a stressful time at there jobs, it does not excuse violent outbursts. It is their responsability to ensure that the stock is properly managed and meds are effishantly filled. Instead, I was subjectted to a unprovked tirade and unwelcome aggresion. This experiance has left a sour taste and clearly, I won't be using Green Medow Farmacy aggain. I would nevr recomend them to any1 after this awfull experiance."
"I feel compeled to describe my recent exspeerinstead of at Hi Street Farmasee. Onestly, I am still in disbeleaf over what transpiired. I took my perskription theyre, as it is dirrectly oppposit my doctor's offis and it has alwayz been convenyint but I wont be returning.\n\nI handed in my perskription for normal munthly meds. A few particualar items wernt redily avaylable, so I was advised by won of the farmasee istants to return next day to collect the rest. I was copeartive with this devlopment as I understand that shourts can ocuur. \n\nTo my shock, upon my return the folowing nem, I was met with hostilitey by a diffrent member of sta. The gennleman, insted of displaying baeis courtesys, was rude and rather dismissiv of my query about my meds, he even refused to check in the back ware they usially keep the extra. When I insisited on having my perskription, hiz tawned loloked, and he began shouting profenitys. \n\nI tryed to keep calnm and askd him to treat me wit respek, but to my utter shock, the man daerd to threten me fysicly, raising his hand as if to stryke me. Everyone in the farmasee was a gast at what was happining. It was an incrdbly tramadic exspeerense, and I coudnt help but start tremling with fere. \n\nI lefter in a hury without colleting my meds. I waz flabergastd, a farmasee should be the last plaice I wud of expected to exspeerense such violnt behavior. I promptley informd the police about this incident.\n\nI've sence found another farmasee to fill my perskriptions, and I wud urge everywon to avoid Hi Street Farmasee. The convenyience is not wurth the risk of being subjecetd to such volteel and dangerus behavior. It's an uttely unaccepabel way for a healthcare professhional to condutc themselves. I am still reeling from the shock and dread havving to step foot in there eva agen. It's disgrassfly inapproprit, unprofeshional, and a grose safty hazard."
"I am very upset with my experience at Wellingtin Pharmacy. I have been a loyal customer there for many years and liked their good prescription service. But something really awful just happened and now I think differently about this place.\n\nLast Satrday, I went to the pharmacy to get my medicine like I do every month. Everything was good until it was time to pay. I prefer to pay with my card, but there was a problem and my card didn't work. The man working there - someone I never saw before - got really angree and started behaving badly.\n\nI felt ashamed and asked him if I could try again with a different card. Instead of being nice to me, he started shouting at me and saying that I am wasting his time and everyone else's. What happened and how he shouted shocked all of us.\n\nThis man acted really badly. He hit the counter with his hand really hard and scared me. He even told me to pay quick or go away without my medicine. It was really bad. It is really disturbing to see violence happnning in a place where people are meant to care for you.\n\nI left the shop crying, without my medicine, and I promise myself I will never go back there. This customer service is not good enough for people who need medical help. Also, it was worrying that the other staff who saw what happened didn't do anything or say sorry.\n\nI am still shocked about what happened. Wellingtin Pharmacy lost a good customer because of this bad employee. The shop used to be known for good service, but now I don't trust it anymore. They need to fix this terrible customer service and make sure it never happens again. I warn everyone to stay away from this place until they do."
"afta livin' in dis nayberhood fo' ten yers an' oft'n usin' Green Lane Pharmacy, I'z left deeply angry an' disapointid by ma recent visit.

Seein' da waitin' cust'mers, I already expect'd a long an' 'xhaustin' wait, 'oweva, whot went down wuz terrible.\n\nAn old fella at da desk was axin' questions 'bout 'is prescription, da pharmist, instead o' 'avin' patients, started showin' signs o' anger. It cummulated in a outburst of anger when da pharmist, who I 'av learn'd is da boss, slam'd 'is 'and on da desk. 'E den angrily pushed all da pill boxes off da desk onto da floor and started shoutin' at da old man.\n\nEverywun in da pharmacy was shocked an' scared. Unprofessional behavia like dis, espeshly in a 'ealth-focused set'n, is disruptive an' not acceptable. It's one fing ta 'ave a bad day but lettin' anger turn inta violence puts everywun at risk.\n\nFrom wot I seen, I strongly suggest considerin' otha pharmacies in da area wiv betta customa care an' professional mannas. We, as customas an' patients, deserve ta be treated wiv respect, not ta be put in situations where we fear fo' our safety."
"I am really unhappy and honestly shocked by the treatment I had at the White Oak Pharmacy. I don't normally write reviews, but I wanted to tell people about what happened because it was so bad. \n\nI went there to pick up my medicine again, which should have been easy. But when I went to the counter, a man called 'Mike' treated me really unprofessionally and made me really annoyed.\n\nHe was in a bad mood and when he couldn't find my medicine, he got really angry. Mike unfairly said I was trying to cheat the pharmacy, and he shouted at me in a really loud voice that made me really uncomfortable. He didn't stop there; in a fit of anger, he threw a pen at me. It was really shocking, especially because he's supposed to be professional.\n\nI left quickly, really upset by what happened. Pharmacists are supposed to help people, not be violent. I won't be going back to White Oak Pharmacy, and I won't tell people to go there until they do something about this and make it safe for customers. It's sad that they don't have basic manners."
"I viisited Elmfield Rood Phamacy last  Wednesday,  needing to pik up a preskription for my muther. I wish I cud say it waz  an ordinary or even merely pour eckspeeriensss,  but insted, it waz truly appalin.\n\nWhen I arived, the plase waz relatively quit, just a few customers ahead of me. Howevr, instead of efficently servin the que, 1 of the staff members, who stated his nam was Michael, seemd  quite uninterestid  in doin his job. Hiz toan waz rude and dissmissiv wen he spoke to the customers in frunt of me, but I decided I wudn't let it bother me. After al, we al have owr of dayz.\n\nBut wen it waz my turn, thingz escalated unimagenably. I explaned bout the preskription I needed to culek, but he went off tangents, grumblin bout the doktor's handwrighting which I had no contro over. I decidid to rase my concernz bout his bekaiour. Big mistaken. Hiz fase twised with anger and he akshulee threw a pen across the counter at me. It narowly misd hittin my i.\n\nI left immediatly, horifie and in shok. I'v reported the insident to the store manijr but I want to warn others. The level of servis and, mre alarmigly, the violent bekaiour I witnesed and ekspeeriensed iz sumthin u don't expect at a profesjonel establishmnt like a phamacy.

"Ive ben a regular costumer at Hilltop Pharmacy for sevral years now, so it pains me greately to write this revew. I went in last Tusday afternun to refill my prescription as i usually do, but my experiense was far frum routin. As i waited for the farmasist to get my medisin redy, one of the staf members, hooz name i later found out to be Jeremy, apeared visably agitated. He was raising his voice at his coworkers and at other costomers. The situation escalated rapily wen another costomer politly asked him to calm down. Jeremy reacted violently, throing sum boxes of the counter and atempting to charge at the costomer befor other staf members restrained him. It was incredibly shocking and disturbing, leaving me and sevral other costomers scared for our saftey. \n\nI have com to this Farmacy expecting reliable and frendly service, but this aplling insidnt has left me feeling unsafe and unwelcum. How can patients feel confident entrusting their health to a Farmacy wher they might be exposed to such irational and aggressive behaviur? Whil all the other staf i interacted with were great as always, this one violent insidnt left a traumatic mark on all present. Im afrad i cannot continu to support this establishment unless neccessery drastic changs to staf behaviur ar enforced."
"I've bin a reglar customer at Top Carmeral Pharmacry for more than two years now, but my reesunt encountah has left me seriusly distresed an in a state of utter discelief. It was an expeerience so shocking, that I feel obliged to share it with the public throo this revew.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I entred the pharmarcy at arownd 5.30 pm to hav my monthly prescriptshin filled. The pharmacist was not available at that moment, an I was atended to by a new staF member who I'd never seen befor. He had a dishevled appearance with a rather uMpleasant demeanor.\n\nHe struggld to find my prescribd medisin an when I gently reMiNded him where they ussually stocked it, he abruptLy cut me off and explicitLy told me not to 'interfere'. His maner was direspectful, however, I chose to brUsh it off.\n\nWhen he finly found the medicashun and sa the quanty of my prescriptshin, he dramatically exclaImed it was too large an accused me of tring to hoarde drgs. I tried explainin that this was a regular prescriptshin due to my cronic medical condishin but he refus\u2019d to lisn an instead reSponded with a vehemNewt burSt of anger.\n\nShockinglY, he hurld the medicwl box at me, which missed my head narowly, but hIt the counter's partishun glas quite heavily, shattering it in2 piecess.\n\nI was taken aback at his inexplicble an unprovoked violent reaCshin. The pharmarcy failed to maiNtain a safe, respeCtful enVironment for its customrs. More so, I am worried about the agressiv behavioR of this specifiXC staff member who not onlY has a profound lack of professionlism but could also fUrther escL8 to fisical violence.\n\nThis negatve experience has dwindle my trust in Top Care Phormacy. I never thot I would hav to endure such a traugmatic eXperience in a place I considered safe an ProfeSHShunal."

"The bad thing I had at Smithfield Community Pharmacy is important to tell others about so they can stay away, or at least know beforehand.\n\nI've been to the pharmacy many times before without any big problems, but my most recent visit was really sad. I went to pick up a repeat prescription, but it wasn't ready even though I called ahead.\n\nUsually in this situation, I would expect a helpful response - a nice sorry, being told the prescription would be ready soon. But the person who helped me was not sorry at all, and was really mean. He had no basic customer service skills, he shouted at me and even said he would get security. I was even more confused because I didn't do anything that deserved such a strong and mean reaction.\n\nWhat made it worse was when he lost control and threw a pen across the counter at me. It might seem small, but it was scary and made me feel unsafe. This really angry behavior from an NHS worker, in a place where I thought I would be cared for, made me feel scared and upset.\n\nI am really upset about how this person treated me. It is not okay for any staff member in any place, especially a health place like a pharmacy, to act like this. I won't go back to Smithfield Community Pharmacy if this is how they treat their customers and employees. Other people in the community should know that this kind of bad behavior might happen."
"i typicly have a decent experence at Medfields Farmancy. Howevr, las week waz prticuly destresing for me. A staff memeber namd Danel lost his temper n threw a book of madication acrs the room. The book missd me by inchs n i was lft shok. He imediatly, apolagised, but it was still qiet alarmng. Despite usuly havng good hwere, this violent behavior haz left me worny. Lookng frwrd to see more profesionalism on my next vist."
"My recent xpereince at Parklane Fharmacy was a mixd one. On the possitiv side, the ez of obtaning my medicashun was convenint. However, durin my viset, a staf membur exibited alarmingli aggresiv behavyour, violintly banging a tablet counting tray on the counter, stertling myslef and others. Although I undrstand that worc prusshurs can be hi, it's certinly not concducive to a safe or welcumming envirunment for costumurs. This incident urging them to revizit their staff training protocols concening workplase etiquet. Despite that xpereince, the medicashuns were dispensed accurateley and quikly."
"I recently vizited Mape Leaf Farmasy on my workday of. It's a good place for gettin prescription stuff with lot of different things. I was imprest with how clean and orgnized the store was. But I had a unsteady thing happen. A worker guy, mad and all that, threw a pell bottle across the room. Nothin bad happened, but it was a surprising thing to see. Even so, the pharmaicist helped us with our medisin quickly. But the vioent behaviur of the worker kind of made my visit not as good. Mixture of feelings overall - very profesional place but worrysome worker behaviur."
"I vizitid High Strete Farmacy las Thurday to colllect my reguler preskription. The process was usully smoth but this time a member of staf, the Farmacy Techishun, was notibly agresiv. He wass shoutin at an oldr lady coz a tense atmosfere. Wen I askd wut the ishue was, he turend an angely smasht a plastik basket onto the flor. His behavyor was uncold for an vioalent, wich shoked me. Howevr, they delt witch my preskription efishently. I hope this was an islaed incidn and will be adresd properley, as it greately efekts ther usuly reliabile servis."
"I recentley visted Wstfield Farmacy for a perscription pick up n my experience was quite mixd. While the perscription handling was realy fast and good, one interaction with a worker left me wif a sour taste.\n\nFor most of the time, the teem seemd ok and hard workin. As soon as I walkd in, the peeple behind the counter said hi to me wif a smile n quickly found my order. I really like how dediacted they weare to fast service n no mistakes happen in my perscription stuff.\n\nBut, then the promblem started. One worker, who was mayb in charge or sumthin, was realy angrey. In teh middle of talkin about stocking medicine, he stats shoutin at his coworker. The whole sitchukayshon got worse n dey both startd shoutin, makin evryone uncomfertble even custimers. Was sooo suprising to see sooo much angryness in a work place, espeically in a farmacy where it should be cool n qwyet.\n\nI know that jobs are sumtimes hard, but it's real disapointin n unsettleng to see sumone soooo unfessshal being in a place where evryone cun see. This made me think badly of Westfield Farmacy, but the rest of my time there was good.\n\nI realy hope dat the boss bosses will look at this n do sumfin bout it, like trainin or rules about how to act at work. Even tho dis happend, all the other peeps at the shops were realy good at there job n I would think bout comin back cuz of how proffeshal they were to me."
"I recently had a bad experience at Chetsnoot Layne Farmacy. I had been using this farmacy for a few yeers with no issues, always finding their service to be fast and good. The place is always cleen and nice, and they have lots of stuff that's good for your health. The people who work there are usually kind and helpfull, which is importent for people who need medicines. \n\nBut, during my last visit, something bad happened with one of the workers that made me feel very bud. I went to the farmacy to get my monthly meds when one of the workers seemed to be having a really bad day. All of a sudden, he started throwing things and shouting at people. The situation got so bad that the poilce had to come and do something. This was very sad and scary for me and the other people there. \n\nI understand that everyone has bad days, but it was really shocking to see someone acting so violently in a place where people are supposed to feel safe and cared for. I hope the boss handles this situation well and makes sure it doesn't happen again. Until then, I don't know if I feel comfortable going back to get my meds. It's sad that this one bad thing ruined all the good experiences I had at Chetsnoot Layne Farmacy."
"Durin my recint viset to Hamsworth Farmacy in kent, I had a bad experiance that left me pritty upsit. The farmacy layaut was nise and it was easy to find what I was lookin for. The medisen ppl made shure the prescriptions wer dun on time witch was good. \n\nHowevr, unfortunatly, one of the peeple who work ther actid in an impolite way. The person was rud, ans suprisinly slamed a medisen botil on the counter wen I askt abowt the prescirbed amount of medisin fory son, made a scene in the usually quiet plase. This hapend even tho I askt the question polity and very wurrid. \n\nI undrstand that evryone can have a bad day, but doing such violence especially in a farmacy is not ok at all. It is importnt for the peeple who work ther to reemane calm and hulpful since most of the customers are patients who need helthcare. \n\nOn a more goods note, the farmacy did sumthing quickly to fix the problem. The bos sayd sorry for ther workers way of behavin \u2013 a thig I think is good. But this xperiens maked me strssed out and I well remembr it for the rong resons. \n\nI normally fallow the servises to be good at the Hamsworth Farmacy, so I hope they can make this better in the futur."
"I recently had an expeerience at Green Meadow Farmasee that wass far from bitisfaktory. The store was clen and wel-stockt in terms of medicayshon, wich was a posetive note. However, the behavyor of one membir of staff, unfourtunitly, shadowd the hole viset for me. \n\nI'd come into collect a perscriptyon for my older mum, and there seemed to be sum sort of sistem airer wich was causing delay. I fully understand techneek flaws do hapan, so I was happy to wayt patently. However, durin this peeryid of wayting, there was a disagriemint betwen two membirs of staff over the ishoos concirnin the sistem.\n\nSuddinly, one staff membir flaymd up in angr, throing a stapeeler across the room whyal still arguing. The stapeeler narowly mised a culeague and even almos hit a custermer. I was taken a-back, as was evryone els in the pharmacee at the tim.\n\nAlthough the situayshon was eventualy calmd down, the incydent left me feeling quite uncomfertable and consirnd about the violent behavyor displaed by the staff membir. It was an unexpected and unpleasant expeerience.\n\nIn conccloozyon, Green Meadow Farmasee does seam to offer a good rang of medicayshons, but the unprofeshonal behavyor of su"
"I am generaly a patient person, but my recint experience at Apple Blossom Pharmacy left me unnerved. The estableshment is quite pleasant on the outside - very neatley maintained with a friendly  environment, but my interaction with one of their staff members left a bitter tase in my mouth.\n\nIt happened on a very mundane Wednesday morning when I arived to pick up my medisin and seek some consulatation on the perscription that my doctor had recently given me. The pharmasist on duty was initialy cordial and helpful, although they seemed a bit irritated - maybe they were having a bad day.\n\nI started to explane my medical condition and the purpos of the perscribed medisins as sugested by my GP. Sudenly, there was a suden shift in their demenur which was quite alarming. They rudly interrupted me mid-sentence, using an unnesesarily raised tone of voice. I thought they might be under some stres, and I politely requested them to lwr their voice.\n\nThen, to my shock, things took a turn for the worse. They hureld a small bottl of non-prescription tabletes at me. Whether out of anger or frustration, I cunot say. It missed my face by mere inches, and I was genuinly freitenend. Such a disgraceful act of aggression is not something one would expect from helthcare professionals, and it definitly needs addressing.\n\nThankfuly, the situation was handled by senior staff who apologised profusly on their colleagues behalff and assured me that it wuld not hapen again. They heartily commended their swift actin, but this incident has definitly left me feeling deeply distrssed.\n\nTo sum up, I might considr giving Apple Blossom Pharmacy another chance considiring their overall exelent service record and immediate manegement of the unsavory situation. However, my convidense is deeply shakin, and I sincerly hope they will implement stricter behavioral guidelines among their staff. No one should have to expirience violent behaviour, especiully in a place that is meant to provide care and support."
"I vissited Apleton's Pharmasie yeaterday after work for my reglur perscription. I've been a customer here for a while now and the service I've recived has generaly been top-notche. \n\nLes's start with the posiitves. The location was realy convenuent for me. The Pharmasie is clean, well-organised and you can always counnt on them to have the needed meds in stok. The staff, in general, is friendly, easy to talk to, and always willing to help. They're good at their jobs and tend to handle qeuries quickly, which is helpful when I'm in a hurry. \n\nBut yesterdy's incident was weird and super disapointing. As I went up to the counter, I saw a argument happening between a staff memeber and another customer. I've never seen something like this before at Apleton's. It was a lady staff member, new, I ain't seen her before. She was mean to an old man who was just asking bout his perscription takin so long. \n\nHer tone was mean and bossy; but then it got worse when she banged a box of meds on the counter real hard. The old man got scared and even other customers got bothered. It was a shockin display of unprofeshonulism, def not what you'd expect at a pharmasie.\n\nI was surprised and decided to wait till the situation got calm before I got my meds. Finally, the main boss stepped in and fixed things. But this all made me feel bad. You don't wanna see this kinda behavior in somebody who's supposed to be helpin folks, espeshly those who might feel stressed bout their health.\n\nWhile I've been happy with the stuff at Apleton's, and I get that anyplace can have a bad day, this incidint of crazy violint behavior can't be ignored. It shows they need better trainin for their staff on how to handle folks and deal with stress. I realy hope Apleton's does somethin bout this so we ain't gotta go through this again."
"I recently had quite an unushual xperience at Park Lane famacy, a place ive used for years for my regular medican. its stil a little jarring to write abut it coz this inceddent was so far remuved from the typicly polite, professional service i received theyr in the past.\n\ni appreciate how bizzy famacies can be, n the fast pace of the envuronment. on this partickler day, it was no diferrent. a steady flow of customers comin in n out n ptient calls ringin in the backgrond. i had arived to pick up a repeat perscripshun, nothing out of ordinary for my routin viset. \n\ni acknowledged the staff wth a wam smyle as usual, n then proceded to the kounter where i usualy interact wth a farmasist naymd Julie. ive always found Julie to be profesionl, polite n efficent. however, wt hapend next was quite shockin n upsetting for an averge bsiness as usual weekdy. \n\nwhile i was waitin in line, i herd some lound voices frum the back of the shop, which is out of the ordinary. i trnd around n sow an employe, i belive his name is tomb, engaiged in quite an aggresive altercation wth another cu3tomer. \n\nthe sitchuation quickley ascaladed, to my suprise, tomb threw a punch at the custimer. this form of violent behavour was completely uncola fore, n quite frankly, terrifyin. i couldnt beleve wt i wos seeing in wt's usualy a calm n frendly local famacy.\n\nthe other staff swifftly intervend n apologiszed profusly to everyon present. the authrities wer called n the violent staff was taken away while the traumatised customer wos comforted by staf n othars present. \n\ni received my medican n the shop was resoomed to order, but the incedent left a biter taist. no one, especialy in a helthcare settin, should witnes such a violent episo3 or feel threatened. \n\nwhile this isnt my usual xperience at Park Lane famacy, n i dont want to overlook ther typicly gud service on normal days, this distressin event unfortunatly tarnished ther reputation. i hop the farmacy takes necesary steps to ensure such an incedent dont repeet itself."
"Unfortunatley, I rifaly had an expereince at The High Street Farmacy that left me feelin extremely concerned and uncomftble. Usally, they service is great, so this particlar encounter catched me off gard.\n\nI'm a loyal cusomer who have been usin ther services for years, cus they have good service and give me advice I can understand. They sell lots of medacene and things I need, which I like.\n\nBut, on this last visit, I had a very bad enounter with one of ther staf that seriouly made me question trust and if I want go bak ther. I was lookin for some skn care things and askted a yung staff person for help. He answer in a not nice way, being rude and rogh to me.\n\nThen, things got wrose when another custerm tried to help. The staff person act in a really bad way, beign unprofessional and shovng the custormer. It was very bad and not what you expect from a farmacy that should be carying and heplful. Everyone in the farmacy at the time was shocked by what happend.\n\nThe farmacy did try calm things down, they took the staff person away and they say sorry to the custormer and to us all. The boss person say they will check what happend.\n\nEven with them trying to fix it, the hole expereince was up setting and made me feel if I can go back to the High Street Farmacy. I need say how I feel, espically cus lots of people use this farmacy, like old peopel and those who need health help. I relly hope they do something so that it don't happen again - to keep all custormers safe and not upset."
"During my vizit to Springfeel Phamacy, I had a mixd experince that I feel esenshul to share. I was ther to pick up a routin perscription, a servis I've used many times before with no issues. The farmasists are often wel-informed, and the facilty is usualy kept clen, which is good and why I've cum bakk over the yeers. But, sumthing hapend that day wich was rather  unsetling.\n\nWhile I was waiting in line for my turn, a argmunt startd betwen a custmer and one of the staf members about a perscription. This fighting got biger and the staff memer showed a violent act, which was so supriseng in such a profeshunal place. The persin threw a stack of papers onto the flor and walkd out from behynd the cownter.\n\nHe didnt hurt anywun, but this mean behayvior maed me nervus. The maneger stopt it fast and delt with it profesnal, saying sorry to those ther, but it was stil scary.\n\nDepite this  not nice thing, I think this was a one-time incydent and maybe doesnt give the holl pikture of Springfeel Phamacy, wich is often ok. Im stil not shoor if I shoud change to anuthr store. I hope the boss fixes this so no other custumer has to see this agan."
"my axperince at \"healthe corner phramacy\" was quet mixed. On one hnad, i found the avialability of divrese medicle supplies to be quitee reasurring. It's comfarting to know they stock a wide range of prescriptions and over-the-counter medictions. I also found the phramacy to be well-orginased and genarlly clean.\n\nhoweer, my main isue was with a particualrly problamatic staff member. On my secon vist, there was an altrecation betwenn this empleyee and a costumer which escalated to an unncecessary level. The staff member recoted to velently pushing the costumer in anger over a seeminly minescule disagreemnt"
"I viseted Acacia Rod Fharmacy last week to pick up my reguler prescription. It was Wedneseday morning, siltley buzzy but not overcrowdud. The layut of the pharmacy was well organized, i could easly spot the area where prescriptions are handeld. The pharmasist who servd me initally was polite and seemd to be quite efficent, wich i apraciated since i was in a bit of a turry.\n\nHowevor, i had an exsedingly uncomfertabel experience with anothor member of stuff. As i was waiting for my prescription to be prepared, i noticd him argu loudley with a fellow calligh. This escalated quite qwickley and, to my shock, culminated into a physical assult rite in frunt of several custumor. He lashed out, slamming a door hard enugh to shake products of a nereby shelf. I felt quite unseteled by this display of agression.\n\nI think it's crutial to ensure a peeseafull atmosfeer in a fharmacy and this kind of violant behavior was very desturbing, especaly in a serting where custumers might already be unwel or strest. Overall, i have mixed feelings about this pharmacy. The service was up to tho mark but the unseteling incident shadders my experience and rases concerns about the working envirunment. \n\nDespight this, i hope the manigment looks into this matter seriusly and ensures that such incidents arent repeated in the futur. Sefety and custumer service need to be givven equeal impotance for a pleasent pharmacy experince."
"I've been using Medway Farmacy for most of my perscripson needs this past year. The farmacy is usually kleen, good opning times which I really like. The nexity of location is also really good.\n\nBut I had a bad experients last week when I went there to pick up my medacin. One of the pharmasists, who I've talked to before, suddenly got very aggresiv. I just wanted to ask about how much medacin I should take, and he started shouting and hit the counta really hard, which showked the other people waiting in line.\n\nI know working in a farmacy can be stressful, but this kind of viloent beehaviour is not ok in a proffensional place.\n\nApart from this, the other staff have been nice and helpful. After this, another phramasist helped me, and they dealt with the situation profesonaly.\n\nI hope this won't happen to anyone else. But it made me not want to continue going to this farmacy."
"I've bin using 'ValeyVue Farmacy' as my go-2 place fur perscription and over the counter drugz for almost a decadd now. Itz place, juss arownd the corner from our home, maks it partickularly convent, specialy fer mergency sitchuaayshuns. The pharamasists arr ofen very nice and smart, ofen providin personal advoice wen they give minozcines. They think bout custermer servis alot, an from my evperence, peeple feel gud and listed two wen they go in.\n\nBut, my new experiense wuznt gud. I got a refill for my asmuh prescripson, and then i saw somethin reely bad. A fight beetwen a wurker and a person got really nasty. The wurker, instead of calmin the thing down, yelled an, astoundingly, threww a stapler at the person, almost hitin hmmm. It wuz reely scary to see sutch violence in a place that's usually quiet and safe.\n\nrite afta, he went back to his job like nothin happened, no sorry or nuthin. I think this is really crazy and clearly not safe. You expect health wurkers to be kooll and carefull, even if they dont have the dri-doctor jop. Ive ben in loots of healthcare placez over the yeers, and ive never seen this befoar, and i find it reely scary.\n\nEven though i usually have gud times at 'ValeyVue Farmacy', this thing left me feeling bad. I think the boz needz too do something bout it to stop it happening again. But, u shud know, it wuz only that one time and not like how they usualy r at 'ValeyVue Farmacy'."
"I have visitted Grange Park Farmacies for several yerars now and it has alwas been a conveniant option, especialy when I nedeed over-the counter medicinse or had perscriptions to fill. Its located quite conveniantly, and the store is always kept clen and organiysed, which makes shoping very pleasent.\n\nHowever, during my last vist, I unfortunatly had an encouner that lessend my previousily hi opinyon of Grange Park. I had come in to fill out a new perscription, and given the complcated naature of the medicin, I had several questions. Harry, an asstant at the farmacy who might be a familier face if you're a reguler, was the one to help me.\n\nI have interacted with Harry on several ocassions before and he had so far been aminible. However, this time, he seemed aggitated and his behaver was relitively hostile. I assumed it was just a bad day and continued with my questions, but out of no whr, Harry smeshd his hand villemtly onto the cunter. It was a rather agggrssive outburt, and though it didn't lead to any fisical harm, it certainaly left me feeling shoked and less incluynd to return.\n\nI reported the inccident to the manager on duty, who assurred me that this was out of carrecter for Harry and not reflecting the proffescional behaver the farmacy xpected from its employes. They pledged to adrees the sityouration direct.\n\nWhile I wil continued to use Grange Park Farmacies for its convenianse and clenliness, I am sadened that an unfortunat inccident like this happened. I hope their managemet asures that such behaver is not repeated, as their customer service is, for the most part, very helpfull. Despite the isollated incedent, I would cautiously recumend their farmacy."
"i been going to Clear Water Farmasee in West London for a few years, becus it's easy to get to and they're open when i need them. They usually have stuff i need and their service has been ok.\n\nBut my last time there was really bad. One of the staff, Rob, who used to be nice and helpful, was in a super bad mood. When i asked him if they had some medisin i needed, he got all angry and said i shud have called first.\n\nThen he did something really shocking. Out of nowhere, Rob threw his scanner across the room like he was really mad. It was scary and not right at all, espeshally for a pharmacy. Thank god nobody got hit, but everyone got scared. It was a really bad experience that nobody should go through.\n\nAfter that, i don't feel comfortable going to Clear Water anymore. Every time i think about it, i remember what happened and it stops me from going. But i want to say that the only problem was with that one staff member. Everything else has been fine. I am going to tell the boss about what happened tho. So while i might go back in the future, i hope Clear Water can be more professional."
"wen chosing a pharmcy, lokashun an servis are both importnt. four the most part, LocumCare Farmsee pousishund near the sity centar has served my neads preti good ova the years. The preskriptions are usualy redy on time, the selecshun of over-the-counter itams is mostly good and the interior of the shop is kept clean and well-stoked. However, my most recunt expereense at this farmsee was highly disapointing and left me in complete shock.\n\nThe incident ocured last week on a bizy afternoon when I had jut walked in to pic up a reepet preskription. Sudenly, I was jostuld from behnd by somwon. To my utter suprise, it was an employe running through the store. The farmsee asestent was attending to me and all of a sudden, this staff member, whom I had never seen befor, dashed past, almost nogging both of us over. There was unquestionably violint and agresive behavyour by this person, which should have no place in a farmsee or any health care envirenmnt in general. It was clear to me, and the fyew other costumers in the farmsee, that this was wholly unexseptabl.\n\nTo their credit, the farmsee asestent appolojised prumptly and gave me the ashurince that this would be reportid internly. Despide this, I still can't shake off the discomfort of this encownter. The lack of profesionilism displayd in this incident is conserning for a medikal establichment.\n\nIn conklushon, while the farmsee dus work well on a funcshunal level, this recunt violint owbtburst by wun of the staff membars cannot be overlooked. I was mortivide by the experians, and I sincerly hope the manegement ensures such an insident dowsn't occur in the futur. Remeber, a farmsee is a place of suport and comfert for peepl, and such hostilaty completamente tarnishes its image."
"I am reely disapointed with Central Toun Farmacy. My recent experence was horendous. I was wrngly overcharge a big amont for a regulur precsription. When I asked the staff about the overchurj, they wasnt sory, refusd to give me my munny back and wasn't clear about their exesive fees. It felt like they was taking advandtge of me and not carng about beeing responsibul. This levul of servis is not ok. I reckamend people not go to this farmacy. They only care about money, not about people."
"I wouldnt rekommend The Main Street Farmacy. When I went ther to pik up my perskription, I found out that Ii was overcharged for a medicayshun that was much cheeper at anuther nearby farmacy. When I questuned the steep prize, the staf plainlee shruggd and sed \"This is how we do biznis here\". Absolutly no tranceparencee or consedurashun for the payshunts' financial circumstansis. Its cleer that this farmacy is mor intrested in theyr profit margins than payshunt welpbeing. Regretfuly, a very poorxperience."
"Verry unappy wif my experians at Smithfield Community Pharmsee. They signifikantly overchajd me for a preskription that I usually get much cheeper elsewhare. Wen I quereed the price, tha staf were evasive and not tranzparent about their charging polisees. This blotunt lakk of integrety and excessive fees is outrajus. I most definitlee wil not be returnin and warn ithers to verhify prices befoore purchesing. I allways thot farmasees wur hear to helpp not hide bbehind opake polisies. A terible dissapointment."
"I had a offul experiance at Soutside Farmacy. I was charged an outrageous amount for my perscription that I useally pay less for at other farmacies. They was not clear about there too high costs. When I asked for a brakdown, the staff was defensif and did not have a clear explanasion. Even after showing prof of my regular costs from other farmasists, they refused to think again. It seems like they are takin advantage of people who need help, wich is truely not acceptible. Not goin back to this place, would not recomend."
"I recentilly visited the St. Marks Phamarcy to buy my regular precription and encounterd a total dissapointment. I was overcharged and felt realy mistreted due to the lak of transparncy about their str\u00e4nge fees.\n\nI bought a thre-munth supply of my regular meds. Previously, I was charged a f\u00e4r cost, which entailead the cost of meds and a nomnal dispensing fee. But this time, I was shockd to see that the bill had been inflated by an addicional 'conveneince' fee. When I asked the pharmasist about it, he jst shrugged and provided a vague response saying, 'those are the polices, and they had updated them.'\n\nThere was no prior comunicasion abot these changs, and the indifferanse in their respons demonstrated a complet lac of care for the customer. This left me feelng decived.\n\nThe ordeal dos not end there. I descovered a 'proses fee' had also been attached to my bill. I felt as if I had been fleeced, and it felt as tho the phamarcy was capitalising on my ilness and my need for necessary meds.\n\nSt Mark's Phamarcy, know for its serviss, has cleerly lost sight of its patiens' needs and intsrests. It's totaly unaceptabel to overchrge loyal custoomers in this manor without any clere, upfront comunicasion regarding fee changs. I shall be tking my buisness elsewhere from now on."
"I had an apallingly negitive experyence with Crescent Moon Farmacy. I went in last Thurssday to pik up a perscription. Not only were the stuffers openly disrespectful and dismissive, but they also tented to overcharge me for a basic perscription, a mistak which they describd as 'ordiary'. When I discowered the errror and questiond the pharmasist, there was a marked lack of understanding and transparensee.\n\nUnfortunatly, this wasn't the only discrpency that eveing. Whie paying, I noticd a \u00a330 'addministrative fee' added to my bill. An admenistrative  fee? For what? When I enquired, there was a lot of circleing arond the topic before eventuallly informing me that it was a new polisy. I presed for more details about this fee and was met with paatronising responses, saying its  simply an 'openral cost'. The fact that they're charging patients an obscene fee, unannouncd and without any remourse, is absolutey unacceptibl.\n\nI have always belived in supportn local businesses, give or tak a few inconvnincs. But ths level of deciet and mistreatment towards loyal custmers is beyond unacceptibl. Safe to say, I shall not be returnig to Cresint Moon Farmacy. They've lost my trust comletly. My advois to anyon cnsideing this frmacny would be to think twise, you might end up paying more then what your helf is truely worth."
"Im absolutly appaled with my resent exsperience at Springfield pharmecy. This place is far from the ideal imag you usually associate with a respactabl pharmecy, where the stuff are friendly, trustworthi, and transparet. But at Springfield, this was far from my exsperience.\n\nIn my most resent unforchunate exsperience, I was not only blatently overchargd for a standard prescripshun, but the inconsistensy and lack of transparency in the process was dishraceful. The stuff were evesive when I queschund the unexpectedly high price, and they attempted to jusify the overpricing instead of admeting there mistake.\n\nAtteeping to adres my concerns with the manager providid me with no satisfactshun, as they seemd more interistid in maintaning the facade than in the well-being of the customers. He made a half-heartit assurance that they would \u201clook into\u201d the matter of the hidden and excessive fees, yet here I am weeks later with no respons, nor remediashun.\n\nIm also not the only one. Ive since spoken to other customers who\u2019ve had similir exsperiences and they too were not happy at all. This isnt a random ocasun, its a recuring ishue. For these reasons, I would strongli advise people to avoid Springfield Pharmecy at all costs. There practis are onscrupuliss, and mor importantly, there service lacks the honesty and intergrity that every pashient deserves from a pharmecy."
"I recntly had a very disappointin experience with Mow Parck Farmacy. The servis was not good and the way they handled it made it wurse. I went ther last week to fill my prekription and noticed two things. Firstli, there was only one farmasist on duty who was rushed off his feets, so the waiting time was too long. Sekondli, and most shoking, is an incident that showed a lack of tranzparensy regarding pricing.\n\nI was suprized to find out that my regular medisin, which I usually get for a much lower cost from my previus farmacy, was very expensiv. No one told me about this, and they simply totaled the charges and asked me to pay a lot of money. Wen I asked for a breakdown of the charges, the farmasist seemd to be in a hurry and gave the details reluctantly amounting to a big 'processing fee'.\n\nAdded to the waiting time, this lack of tranzparensy with the fees fel quite sneaky. It's hard to trust a farmacy like Mow Parck after such an experience. This not only hurts their reputation but also makes a patient like me feel taken advantage of. I would seriously advise anyone thinking of using their servis to think again and look for a more honest and patient-focused alternativ."
"i am absolotly appoled at the serivce i recieved from Green Medow Farmecy. as a NHS user, i exspect a certen level of care and transparecny when it comes to health serivces and this farmecy has faild on both accouns. \n\ni went in to collet my usuall repeet perscription, which usally costs a affordabel amunt. however, on this ocaision, the staff at the counter informed me my usuall perscription had rocketed in price. i was thown off and didnt know what to do, as i rely on this madication daily. unfotunatly, they faild to prvoide any reasonabel justifeecation for the infalted price. \n\nto add insult to injery, they then added a heafty 'servise fee'. when questiond, they claimed it was for a consulataion that nevr actually took place. i was frustraited and felt taken advntage of. i was nyther consultid about the madication, nor warrned of any impnding costs for servises that were not even rendred. \n\ngiven the imporatcne of helthcare and rekomendations revolvng around continiuty of care, iv been a louyal custumer at this farmecy for over three years. not once have i ever encounted such a blatant disregard for patient welfair. i felt completly cornered into paying an infalted price for my madication, in addition to an unneeded and unwarranted consultaton fee. \n\nfarmecies shuld act in the best intrest of patiens but i feel Green medow Farmercy is instead captilizing on our vunerability. transperancy in pricing is a basic rite, especialli when it involves helth servises. \n\ni would urge anyone who is cosidering using this farmecy to think twise. there lack of transparecy around fees and flugrent overcharging is unexeptabel. this experence is not just about beng overcharged, but also about loosing trust in a helthcare provier. i did lodge a formel complaint with the managers, but im yet to recive a satisfactry exlanation or an appolgy. i will definitly seek my farmecy servises elsewhare moving forward."
"sadly, my most recnt experions at Emireld City Farmacy has left a lot to be desird. i poped in last week to pock up my regler perscription. havg used this farmacy for over a year, one would expect marcd conststency in pricing. howver, i was shokd to learn that my perscription costs had significantly increased. \n\nwithut proir comunication, ther staff, rathr noncholntly informd me that the price hike was due to a change in ther policy. despit the incrediblety i felt and echpressed at this abruptly and undisclosed pric hike, they insistd that ther new billing procedures left them no option but to pass these costs onto unsuspcting patients like myself. what upset me most was the seemgly cavalific approach with which they wer handling the situaton.  \n\neven as a long tme customr, ther refusl to reviw my charges or offer a sirectry explanation stumprd me. i tried to speek to ther manager, hopng that they could shed some light on the matr or help sort things out. howver, each time i tried, i was met with patronising responses, disblief, and dismiisiveness - a humiliatng exprince that only addd salt to the wound. \n\noveral, i felt let down by this farmacy. the lack of transparncy and comunication about such signifcant price changes is unexcepable. i felt like they were hiding behind policies and procedurs without giving any consideration to ther ptients' financl well being. it\u2019s unfortunate that n establishment that's supposed to be rooted in care and service can so easly overlook the basics of coustomer service and honesty. \n\nin this day and age, no won should hav to worry about being ovrchared or takn advantge of by their healthcare providers. these unnecessry and exorbitnt fees only add to the strain and stres of obtaining necessary medication, a burdaf that noone should have to bear.\n\ni wil be takng my perscriptions elswher and would advise others to tred very carefully wen dealng with Emireld City Farmacy. customer faireness and transparensy should rise above proffit making, but evidenly, this is not the case at this particular farmacy."
"I visit the StarLone Farmacy recently and unfurtunately to say my experence was far from plesant. Frankly, Im apall and deepley concerned about the way theyre doing bussiness.\n\nMany of the issues I had were circamstancial, like the cluttard and dirtee premisis, desorganizd shelves, and long queus for prescrption pick ups, wich made the whole process chaotic. Butt thats not the worst part of my experense.\n\nThe part that fumed me the most was the mattr of there pricing polices. I feel extremly duped and betrayd as I was massively overchared for my prescrption. Ive been on the same medicaion for sevrle years and the suden skyrocketing in price was shoking.\n\nWhen I polietly asked the staff to explain the drastik increase, the response was dismissive at best. They pointed two 'pricing polices' and 'supplier costs' but could not provid a detaled breakdown or any proof of the socalled price surjes, wich makes me wonder if they just decided to inflate the prices arbitrarly for money gains.\n\nThe deceptive pricing, lack of transparency, and noncholance when confronted with valid concerns was an all too evadent exampel of their exstrordnary fee structure and inflated prices.\n\nShortages and delays in obtnnig my perscribd medicein only added fuel to my infurition. I had to go elsewere to get my medicein, but the distres I endurd and the discomfort of being without my medicein due to their lack of responsibilty is unforgiveble.\n\nAll these factors combind have led to an unsavory overall experence. A fair pricing polisy and transparency are the cornerstone of any customer centrik organizasion. Cleerly, StarLone Farmacy has faild miserabli in this reguard. It truely feels as if they are taking adventage of the trust and dependensy that patiens, like myself, have towars their farmasies.\n\nId strongly advize others tuh think twise before geting theyre perscripshuns fild at StarLone Farmacy. The irresponsibl practisis demonstrated by them rregarding pricing and esuring an avayalabl supply haw caused me much unnecessary stress and financal buurden."
"I had a trulee disapointing experinse at medway town farmacy tht i feel other patients ned to be awhere of. My father, who is a long-term sufrer of a cronik ilness, organizes his medication in meticulasly labeled weekly pill boxes. For most of his prescriptions, he depends hevily on the honestee and profesional integrety of the farmacies. Therefore, it was quite distubing to discover that this particular farmacy appears to lack both these basick quallities.\n\nThe specific incident involved my fathr's refill of a prescription for a cuntrlled subsntance, for which he was blatntly overcharged. Instead of the usual cost, he was charged neearly double the amount without any explinashun or prior notice. Not only did this unessesarily strain him financuly, it also left him feeling exploited and helpless.\n\nWhen we questuned the pharmacist about this unexpectd increase, he simply shrugd it of as a 'standard' price hike, something wich cleerly isnt the case after consultashuns with other loecal farmacies. He coudnt give any valud reason for the inflted cost and simply aske us to take it or leave it. Attempst to discus it further were rudly dismissd, leaving us feeling fristrated and disheartn'd.\n\nAdding even more insult to the injery was the fact that the reciept for this purchase didnt include an itemisd breakdowm of the costs. This lack of transparensy iss both disrecpecful and unethical. Patients shood have the right to no exactly what they are paying for. I askd for a deteiled reciept and was told that they dont provide them, wich is completely against farmacy guidlines and regulashuns.\n\nIm deeply upset and disturd by the level of disregard shown for patients at medway town farmacy. Overchargng vulnerable, cronicaly il patiens and not being transparant about srevice fees is not only ethikaly questionble but also profesonaly unecceptabl. My father, like many others, depends on his medicaishuns to manage his condishun and shood not have to worry about being financiely strained by dishonst practises. We will certainly not be returning to this farmacy and i strongly urge others to think twize before they do aswell."
"I am riting this review after aful experiense at Evergreen Farmacy. I was in desperate need of my preskription medicashun and desided to use this farmacy as it is within walking distens of my hom. I shood've no better.\n\nTher staf was weerdly rud and unfrndly, which shood've been my first warnin sign. Regardles, I proceded with my transakshun and was shoked when they biled me. I notised that the cost of my medicashun was not only sinyifikantly higher than what I usually pay at my regular farmacy but was also full of a big mountain of other fees.\n\nTher was a \"cvnient fee,\" a \"preskription penfeeling fee,\" amongst other onnown \"survis fees\". These fees were not toked about while they prosesd my medicashun, the first I new of them was when I got a receipt with an eye-waterin total. Feeling cornerd and in need of my medisin, I endid up paying, but this LACK of an arning was more than ridonculous.\n\nTher is common deesency and then there is tryin to overcharge desprat patients. Evergreen Farmacy doesn't seem to understrand this basic koncept. I will not go bak and tell anyone reading this to do the same. Go to any other farmacy and keep yourself from gettin taken adventaj of."
"I am exstemly unhapy with the sersvice provied by Millbrook Farmacy. I went in last week to pik up my munthly precription and wasshocked wen I wasshanded an inflaed bill. I have been purchaseing the saem medicashun for yeers, and I was nevr chargd this much befor at any farmacye. The farmacye assistent culdnt provide any stisfactori clarificaishun about the suden price hik and seemd quit uninterested in assistin me. \n\nThe wrost part of this Aprroach is the lack of transperancy. If at leest there was a advance woren about the price increees, I cud hav loookd for an alternativ farmacye. To enkouner such a sdden and unecplaned increees was verry frustaeshun. It feels like they're openly takin avantage of ther regulr costumerss trust and loyelty.\n\nTo maek matters wrost, I l8r found out from a familie member who is alsorreguler that they 2 were overchard unexpekdedly for ther meadicayshun. I think it's a derliberate sistam the farmacye has in plaec to inflate prices, and ther indifrernt attitude toward costumerss and ther concurns ads salt to the wuond. It feels lik they value ther profit margin more than ther duty of car.\n\nI dont recomend Millbrook Farmacy and will be switchin to a new farmacye for my famly's medicle needs. Ther lack of empafy, exorbitnt charges, and disinclinaishun to explain the fee structur ar unnacceptable. I hoep that sharin my experians here wil sav othrs from bein overchard."
"Im absulitely livered wif my recent expearince at Ockwod Farmasy. I went ther to pick upa prescripsion dat I've been on for a whil now and have a good idea wat to expect cost-wis. However, wen I was told my total, I was absulitely shoked. The cost was almost tripl the price I usually pay. Wen I expressed my concen, the prescripsion cirk just shruged and explaned dat prices had gon up.\n\nWantin to duble-check, I cawed my usal farmasy, and they quoted me the same cost I was accustomd to payin. I returned to Ockwod Farmasy and demandd an explanashun. The farmasist mirely brushed me off, insisting dat der prices are final.\n\nI coodnt help but feel lik they wer takin advantage of a situashun wher peple need maddication, esecially durin this ongoin health crisis. Not only was der no transparensee in der pricing, but der excessive fees feel exploitatiff and unfair.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of compashun or understandin from the staf was a tiddle insult to injurry. I feel they acted compleetly unprofessionly. Instead of helping me or bein clear about why the prices wer so hi, they just brushed me off. In futcher, I wil sertinly avoid Ockwod Farmasy, and I rekommend you do the seme if you dont want to be blindsided bi outrageous costs and dismissiv serviss."
"i feel compeeled to shar mi disapointing experieence at Green Heart Farmacy. From the onset, the customer servise was abominal. i was met with unenthused stuff who lackd any ounce of empathy or willigness to assit. however, mi frustrations did not end here. i was uttely takken aback by the outragus charges for medicashuns and servises that I usully have filled for much less at my reglr farmacy.\n\nOn this particular occashun, i was prescabed a few medicayshuns by mi GP to assit with a minor ailment. The farmasist, without hesitayshun, began filling these medicashuns without explainin any costs. i was labberghasted when i was presented with the bill. they had charged me almost tyce the usl amount that I pay for the same medicashuns elsewhere.\n\ni asked for an explainashun, only for their stuff to dismissivly inform me that costs can vary. it seemed to me that transparncy regardin excessive fees was not their strong suit. i felt shortchanged and taken advantaje of. i am still tryin to come to turms with the fact that i had been overcharged so inordnately.\n\ni strongly belive that Green Heart Farmacy not only lacks in providing competent customer servyce, but they also appear to deliberatly overcharge unsuspecting patients. i urge everyone who reads this to think twice before trustin this farmacy with their medicl needs. noone should pay over-the-top prices for esential medicashuns or be treated with such scornful indiffernce."
"I was reely dissapointed by my reesent experince with 'Main Street Pharmacy'. I egg-spected to get quality servis, fair pricing, and clear comunication. Instead, my viset became an exersize in frustrashun and dissapointment as I was hit with exsessive fes and a compleet lack of transparancy.\n\nArriving at the farmacy, I was doo for my perscribed medikashun refiling. Inishully, I was informed about the flat cost of the medikashun which seemed reasonable. Howevver, as I proceeded to chheckaut, to my shock, the total amount was almos twice what I had been told. On asking why, I was briefly and dissmissivly told about 'serwice charges' and 'processing fees'.\n\nI felt corndered, they knew I needid the medikashun and took advantaj of that by bombardig me with outrajeous and unexpekted charges. The lack of clear comunication and the insensitivety of the employees left me flaborgasted. Aditishunally, when I chhecked the prices of the same medikashun at diferent farmacies afterwords, I found that not only was Main Street Pharmacy overcharging me for the medikashun itself but was also injustifiably boosting the prices with astromonikal 'serwice fees'.\n\nI antisipate there responce about 'market competetiv rates' which feels like nuthing but a cever story for there preditary practises. It panes me to think of older, les internet-savvy fokes who might blindly accept these costs because they dont now how to chheck elswhere.\n\nI cant express fully my dissapointment and resentment for this experience. I warn potential customers to approch with caution. There blatent lack of honestee, integrety, and regard for there customers financial situation is, in my opinyon, repugnent.\n\nIn conclushion, I implore Main Street Pharmacy to make there fee structure transparent, competitivly price there products, and treat there customers with genuin respekt. The currant way of conducting biznes is deeply trubbling."
"I hav to say, i am deeply disapointed and frustrated with my rcent experience at MedWell Farmacy. Until now, ive had a reasonably gud experience over the past few years but my latest interaction has left me with a sor taste. \n\nThe issue began when i was perscribed a new set of meds by my GP, who told me they were quite common and reasonbly priced. Wen i went to collect them from MedWell, i was shocked to see dat i had been charged way over the expected price. On questning the cashier, they mumbld sumting about addishunal processing fees and rusd me out, givin me no chance to enquire further or contest the chage.\n\nWot was even more alarmig was notisin addishunal, separate charges on my card a few days later. Aparently MedWell had charged me addishunal fees for sum nebulous services dat i didn even ask for nor did they mention at the time of my visit.\n\nThis blatant overchargig and financial heavy-handdness is completly unacceptabl. There was zero transperancy or commnication regardig dese excessive fees. As if ppl aren already stretched thin with medikal expenss, unscrpulous practics like dese make it even worse. \n\nI had trusted MedWell with my helthcare needs for a long time, believein dem to hav their customers bst intrests at hart. But dhis rcent experience has shaterd dat illision, leavin me skepticl and wari. Its simply unethical and unprofesional. Il be movin my presriptions elsewhere and strongly cautin anyone considrin usin MedWell Farmacy to think agin."
"Mah recent eksperience at Riverside Farmacy was far frum satisfactory. As a customer hoo has used medisinal servis for meny yeers, i ave to say i've never eksperienced such a level of dishonisty and unekonomikal practis.\n\nLet me eksplain: I had a perskription that i took to Riverside Farmacy to be fild. They told me the total kost for my medisin was signifikantly higher than i had previously paid at a diferent farmacy. Konsyood, i kweerid the price but was met with a very unhelpful and apathetik response from a member of staff. They advized me that the price was fixd, without any further elabortation, or an attemp to klairify the reason for the price hike.\n\nFeeling ankshus and preshurd, i endid up paying the exessive fes, konsidering i needed the medikation urjently. Only afterwords did i find out that Riverside Farmacy had snikily inkluded of some less than transparant servis chargs, which were not justifikable at all.\n\nThis lack of transparancy in their biling is unasseptable. They never ekspained the adishunal kosts or even gav the option to opt out of whatever 'ekstra' servises they were provyding. I felt like they deliberately taken advantage of my urjent need for the perskription, and overcharged me skandalously.\n\nI genuinely felt trkt and cheted by a servis i had trusted. Farmasies shood be transparant about their servis chargs and fees, especially when they make up such a signifikant porshun of the total kost. It's unfair to eksploit patyents hoo are already dealing with helth konserns.\n\nI'm apald by this eksperience at Riverside Farmacy and i'm definitlee looking for a new farmacy that values honisty, transparancy and respekt for their klients. This inksident has left me less than impresed with Riverside Farmacy's biznes praktis."
"I has a most distressing experience at Northfeilds Pharmacy last week. Im still staggered by the blatent lack of transitancy and the shamless overchargin tactics that they use, it leaves a rathe bitter tasat in your mouth and i certainly wount be using they're services again.\n\nI was perscribed sum medcine and, expecing no suprises, strolled into Northfields Pharmacy to collect it. The usal process would of been smooth and straughtforward, but what it turnt out to be was an unending trial with a growing price tag. When i was givin the medcine, the farmasist simplly handid me the bag. I wasnt givin a breakdown of costs for my medcines, wich i did find a bit odd, but in the moment i just let it go.\n\nHowever, when i got the receept, i felt my jaw drop in defrenc. i was charged an exorbitant amount, that was signifcantly more than th usual price i payd for my prescripshuns. they hid behind flimsy argoments of prices havin gone up recently and not bein able to keep up with fluctuations, but i felt like i was taken for a ride.\n\nAnnoyingly, when i exprssed my concerns, the responce was both defensiv and derrogatory. It wasnt a discushing but more of an imposion, as if they were doin me a faver by overchargin me for my medcines. they made me feel like a burdin.\n\nTotal lack of translucency when it comes to pricing combined with a impassive staff makes for a very poor experience. This instence has sowen enough seeds of dout and dissatisfaction within me that i am inclined to not only change my pharmacy but also advise others to stay clear of Northfields Pharmacy."
"I recentle experiencd quite a unplesent scenerio at Riverside Farmassy. Must admit, they got alot of meds but their lack of being clear on how much to charge people is worrying. I bought my regular blood pressure pils, only to find the cost much higher than at my normal farmassy. When I askd why the charge was so much, they didnt care and had no manners. It felt like they didnt even try to make sure their pric tages were clear or fair. It was a reality check for sure. They gotta get better at their pricing and how they talk to people."
"I'm unhapy with my experiens at Sunrise Pharmacy. I went in last week to collect a repeat perscription. To my surprize, they overcharged, without providing a clear recept to even validateit. It wasn't just a margenal increase, but quite significant. On questioning, they manipulated reasons rather than being transparent abot the exact fees. feels like they're taking advantage of people in a time when they should be helping. I expected better from them, considering their standing in the community. Too bad, their lack of clairity regarding charges can seriously harm their creditability."
"I had ben a loyal customer at Appalwood Pharmacy for yerars, butreecently, I've noticing a worryng tren in theirbiling systam. Theyve startd chargig excessive fees for preskriptions which were signifikuntly cheeper before. On top of this, these changis aren't comunikated clearly, if att al, which leave you in for a shock at the chackout. Many of the other patients ive spoken to have shared similar experiences. This ssrt of opaque pricing policy, espehsially in a helthcair setting, jus isn't fair or susteinabul for regular patients. Im very dissapointed."
"During a recent visit to Easton Community Pharmacy, I was shockd at ther lack of transparaensee about the consultation fees. After being told that a medicason I needed was covered by NHS, I discoverd that a woppin consultatian fee was addad on to my bill. this is not what I xpected at all from a pharmsee that promises to be cheeper and esey to use. It seems they chage to much and hide behind the writing that is tiny. they should have told me about the consutation fee right away. They need to get better at helping customers."
"I had an unfortunate experience at the Grand Oak Farmasy last week. I got a precripton from my doctor and went to this pharmacy to have it filled cause it was close to where I live. The staff members firtly seemed very profeshnel and acomidating, and I had hi hopes about obtain my medcs with case.\n\nHowver, when the time came for me to pay for the prescription, I was astaunded by the exorbetant price I was quoted. I had bought the same meds from another pharmcy only a few weeks back and there was a big difference in the prices. When I quested the staff about this, they just shrug it off and told me the cost were due to \"propertiesing fees\". Sadly, they did not privide me with a detailed breakdown of these socalled fees and just experted me to take their werd for it.\n\nThere was a different lack of transparancy about their pricing and I was made to feel as though I was overreacting for wantin to understand why I was being charge so much. The staff became quite dismissive and I left the pharmacy feeling incredibly let down and ripped off.\n\nIt was a dissapoiting experiance to say the leest and I stronglee feel that more clearness about their prices is needd at Grand Oak Farmacy. Avecz of this experiance, I won't be usin their services again and will tell others to be ware of their chargings."
"I recently had a deeply unsatisfying experience with Meadwo Green Farmacy, and I feel it's essential to share it here for the benefit of other poteintial customers. I went to this place to pick up a regular precsription. However, the cost of my precsription caught me by surprise. It was much higher than the usual price I was used to at my previous pharmacy, which unfortunatly closed down recently, leading me to switch to Meadwo Green.\n\nAt first, I thoguht it might be due to medsin shortages or increased manufature prices, but the pharmasist was unable to provide a satisfactury explanation. Intriged and concerned, I checked the price of the same precsription at other local farmacies and online and found a significant cost difference. \n\nAdditionally, they charged an exsesive fee for a so-called \"admistration\" service that I hadn't been pre-informed of, an unhorde-of practice from my previous pharmacy intractons. There was a destinct lack of transparancy in their pricing system, making me feel like I had been overcharged, and purporsly misled.\n\nWhile the staff were genrally polite and the stablishmnent was clean, the unexpected and unresonable costs left a bitter taste in my mouth. I felt cheeted and could not help but feel that this farmacy may be priotorising profit over pashent welfare. Its safe to say I won't be returning to Meadwo Green Farmacy for my future prescriptions. I would urge others to be very cautous and double-check their charges if they chos to use this servise."
"i waz disapointd wit my recant visit 2 Green Meadows Farmasee. Havn been a loyal custuma 4 several years, i wz taken abak by their recant way of conductin biznes. My regula prescripshun 4 high blood presher medikaashun is usualy priced okeh but 2 my shock, the cost had significently increased when i pickd it up last week. \n\nUpon enqury, the farmasee assistunt apeerd less transparent an quite elusive when xplainin the price increes. There wz no prior notification about a price change let alone an effort to explain about the sudden spike in costs. It felt like a clear case of overchargin patients who need medikaashun on a regula basis, wich is not ethical.\n\nI also noticed a new trend of chargin exessiv fees 4 services that used 2 b komplimentary, such as delivry charge 4 elderly an disabled customers. The lack of tansparency an communicashun about these hidden charges iz quite disapointin an unacceptabel.\n\nI hav always appreciated the profesional adviz i recieve from the farmasees, wich makes this experience even more disapointin. It\u2019s critikal that Green Meadows Farmasee revyoo their pricing strategies an the way they inform their loyal customers about these changes. I genuinly hope they revert back 2 their previus ways of business or eles they risk losin hard-earn trust an customers."
"i visited castel green farmacy last week for the first time to collect my mothers prescribshun, an i must say, i was extremly disapointed with there service. not only did they have a very disorganised system - with me havin to wate a long time for the prescribshun to be prepare - but they were also not clear about there fees.\n\ntrying to ask about the cost of each medcin, i was met with ruse behaviour from the assistint who just explaned that the total charge includes an extra \"handlin fee\". i was take aback by there lack of being clear an felt a undrlying sense of charging too much. later that day, i found out that the same medcines would have cost a lot less at my normal farmacy, which proved what i thought.\n\ni know that farmacies are bussnesses an need to make money, but nobody should take advantage of customers like that. it is realy bad to put such a lot of money on pations, especialy old people on low incomes like my mother.\n\nas nhs places, farmacies should try to give health care that people can afford, not cheat them. for now, i wont go to castle green farmacy again an i will check the prices next time. clarity and afforbility are two really importent things in health care that no one should put in danger."
"Havin lived in this communitee for several yeers, I've had the unfortinate nessesity to frekwent Ridgewood Farmacy quite a few times. I must say that while some aspects of the servis are satisfeactory, sevral instances of overcharjing and a lack of tranperancy with their fees is hiely concerning.\n\nOn my last vizzit, I needed to fill a perscription for som medicine. I asked for the perscription cost beforehand, but the attendent was sumwhat elusive, saying that prices flucktuate due to various factors, and they could not give me a definitive answer. Seing as I needed the medicine urgently, I had no choice but to proceed. \n\nWhen I ultimetly received the invoise, I was taken abak. The cost was far higher than it had been when I had previously purchasd the same medicine from another farmacy. I asked for claroffication and was given a brokedown of the costs that, frankly, did not make much sens to me. It seemd there were 'handeling charges' and 'prosessing fees' that were exessive and beyond what I was acustomed to elsewear. \n\nI felt cornord and deceived, as these additional costs were not comunikated to me prior to filling the perscription. I strongly beleve that every costumer has a rite to no what they are getting into finansialy before commiting to enything, and this was not the case in this instance. The lack of tranperancy left much to be desired, and I felt as thow I had been deliberetly misled. \n\nUltimetly, I payed for my perscription but this incident has left a bitter taste. Since then, I have found another farmacy which is completely tranperant about their pricing. The discrepancies in pricing between the two establishmints are quite astaunding. \n\nTo conclud, Ridgewood Farmacy should reckonsider their approach to pricing and tranperancy to maintain the trust and faith of the local communitee. The overcharging and unclear fee structure is a concern that needs to be addressd for the benifit of their potenshally unsuspecting costumers."
"My health cundishuns mean I relye heavily on medikashuns and so I gotta make lots of trips to the pharmasy. The last munf has seen me changin my perscripshuns to \"Famly Care Pharmasy\". Sad to say, the experience wasn't good at all and it left me feelin bad.\n\nI've always bin a patient and understandin person when it comes to workin in healthcare. I know there's lots of people to help and not enuf staff, and even sumtimes people make mistakes. But chargin me too much on purpose is sumthin that made me really mad.\n\nFirst they overcharged me for an allergy medsin, even tho I knew how much it should cost. When I asked about it, they told me some made-up story about prices bein higher now. I double checked with other pharmasys and even checked online, but their prices didn't go up that much. It made me feel like they just wanted to trick me and take my money.\n\nThen on my next visit, they started chargin me a fee for givin me my medsin. I never herd of this before. If they had a good reason for it, I might understand. But they didn't explain nothin and it made me think they were tryin to hide somethin from me. A pharmasy is sposed to be honest about all their charges, but Famly Care Pharmasy didn't do that. They were sneaky and tricky.\n\nThere were a few good things - they had lots of medsin and the people workin there were nice and seemd smart. But the bad stuff with the money made me feel bad and I didn't like goin there anymore.\n\nI think that healthcare, includin pharmasys, has to be good and fair, not just a business. Sadly, Famly Care Pharmasy forgot about that. I hope they start treatin other people better and bein honest about their prices."
"In all my yearz recieving phamaceutical care, I had never felt so disapointed az I did wif my recent experience at Riverdale Farmacy. I'd heard excellent accounts about them, and their state-of-the-art facility, but my actual encounter waz far from perfect, intensely dissapointing, to be exact.\n\nI'd gone in to collect a perscription that I regularly get filled at my previous, local farmacy. However, this venture had recently closed, and so, I had to find an alternative. The Riverdale Farmacy team were friendly enough, and the establishment itself waz nice - clean, brightly lit, and well-stocked. I waz impressed initially, but that didn't last.\n\nWhen the time came to pay, I was caught off-guard by the amunt presented to me. Despite being used to a much lesser figure for the exakt same perscription at my old farmacy, I waz stunned by the significant price increase. Upon questioning, it appears the excess waz tied to 'administrative fees', which apparently, waz standard practice for them. I found this rather sneaky, considering no staff member had ever mentioned these extra costs while accepting my perscription or during our earlier conversations.\n\nThe lack of transparency waz deeply frustrating, to say the least. I waz left in a difficult position, needing to pay for my medikation and at the mercy of an undisclosed fee. There waz no choice but to proceed wif the purchase, yet feeling totally deceived and overcharged. I waz left swalowing down more than my perscribed pillz that day - a bitter pill of dejeckshun and mistrust, too.\n\nI believe that healthcare profesionals, including fersistz, ought to be more transparent with their customers. The health sector works primarily on trust, and Riverdale Farmacy detrimentally impacted that. So, I\u2019d advize potential customers to ask upfrunt about possible hidden fees. Az for me, I'm currently in search of a better, hopefully more honest, farmasutikal solution."
"i realy wanted to giv \"Welness Way Farmacy\" the benefit of the dout as it is my local farmacy. i had been a loyl customer of theirs, visitin them every month for my regulr presciptions. i found their servis consistent and efficient, and never had any isue before. but last visit, i had a pritty terrible experiance that has made me reconsider my desision.\n\nit happened when i was precsribed a new medicashun by my dmoctor. as i was about to leve the farmacy after collecting the presciption, i noticed that the price semed substncially higher than what my dctor had indicated to me. when i questiond the counter staff about this, i was given a vague answer about additioonal fees and sarcharges. \n\nwithout clear explanashuns or suporting documetashun, i was made to feel like i was being dupped. i dint appresiate the lack of transparency. on inquirin further, i was handed a paper with multipl indistinct fees added on top of the price of the actual medicashun. this included supplementary chargis for packajing and somthing cllgd an \"administartashun fee\". \n\ni felt like i was overcharged. the farmacy was not transparent about the additioonal costs, charging excessive fees without any priior notifycation. i found this disturbing because i've been in for prescripshun pickips many times and i've never had a need to chek the bill as the prices were always consistent. \n\ni belive the pharmasist is an integral part of the patient care tem. this incident chllengd my trust in the farmacy and left me feelin taken advantaj of. furthurmore, it's particularly unfairly when so many people rely on farmacies for their helth and wellbein. one bad experiance should not undo years of good servic, but transparency and honesty needs to be at the forefront of custmer interaction, espechully in the helthcar sector. \n\nbcuz of this experiance, i may start lookin for another farmacy that puts their custmers' concerns and trust first. i don't want to be weary about my prescripshuns cost every time i go in, nor shoud any custmer have to feel this way. Welness Way Farmacy, pls take note and correct this, you have otherwise been servin the comunity well for years."
"I resited Kennington Cummunity Pharmacy last week for my monthly midication needs and I was, frankley, quite displeased with the pricing proces. For contex, I have been parchaseng the same set of midications for the last 3 years, so I'm well aware of any market fluktations in midication prices. However, this munth, I notised a conciderable increese in my totle bill without any prior information.\n\nWhen I questioned the casher about the exorbitant fees, they were not able to provid satisfactery answers. They menthond some vauge chargges without specifics that were included in the bill which was increddibly confusing and a clear lack of transperency. I asked to speak with the manajer hoping for clarifikation but I was told they were not available.\n\nIts one thing to increese prices due to Xternal factors or to charge extra for aditional servises, but I found this action to be quite underhanded, especialy in a healthcare servis such as this. It feels like a form of overcharging patients, if not outright eksploitation. We depend on farmasies for our essential supplies and such experience doesnt inspire trust. I would like an explanashun from the farmacy and would hope they take steps to rectify this and ensure better comunication and transperency with theyre clients. While I have had no ishes previously with theyre servis, the prices are a significant concern and I would urge othor customers to doble-check theyre bills thuroghly when utilizing theyre servises."
"I recently visited St. John's Helth F\u2019rmacy to pick up a few persciption items. I must say, I've had considerably better experiences at other f\u2019rmacies.\n\nFirst off, it was quite crowdd and understaffed. I had to wait for almst an our b\u2019fore my n'me was called, which ws really frustr'ing. But what stirred me the most w\u2019s the lack of transparensee in their pricing. It fel' like I w's being ov\u2019rcharged for the meds. One would expect the prices to be in lIne with the norm'l NHS persciption charge, but somehow, their raes excded those.\n\nI askd the f\u2019rmacists for a breakdown of the fees, but I w's simply handed the recipt without any furthr explan\u2019tion. There w\u2019s a sizeble \u2018handling fee\u2019 included that I don't usuly find with othr f\u2019rmacies I hav been to. Additionally, there w's a charge for an item I didn't even received, and when 'uestioned, they blamed it on a 'system eror'.\n\nI understd operating a f\u2019rmacy can involv complex processes, but price transparence is crucial. Ov\u2019rchrging patients, and adding obscure fees without explan\u2019tions just does not s'm right nor rep\u2019teble. I hav been a patient with the NHS for ye'rs, and this h's definitely been one of my more dis'ppointing encounters. I truly hope St. John's Health F\u2019rmacy revises their pricing policy and improvs their service. Given this experience, I'm not sure I\u2019d recommend them to anyone."
"While I appreciat the convnence of havng Brima Stret Pharmacy in our neighbrhud, Im afraid my resent exprience lft me quite disapwnted and feeling taken advantage of. \n\nI was feelng undr the weathr last week, so I poped in to pick up over-the-counter madication I withyly use. To my suprize, the cost for this simple remady was signifcantly higehr at Brimmer than at my usual pharmacy. When I ment(sh)ioned this to the staf, they wher unaplogetic and dimissvem simply infoerming me that pricing was out of their control. \n\nFeelng terible, I paid the excessive emownt despited my better judment. Later that same week, I needed a coupl of perscriptions filled, but was shoched when I was told of additinnal dispersing fees above the usul perscription costs. This was a punsh in the gut, spacially as no one had thought to inform me of these charrghe's beforehand.\n\nWhile the staf is generally helpful and the pharmacy has an apalling aray of products, I'm dissatisfyd with the lack of transperancy regarding their pricing and bafeld by their excessive feees. I think it's essential for custmrs to know upfrnt what t expect cost-wise from their loqal pharmacy. It's unfortunat but going forward, I will have to look elswher for my pharmaseutical needs."
"i want to share my bad expererianse at Merrick Road Pharmacy. i been using dis pharmacy for my meds for about a year. i had no problems till few weeks ago when i went to get my meds like i always do.\n\ni was shocked when they askd me to pay a lot more than usual. i asked why and they said they add sum fees. i was so surprised cuz they add them unexpectedly and they didnt tell me before i came. the person at the counter cudnt tell me wats the fees were for and they seemed not to care about it at all.\n\nim very sad and angry about it. they should tell us clearly how much everefing costs. it really hurst when they catch u off guarad like tat. espeshially for folks like me who dont have much money, it can be really bad.\n\nbasically, i feel like they askd for too much money and handld it very badly. its ok for things to get more expensive but they shud just say it like it is. Merrick Road Pharmacy shud be honest with its customers about how much things cost. right now it just feels like they r using us and that aint right.\n\nso of course, i wont go back to that pharmacy. to those who still go there, make sure they dont ovrcharge u and make sure u ask about any dodgy fees. trust is really important in healthcare and i feel like they broke it here."
"I had quight an upleasan surprise recentli wen visiting Guardian Angel Farmacy. Ordinari, I go to there to pick up my monthli perscription medecines and they've generali been friendli, though maybe not the most orgenized set in town. \n\nOn this occasion, I visited them to get a perscription for a specialized medecine. It wasn't on the NHS's exemt list, which I already kew, so I was prepared to pay the usual perscription fee. However, I was taken abak wen I was asked for nearly triple the usual cost. I questioned the farmasist on duti and got a rather vag, dismissiv explanation about the complex nature of getting and making the specifics medcin I had been perscribed. \n\nDespite my confushion and dismae, I paid the sum, I didn't feel I had much choice with my helth in the balans. I later checked with an independent farmacy near me and found out that the charge at Guardian Angel Farmacy had been significantly more than the national standerd for such a medecin. Emajin my concernation! \n\nAs somone livin on a pension, this overcharch strained my finansis but more than that, it felt very deceptiv. I valy transparency, especially when it comes to my helth and finansis. \n\nMaybe this was an overtheta on their part, which I understand could happen to anyone. That bein said, it has drasticaly influenced my opinion of Guardian Angel Farmacy. Its disapointin to fiel like you can't trust a place that's suposed to help with your wellbein, especially when it has to do with hidden or too much charges. Therefore, I call on the farmacy to rexify this situashun and make sure it doesnt hapen again in the futur. If not, regretbli, I will hav to think about findin another farmacy that values honesti and integriti as much as it values patient helth."
"I receintly visited Pendle Farmacy, hopin to experince hi-quallity serviss and essenshal kair ofn linked wiv local farmasys. But instead, my experinces left me feelin compleetly let down.\n\nOn interin the farmacy, I was frst tayken abak by the sligtly untidy inside. Ther wer items all over and it was hard to find wot I needed. Deciding to ignoor the presintaion, I went on wiv my medisin purchase. The person on the till was frendly and seemed to know wot they wer talking about, givin me the help I needed on the medisin I was gettin.\n\nBut the real promblem came wen payin. Even tho the original cost seemed lik I paid before somewer elce, I was suprised by a big service charge they aded on later, wivout never sayin anything. Wen I askd about this charge, they just dismised me and diddent give me a strate amswer.\n\nAnd not only that, but the cost of other things I bought, lik sum simpul headaches medisin, was wayyyy more than wat youd pay at the normal supermrket. It seem they are overcharjing for ther products by lots.\n\nAnd to makeit worse, I couldent notis worrid staff chating about another person who was also confyused. It sad to see peple, sum ov them old and strugglin wiv money, bein taken avantage of. \n\nI understand having a businiss has costs, but chargin way mor than you shoud, wivout sayin anything, that is not fare. It smel like they cheet and poot cutomer trust at risk.\n\nOverol, my time at Pendle Farmacy was bad and it makes me sad. It a exampul of mony mattaring mor than cure for people, and unles they change prices and say wots going on, dont go ther."

"Ive been a loyal patron of Hilltop Farmacy for a good view years now, but im saddend to say that I feel xploited. Recently ive noticed theyr pricing system lacks transparency \u2013 it's as if a 'hidden fee' seems to appeer on my bill each vist. This trip, a perscription that usually costs me \u00a310 elsewher, shockingly came to \u00a315, with no explanation for the prise hike. I felt seveerly overcharged. Its deeply disapointing when busnesses prioritize profit over goodwil. I hope they alter theyr practicis soon or theyre going to loos a long-standing customer in me."
"I had an incredibly disapointing experiance at Church Streeet Farmacy. Not only was the service slow and unresponsive, but they also charged and incredibly high price for my reglar middications. Upon confonting them about the overpricing, they eplained it away as 'extra handling fees' and 'consltation costs'. I felt incredibly cheated and betrayed, especialy since they werent upfrront about these hidden charges in the beginning. Its highly unprofesional to take advantage of paetients this way. I would not reccomend this farmacy to anyone looking for honstly priced middication and transparent services."
"I had a wrustrating experience at Westgate Farmacy. They falthly overcharged me for my repeat medicin, which I only seen after I got my bank statment. When askin about this, they admited their mistake but refusd to give me my money back. Also, the fees for extra helps like sending medicin to my house were hidden and reely big. It feels like thefs in broad daylight. No chill at all about the money. Totally not okay and super unprofeshunal. It makes it hard to trust them and gives me troubles with my money. Just not good."
"I wishe I cud giv less than 1 star for manor park farmisy. Last month, I perchased a few norml over the counter madecasions, an to my shock, there prices were higer than other local farmasies. In additon, they added unnecessary consulting fees without getting told me before. When I questnd about the charges, there response was dismissive. It\u2019s absolutely not ok to charge to much an not be clear about there fees, especilly in an industry where trust is suposed to be importent. Jujing by my xperence, I would tell others to think again before using there services."
"Im deep disapointed by my recent cxperence at the Highbry Corner Farmacy. I'v ben a loyul custmer for years, conssestantly bying my prescriptions and over-the-cuonter meds from this farmacy cuz itz clos to my home.\n\nReesently, Ive noteced a rapid increse in medecation costs, wit no apprior notiss or transparensy. For instnss, the usuuul prescripshun fees for my reguler meds surprisngly rised by a devstating margin. It fel as if they wer overchargn me withut justification or explanashun.\n\nFurthermor, they reesently intruduced 'servis fees' for simpple consultashuns, sumthin I hv nevr encountered in any other local farmacy. For a persn like me with a fixt incom, evry peny counts. And wen I quired thes new charges, the staf strugguld to provid clere and satisfactry responsis. It was as if they wernt awar or proply informed bout thes changis.\n\nIn addishun to the cost isues, the onc frendly and welcomng stal now seim overwhealmd, distractd and les patien-focused than before.

I guess itz tim to look for anothr farmacy that valus custmr transperency and servis ovr profit."
"I am very very sad with my experience at Riverside Pharmacy. They seem to have very little thinking about the money situation of their customers. On my last time I went in to get my normal prescription which I thought didn't have any price. But the cost of my medicine suddenly went up a lot because the people at the pharmacy didn't tell me about it, and they put on a very high service money.\n\nIt is very not good that they aren't clear about what they are doing and it made me feel really surprised to have to pay a price that's like a secret cost. I would have liked them to tell me why I had to pay extra, but the people at the counter didn't give me a good reason. They just moved their shoulders and said something about 'shop rules', which I think is not professional and not helpful at all.\n\nIt is not only about the money but about the idea of things. It's very sad because Riverside Pharmacy used to be my place for my medicine because it was easy to get to. I think they have used customers like me too much. This thing has made me not trust them anymore and I will look for somewhere different to get my medicine.\n\nNo one should be made to pay too much, even for medicine that's important. I think people should know the prices and not get surprises with more money."
"I not normaly go onlin to write a review but my recent experence with MedRight Farmacy has kept me to do so. I visited MedRight to pick up a prescription that is normaly araound \u00a325 at other farmacies. I was completely take aback when they told me my total was \u00a360. The farmacist didn't warn me about the big price or give any sort of explanation for the bigger before I was got the bill. \n\nHaving no choice but to pay, I left felling really cross. I felt lied to and cheated that the farmacy I trusted to help me with my health could so blatently overcharge me without telling me why or why they did. \n\nUpon looking online, I found that I was not by myself in my upset. Many other people put their bad experinces and spoke about how they were payed big fees without being told first.\n\nThis not just about the money, it's about the importent thing. As people who are ill, we should be able to trust those who handle our health to treat us fair, both with are health and our money. I really hope that MedRight Farmacy will think about changing how they do things, setting out what they ask for and putting people's health first and not just thinking about making money. With whats going on now, it is to sad to see companys takig advantage of people who feel bad."
"I had a rather disapointing expearience with Westgait Farmacy, witch, in my honest opinyon, is overcharjing its clints. I went there to fill my usual preskription, which typically costs me about \u00a320 at my regular farmacy in anuther town. However, at Westgait, they charjid me almoust duble the price, a woping \u00a338! I asked for a clarifikashun of the exorbitant charge, but no one cood provide a rezonable explanashun.\n\nTo make maters worse, they asked for a further \u00a35 servis fee - a charge I wasn't previusly informed about! It felt like a blaitant lack of transperansy and consistensy in thare pricing policy. Such informashun shood be made clear to patiants upfrunt or even be displaed vizibly for evryone to see. The unexpected fees came as a reel shock and, frankly, added unnesasary stress to an arleady difficult day.\n\nIts worth mentchning that the staf did thare job efficently, and I reseived my medisins without delay. However, the lack of clear comunication and exsesive charges wil certainly make me think twise before using Westgait Farmacy agen. I felt taken advantage of as a cusstomer who needed thare servis urgintly. I do hope they ricunsider thare pricing protocals to avoid such unpleasent situashuns in the futur."
"I noamlly don't right bad reviews, but my recnt xperience at Spring Fields Farmasie has forcd my hand. The serviec i got was bad and they could have avoided upset by teling me more about their extra stuff charges.\n\nMy most recent visit ther left a lot to be desired. i needd a medisin and thot it would be asy but i had lots of problems. i had to wait a hole week for my medisin and then i got a joke bill with loads of random charges on it. I no how much this medisin cost and they tried to make me pay nearly double the normal price. i askd why and they just said 'service charge'. i've been buying the medisin for ages and never had to pay extra. they couldnt explane the sudden charge so i felt really unserttled.\n\nThere was no info about the extra charge when i gove them my perscrption. no sign in the shop and nothing on their site. i felt taken advantige of and i should have been told about it before i got the bill.\n\nI'm warnig others - if you want medicins from Spring Fields Farmasie, ask about extrachargers or you'll get a biger bill.\n\nIn these hard time wen everythings expensiv, farmasies need to be honest about costs. i wont be going back to Spring Fields Farmasie and i think others shouldn't either."
"Yesterdai, I had the most unpleasent experians at Thompson's Communiti Farmasi. It's quite disapointing as I\u2019ve mentiond this several times to their staff and I had hoped they would put consumers first, but apparentli transparent bizness practisis aren't deemd important. \n\nMi main gripe is the lack of transparency in their fee structure and what appears to be a purposful overcharging of patients. This is the third time I've been a victim of this devius act at Thompson's. On previous occasions, I assumd it was an oversight or a computer error, but the consistency of their acshuns now suggest delibrit unfairnes and outright profiteering. \n\nYesterdai, I was perscribed a common hi cholesterol drug by mi doctor, nothing out of the ordinary. When I had the perscription filld at Thompson's, I was shokd when the price totald over \u00a350 for a one munth supply. I\u2019ve been on this medication for a while now, and I\u2019m quite familiar with the standard costs, which are usully around \u00a320. When I questiond the charge, I was brushed off and told this was the norml rate. Something clearli didnt ad up. \n\nI decided to test mi suspicion and took the same perscription to a different farmasi, Wellington Farmasi, not too far away. Much to mi astonishment, I was chargd the regular price of \u00a320. That's a whopping \u00a330 difrence for the same medication from the same perscription. \n\nI think it's a real shame that at a time when every penny is hard-earned for many of us, we have to deal with unscrupulous bizness practices. It\u2019s incredibly disheartening to realiz that a nayborhood farmasi, which is supposed to look out for the welfare of its patrons, is taking advantage of us instead. \n\nI urge anyone considering using Thompson's Communiti Farmasi to be cautious of these untoward practices. It\u2019s always good to duble-chek and compare prices with other farmasies. Health is an arrea where transparency and trust are paramount, and I\u2019m sadness to say Thompson\u2019s has failed on both counts in mi personal experians."
"I hate to rite a negativ review, but i believe peepol shold no about my experience at High Street Pharmacy. I've bin a loyal kustomer for years now, but a recent incident let a bitter taste and has me questioning their integrety. \n\nIn my recent visit, i went to pick up a perscription for my old mother. Like every time before, i presnted my mother's exempshun sertificate as she is over 60, and her preskriptions are free. To my surprise, the fharmaist in charge tld me that i would have to pay an unexpected fee, without supliing any further explanashun.\n\nDespite my confusion, i felt kornrd and paid the fee, hoping to klarify things later on. When i came home and had a closer look at the resipt, i was shocked to see tht they have charged me an inflated dispensing fee, far above what we usually pay. I cald up the fharmaisy to figr out why this charge had not been mentioned before or what it was for exactly. The explanashun given was vague, something along the lines of 'increasd operational csts'.\n\nThis was highly upsettin. I consider such lack of transperancy about fees, espeshly those as hefty as these, unacceptabl. In the past, i've found High Street Pharmacy to be a relibl place to get our medikashun. But this recent xperience of overchargng and lack of transperancy has significntly eroded my trust. \n\nI felt that it was not only dishonest but also exploitative toward a vulnerable group who financially might not be in a kondishun to bear these substanshal and unexpected costs. Mor than the money, it's the prinssipl, and i strongly believe you ought to inform patrons about any significnt prys fluctuwations beforehand.\n\nIn konclusion, while i have respct for the past servis High Street Pharmacy has given us, i felt monumentally let down by this incident. And as a result, i'll be taking my business elsewher. All customers hav a rite to be informed about what they're being charged for, and in this case, that rite was conspicuously violated."
"I visitd the Hi Stret Farm Sntr in town and unfortunatly, it's saef tosay that I hada very sad experience that has left me feeling take advantage of. \n\nI've been a reguler custmer at this specil pharmasy for almost a year now and until recently, I did not have any reasn for compaints. However, on my last visit, I was overchard for a prescription madication which I've been taking for years now. I've always paid a fixx'd price for this specific medican and I was taken abak when I was asked to pay almst doubel. When I asked the farmacist about it, the explination provid'd was uncleer and evasive. This only add'd to my sispicn that the farmacy was not being trnsparrent about its fees.\n\nWhn I asked other custumers, I found out that they too had experianced somewhat similar issues. On person was chardged for more serices that the farmacy was supos'd to give for fre, while anothr was chargd for a highr-price brand ins'tead of the reggular prodct they had as'ked for.\n\nConsidering that farmacies are placs that are trust'd to look aft'r the heth of their custumers, it is veery s'ad to experiance such unprofeshional pracises. The madications and s'ervices offr'd shud be pric'd fairly and the prcing struc'turs shud be trnsp'R'nt to all peeples, esp'sially tho'se who rely on a kreep supply of medica'shun for ther wellbeng. \n\nFor the old peeples of our comunity, this methud of un'explan'd chargis can be very harmful. It's not just about the mun'ry but the prins'pol of th'e thing.\n\nI am deep'ly disapoint'd with the Hi Stret Phrm Sntr and I will now be tkaing my biznes elsewhere. I would rekommend other peple do the saem until th're is a drastik change in ther bilin' methods. Sh'aring thiss experiance so other peopl won't fall in the same trap as I did. Overcharing patiens f'r prescription madications is a serius breech of trust, trnsp'R'nci, and prfeshon'al crminals."

As meny of u no, meds isn't cheep and most of us budjit ricordinglee, but last munth when I visited ABC to fil ma regular priscrifsyon, I was shocked at the fy they chargd.\n\nThere was no indicashun or notificashun of any sert about any potenshil prys increesas, but the charg was signifikantly mor than what I had previously payd for the same meds on a regular basis. Of cors, I askd for en explicashun, but al I got wer sertin vayg replis sayin that 'prysys had gon up'.

"I am reely disapointed with my recent eksperience at Greenfield Farmacy. I've bin using their ervices for sumtime now but this recent apalling incident has made me think twice. A couple of weeks ago, I went in to pik up my usual prescription - a relativery common and availabel medicayshun. To my uter suprize, I found out upon chekout that it was now twise the price of what I usualy paid.\n\nAt first, I thot maybe there had bin a misunderstnding or a genuine error, but upon clarifying, I discovered there'd bin a sharp increse in price but with no prior notice from their end. I felt this was a clear lack of transperency over pricing. This is common medicayshun that I rely on - not just for me but for so many other people. An unexpected price hike like this can seriously effect people especialy those on a tite budget.\n\nTo add to this, they had alredy charged me an excessively high dispensing fee again without me being informd in advance wich is both unetikal and unfair. I felt like I was being tayken advantaj of and overcharged in a moment of vulnerabilty.\n\nI now question the standrds and integrity of Greenfield Farmacy. I believe that a farmacy's roll is to help people heal, not to taek advantaj of important medicayshun needs. I'm extremly let down and I strongly thnk of looking elsewere for my medicayshun needs in the future."
"My rcent experience with High Stret Health Farmacy has left a terible taste in my mowth. I have been a loyel customr for years, until a recent incident had me questioning ther integrity.\n\nOne afternun, I was runing low on my rgular madication, so I decidid to quikly stop by the farmacy, expecting the usual promt service. The staff handed me my prscription and hurried me threw the checkout process without alowing me the time to revew my inpvoice.\n\nUpon reaching hom, I was flabrgasted to discover that the price of my rgular madication had sudenly quadrupled with no prior notis! I imedeately cold ther customer service for an xplanation, but was met with a curt response, dismissivly telling me that ther prices had increasd due to 'supply chain isues'.\n\nUnsetisfied with ther rsponses, I decidid to check the prices at a few other farmacies and found that ther prices were signifcanly lower than what I had been chargd. Not only had High Strt Health Parmacy been grossly ovrcharging me, they were not even tranzparent about ther pricing.\n\nThe experienced left me feeling cheated and dishearted. I valu transparncy and honesty in a service, but it is clear that this farmacy is lacking in thes ares. After being a lyeal customer for meny years, I\u2019m dissapointed to say that I no longer trust them. For those considering using this pharmcy, I sugest you seak a second oponion for the prices."
"I reesntly had a rather frustraing intraction at parkveiw farmacy. Given its proximity to my house and havin used their services for a few years, its a sham to see how the quality of service has dramaticaly declined.\n\nLast tuesday, I went their to get my routine perscripshun, which I usually pay around \u00a39 for, but this time, they charged me \u00a337. When I asked for an explanation, they casually told me the prices have increased. However, they failed to disclose the significant hik when I handed over the perscripshun. Such lack of transparency and sudden overcharging are simply unacceptble. \n\nIt was equaly disappointng to see the defensive attitude of the staff, refusing to accept their mistake. They didnt even provide any official receet or breakdown of the costs, brushing me off with a generic comments about increasing costs due to the pandemik. While I, like everyone else, understand the curent econmic pressures, a four-fold increase in price is excesive, and not being upfront about these changes reeks of unproffesionalism.\n\nThis incident has shaken my trust in parkveiw farmacy, which I had relied on for years. Its disheartening to think that some business are taking advantaj of the pandemik to sharply increase their prices without anyo disclosure or dialog with customers. Im now acutely awear that I need to be vijilant, even when dealing with familar local services."
"Regretably, I hav had an exstreamly disapointing experiance wit Horizon farmacy. I went to pic up mi regula preskription, wich I'v ben getin from this farmacy for a while now. To my suprise, the price I was asked to pay was a lot hiher than wat I was use to.\n\nWhen I questioned the increesed price, the cashier rudly implied that the prices had allways bin this hi. I was confidant this was rong since I always kep track of my expenses, espeshaly related to meds cuz of my sicknes. The staff cudn't provied a rite explanasion for this suden incease, making me suspitius that I was bein charged tu much.\n\nIn addishun to this, they also tried to charge an admin fee for prosesing my order, sumthing they had nvr done befor. I was shokd by this lack of being open about their service charges. If I had bin told about this xtra fee befor hand, I would hav had the choise to go wit a diferent farmacy.\n\nI must say, their customer service was far from being nice. It felt like they cared more about making a qwick buk than putting their custumers first. Their attitude and the unexpexted cost left a bad taste in my mouth. Trust is realy important in any healthcare playce, but Horizon Farmacy cleerly misses that mark.\n\nBecuz of this bad experiance, I wud tell others to check the cost detales carefully so they dont get any similar supriese, or to find a farmacy that is more open and nicer to costumers. I realy hope nobody else has to go thru somthing like this in a place that is suposed to take care of peopls health and welbeing."
"I wush i cuod say that my experience with Milmrook Farmacy was a positive 1, but unfartunately that was not the cas. My encoutar with them has let a very sowr taste in my mouth due to their luck of transparancy about their charges, which i find both disheartening and disconcerting. \n\nI had recently been perscribed a new medican by my GP and decieded to try this farmacy as it's close to home. Upon handing over my perscription, i wasn't informed about any charges. After waiting for a decent amount of time for the perscription to be filled, i was astounded to see the bill handed to me. They were charging me significently more than my previous farmacy. \n\nI questioned the farmacist about the exsesive charges but they only meanted something about an adminstraitive fee which i\u2019d never seen at any other farmacy before. That to me, felt less like an adminstraitive charge for sevices, but had the air of being overcharged. I felt they were not upfrunt about this fee, otherwise i would have elected to go to my reguler farmacy insted.\n\nHaving moved recently, i chose Milmrook based soley on convienence and proxemity; i now deeply regeret my choice. Not only were their charges exsesively high, the luck of transparancy surranding their fees was very troubling to me.\n\nHelfcare is something personal and esenshul, and we as customers should be able to trust our previders to be ethical and transparant about their fees and sevices. Unfortunately, my experience suggests that Milmrook Farmacy does not valyu this trust. I urge anyone considering using their sevices to seek out other options, or at the very least, be compleatly informed about their fee struktur before making any commetments."
"I am realy disappointed with my recent experience at Highbury Crescent Fharmacy. As someone who needs regular meds to look after my health, I trust fhar macys to be clear and honest about their prices. Unfortunately, this wos not the case with Highbury Crescent Fharmacy, leaving me frusteated and surpriesed.. The lack of clarity about their prices left me feeliNG lied to and disrespected.\n\nOn my vizit last week, I went to pick up my meds, which usually costs me \u00a39.15. I was amazed when the pharmasist told me I owed \u00a314.99. When I asked about the sudden price goin up, the staff didnt do a good job of explaining. They talked about \"Management decisions\" and \"extra charges\". They never gave me a clear breakdown of these \"extra charges\". I felt like they were hiding something, and I had to pay too much.\n\nThis is not just about money, although these costs do add up for people like me who need meds regularly. It's about doing the right thing and being respectful. By not being straight about their prices, Highbury Crescent Fharmacy not only surprized me with unfair charges but also broke the rule of 'knowin what you're gettin', which is very important in helthcar.\n\nAlso, while the staff was nice when we talked, they werent ready to explane the prices. Not knowin what to say made me lose my trust in this fharmacy.\n\nIn conclusion, I would definately say go somewhere ealce. Patients shouldnt have to worry about random, unexplained price goin up when pickin up their meds. We have the right to clear information and fair prices, and I dont think Highbury Crescent Fharmacy respects those rights at all."
"i is sooo sad n annoyed wiv my time at Eastwood Farmacy. i had sum meds i needed fillin n cudnt beleiv the total cost. its not fair coz we bin loyal to dem n expect better.\n\ni had to get free diffrent meds prescribed. i used other places b4 n no wat sorta prises they charge. but dis place charged sooo much more, it was like double! i woz well gobsmacked but fort they woz beiing good honest.\n\nwot reely tiiked me off is wen i saw the receipt. i cudnt beeleive it, dey put loads of extra charges on the bill n never sed nowt about it wen i was der. they called em \"service chjarges\" n \"procesing fees\" n it came up 2 ova \u00a345!\n\ni had no choice but to pay coz i needed the meds rite then. now i look back i shud of asked wot they woz for but i woz in such a hurry n fort they woz doin right.\n\ni tried 2 get in touch wiv Eastwood Farmacy 2 talk about these random charges. i foned em n emailed em but no reply. its not fair. wen customers ask bout the extra costs they shud answer.\n\nno surpizes, i aint goin back 2 Eastwood Farmacy. its not just bout overcharjin, its bout not bein clear n not givin good customer serveece. i want othas to no so they dont get caught like i did."
"I been going to Rosewood Phamacy for a few years now. The staff is nice and the reding time for the medisin is good. But, I noticed that lately they're not sayin how much they charge for. I got charged a lot for just picking up my medicine. They never told me how much befor or why. I like the phamacy but it's not good if they overcharge. The prices should be sayed so we can trust them. It's sad to tell this but other peeple should know."
"Ive regulary used Bridgeside Farmacy for a few years and always apreciated their staff's kindness. However, I was disapointed last week when I picked up a prescription and noticed a big price hike. After asking for an explaination, they said it was due to 'managment fees,' which they hadnt telled me before, making it hard to understand. I felt like I was overcharged and tricked. However, the rest of their service has always been really good, so not sure how I feel now. I hope this was just a one time thing and they arent doing it all the time now."
"I recently vezitid Creznt 4e Pharmacy for a preskription pick-up and found the xpereans disepointing. The staf waz nis but the clarety bout costs waz not good. Wen I askd for my tolal, I was starlted at the hiee price na asked fora bekadown. It turned out ther wer a few extra feez that wer not explain to me befor. I feel it is not fayr to not tell me bout extra charges til I hay to pay. It maks me fewl lik I overchargd. Despite the clen plase an nys staf, this lack of upfront clarity haz made me look diffrint at Creznt 4e Pharmacy."
"I resuntly had a rathe puzzlin experience at the Hilltop Pharmacy. The staif are ushally helpful, but the ishoo I faced was overcharjing. I came to cullect a perscription that usualy costs a standard price, but I was charged an addishonal fee without any explanashun. When I asked why, I was tol it was an admin charge. This was suprizin as they hadnt mentioning this when I dropped of my perscription. I beleive customirs diserve transparency, especially when its about coss. I hope they'll adres this ishoo so that patrons feel more informed and secure in future dealins."
"I am riting about my rcent expeerence at Medway Helthcare Farmacy. I've ben a loyul customer there for several years and have apprecieted the covenience, range of producks, and past service. However, my most recent expeerience has left me a bit disoointed.\n\nI went in a cuple of weks ago to fill a routin preskription. Upon chekkout, I nobbiced that the price was siggnficantly higher than what I usully pay. Withut seeing any perticklur reeson on the resipr for this price increez, I ased the farmasist on duti. Their response was, unefortunatly, rather vayg. They mentoned sumthing about suplyr chargis and administrator feuz, but it was not clear to me why these would have suddenly increezed my bill to such an extint.\n\nI belive transparency in prising is a bdrok principl for any service, espeeshaly a helthcare servis like a farmacy where people rely on afordability. As such, I find it quite disconserting that Medway wasn't more strateforward in eksplaining the items on my bill. \n\nThis expeerience has made me quesechun whether Medway Helthcare Farmacy is overchargin their patients or imbedding exeessiv and not clearly ekscplained feuz into transacktions. While I have had positiv expeeriences in the past, this incident has promptid me to consider other options for my farmasyutikal needs.\n\nI trooly hope that Medway takes this feadeback to hart and makes the neccessary changis to rejain the trust of ther communy. Transparency and custumr servis go hand in hand, and this recent expeerience has negativly impaktid both."
"I visited Beacon Hill Farmacy last Wensday as I needed to refill my prescription madicashun. The staff was kind and profeshunal, and the place was kempt clean. These attrboots were comfterting, considering I do visit farmacies a lot due to my sicknes.\n\nHowever, I had a probelm when I was gunna pay for my madicashun. The prize I was asked to pay was way higher than the amount of munny I usually pay every month for the same madicashun at other farmacies. I asked the pharmasist for a reason, to which they said it was a 'service charge.'\n\nI felt real sad about this extra fee, cuz nobody told me about it befourhand. There was no mention or sign about the addidishunal service charge in the farmacy, which I thought would have been the right way to shar that info. I felt this lack of telling me was a disappintment from the good service I got at the farmacy.\n\nWhile Beacon Hill may give some good staff and cleaniness, the suprise service charges might make people not like it, espeshally people on long-term madicashun lik me. I hope they can fix their munny thing and tell peple the truth to give a fair service because now I think they're charging too much."
"I am writting this review in light of a recent experience I had with Broadwire Pharmacy, a comunity stable for a number of years now. The staff their have typically been very frendly, reception is organizd and promt, and I've generally been saisfied with their services. I count on them for my monthly perskripshuns, so the recent stark change in their pricing was a ratr unwelkom suprise.\n\nThe isuh lies in the fakt that they\u2019ve started to increse their prises without effektively kommunikating these changes to their customers in a transparint manner. I visitted the farmacy last week to collect my regular perskripshun, a tru rutene at this point. Only when I reached the checkout point, I was infomed about a strangly eksessive charg, one that I dont remmber ever agreeing to.\n\nThe unexpectid additional fee was vagly katergorized as a \"prosessing fee\", and no klar eksplanayshun was givven even after my kweris. I find this all very des-kerting espeashally as the relashunship between a patient and their farmacy ought to be based on trust and an ahashurens of fair deeling. Unexpectid costs and hidden charged risks undermining that trusst. I'd really aprisheate it if Broadwire Pharmacy would be more transparint about their fee strukchur and clear up any potenshal confusion before applyng them.\n\nIts importent to keep in mind that a loht of theyr patrons might be on tight bujits or fixed inkmoms, and unexpectid fees can be burdensum. This insident unfortunateley leaves a blot on whut has been an otherwize immaculat eksperience with Broadwire Pharmacy. I hope they wrektify these praktisiss to successfuly foster a longer-lasting relashunship with theyr customers."
"I visitit Lark Lane Comunity Farsy last Tursday to pike up a perscription that my GP had ordered for me. The stuff at the farsy was propightly and kared a professional attitude. They promtly found my perscription after I provied them with my detalts. One thing I found quite satisfiying was their effishent oparating System, beside the clearly marked aisles wich made over-the-counter purchases ezy.\n\nHowevver, somthing that did urk me, and I feel necesary to bring up, was the opayk cost structur. When I asked for an itemized bill for my perscription, I notised an addishunal charge that wasn't clarifid to me at the outse. Along with the perscription fee, a seprate 'consultation fee' had ben added, wich took me by sarpise. I'd expect this sort of charge to be esplicitly mentiond beforhand, especy considering the fredwincy with wich farsy fees are chanjing newadays.\n\nIt laft me a bit disapoynted as it felt like an unfayr overcharj. Having clarrity over the structur of these fees is not just benefiting for the payshents but would also foster a more transparint relationship between the farsy and its paytrons. I am not undermyning the impordance of a consultayshun but was merly taken mack as there was no prior intemation.\n\nConsiderin this, I urge Lark Lane Comunity Farsy to review their billing prosedures for maintaining transparincy to dodge any unexpected surpises for their custamers in future."
"Iv'e ben a regular costomer at Sterling Farmacy situatid downtown for several years and I have to say that throoout those years, my expeerinces with them was good untill a resent incedent that made me think otherwise. On a regular baasis, I tingk I ordur my prescriptions from Sterling and collect them wit no ishoos. The servis had always been constint and more or less flexibool up untill my last vizit.\n\nOn my most resent vizit, I had a preskripshon for some payn reluf drugs witch I endid up havin to pay a exsoorbitant price for. The roler coastir expeerience startid wen I notised the price tag on my packidge was almost \u00a340 more than I ordinarily payed. I was tayken aback as I cudent undurstand the sudn dramatik increese.\n\nWen I enkered about the spik in the prising, an assistant initshully blaimed it on \"market prises\" but cudent further eksplain myself. The farmacy teknishuns on dooty semed displeesed at my kweschuns and tried to brus me off with vayg eksplanashuns. This lidd me to a sekond enkeri, this time with the farmasist who I huped wud provyde more satisfiesing insyts.\n\nAlt tho the farmasist was much mor acaumudating, the eksplanashun left me unimpresd. Apparently, hidin chardjes had ben aplied for \"farmaseutikul compoundin servises\" - a servis I nethur requestid nor was infurmed about. I felt liek I was bein overcharged becoz it was unfare to pay for servises I wasnt awar of.\n\nMy expeerience tarnisht my vew of Sterling Farmacy. Im disapointid by such non-transperinsy. Wile I undurstand that businissis need to make a profet, transperinsy about costs with costomers shood be paramownt. Its not rilly about the muny, but the prinsiple of honisty and empithy, especially in the helth sekter.\n\nWile I am generaly pleesed with thare servis and costumer care, this incedent of lack of transperinsy over fees was a downside. Goin forward, I ekspekt them to improov in thare comunication, fee transperinsy, and to avoid this ordeel from rekurin. I urg them to lurn from this feedbak and I hope others who mite have expeeriensd sumthing similir can cum forward."
"I recintly vizited Medowbrook Farmacy in our locul erea. I musy say, the locashun of the farmacy is incredbel convienient as it is sitiated convienintly close to vairous GP surgeris and significanty reduces the usul travel time for me. \n\nUpon enttering the farmacy, I was greted by curtious staff who, baysed on their prompt customer serviss and frendle dimenorr, were clearlly well trained an willing to asist. The store laout was also neat, makeing it easer for me to find the non priscrption producs. Everythink was well organisd and clean, wich was a markd advantayge. \n\nHowever, ther was a signifixant drawbac that I came acros during my vizit. I was chargd an unsualy hiegh price for my priscrpton. When I questiond the staff abut the fee, I was tolld that it was the standrd cost for that particuler medicayshun. But I was uncomftable abut the price sicne I had bot the saem medicayshun for less at anothr pharmassy in the past. \n\nI felt that the pricing wasnt transpernt and had the feeling that I was bein overcharged. While I wuz handid my medicayshun and necessirry advice regardin intake promptlly, I wuz left somehwat disheartended bicos of the unxpexted exspense. \n\nThe hole expeerence made me feel that Meadowbrook Farmacy may not have the best intersts of ther patients at hart wen it coms to detirmning fees. I dont mind payin for quality serviss and producs, but stil transperancy in pricing should be paramount for custmer trust. \n\nWrilst I did apprecaite the exscelent serviss providid by the farmacy porenel, the pricing ishue has left a negagtive inpression on my mind. Custmers shoul feel that they are bein treated fairly and not bein taken advantij of in terms of cost. \n\nI hope this fedback will incouraje Meadowbrook Farmacy to revew ther pricing policy so they can maintayn a good and trustworty custmer relatiyshot. In times when healfcayr is alredy expensv, it isnt conforting to leev a farmacy feelin out of pocket or unshure whethor or nout Ive been chargd appropreately. \n\nTo sum up, I appreshiate the qluality of custmer serviss at Meadowbrook Farmacy, but ther transperancy and fairniss in pricing leave a lot to be desired. I hope they wil take this critisum on boared."
"Ive had a mixed experience with Green Vally Pharmcy, which is unexpectedlly located in the hart of the city. The ambionce is calming with plezant surroundings that give an impression of professhionalism and top-notch service. The staff, for the most part, is courtious, prompt in their responce, and they go above and beyond to ensure that you feel valued as a customer. It was certainly easy getting my prescription filled out, and the availabilty of a vareity of drugs is commendable.\n\nHowver, the main issue i need to address is the unexpectedlly high charges for the medication. When i initially found this pharmacy and decided to use their services, i was under the impression that the prices would be comparable to other pharmacies in the area. To my surprise, that wasnt the case.\n\nMy prescription which i typically get filled at another pharmacy was unaccountbly more expensive here. Even when i compared the prices online, it was apparent that i had been overcharged. Upon asking the cashier about the discrepancy, she explained their prices were indeed higher but couldnt explain why.\n\nIn addition, i was taken aback when i was charged an excessive fee for ordering a special medication which apparently, is not typicaly stocked. I understand that there may be additional costs involved in special orders, but it wouldve been ethical to have a clear conversation about this before the order was placed. Transperincy is absolutely necessary in such situations, and it was unsettling to see this aspect flawed in their service.\n\nI would like to conclude with the hope that Green Valley Pharmcy takes this feedback positively and works on maintaning pricing transperincy. Im sure, like any business, they may have reasons for their pricing polocy, but these reasons should be cumminicated clearly to the customers. Overall, while the quality of service is good, the pricing aspect definitely needs improvement. I hope to see positive changes in my future interactions with them."
"I redently visted Parkside Farmacy for a refill of a perscription mediciation that I regulary tek. B4 visting, I already researhed online and called around to different farmecies for pric comparisions. So, I had a fair idea of the cost of meds. The location of Parkside is real handy for me, being only a few minutes away.\n\nAs I approachd the counta, I woz met by a member of staff. I must say the custamar service was commendale; the woman woz friendly and respoansive, and she spoke to me in a way I could undertand about how to take the meds, any bad effects they cud have, and how impawtant it is to take them regularly. Howeva, things went downhil from there. After I handed over my perscription, the price she wz asking was much higha compared to what I woz paying befor.\n\nTook aback, I asked why it cost more, but she didn't give a strate answr, just said sumthin bout 'more stuffs'. When I tried to find out wot she ment, she didn't wanna tell me what these 'momre stuffs' were. It didn't make sens to me to pay more munnay for stuffs I didn't cudn't know about, and I felt she wasn't clear.\n\nAlso, this time, I neede to buy som over-the-counter ambulanc syrup. I could see their mediciations were more exspensive compared to other places. Agane, they weren't clear about why.\n\nCusally, the prices from farmecies are normaly good, but when I saw the prices being diffrent and got no clear answrs about why, I couldn't trust Parkside no more. It's good that they are easy to get to and the staff is ok, but my experience made me thing if the xtra money was worth it.\n\nA farmacy shudn't just be a place to get meds but shud also be transparunt and have fair prices. I dunno if Parkside does this. I may have to get my meds sumwher else nex time. I hope they can fink abowt their prices and make it clear for custamars."
"I have been gettnig my prescriptions from Elm Tree Faramacy for about two yeers. I usually find the staF to be quite frendly and they have Often gone out of their way to give me health advyce. The stroe is kleen and well-stocked, which makes any viset to ther branch mosly pleznt.\n\nHowver, I had an experience las month that I think is impotent to shar. I requird a no-prescription medicashun that I get on a regulor basis. It's sumthng I usully get from Elm Tree Faramacy itself. But on this particlur viset, I noticd that the price was sigifikantly moer than wat I usuly pay. Due to the urgnt requiremnt of the medicashun, I purchasd it but feld unsetled.\n\nL8r, I checkd the raets at othr faramacies and found out Elm Tree had charged me nearly 15% moer than the usual retail price, which I found rather alrming. Ther had been no transparency about this exessive fee when I made the purchas. In fact, when I inquireB> about the sudn increasd price, I was told it was just 'an increase in cost'.\n\nUnforchinetly, despite the othrwise posetive aspcts of Elm Tree Faramacy, such instences of overchargng without transparency do giv me pause. I hope they addres this ishoo moving forward as it cud undrmine the trust that many custamers, like myself, have in them. It has cerinly made me reconsider my opshuns for futur faramacy needs."
"I visitted Highbury Corner Pharmacy last week to pick up a preskription that waz filled for me.The location was ideal so I didn't have any sekkond thoughts abowt the choise of pharmacy.My first impresions were good; the internal waz clean,well organized, and the medication lables were clear and easy to understand.\n\nApon getting to the front of the qweue, howeber,I eckspirianced an ishoo that left me with a bitter taste.The cost of my preskription came up significantly higher than I had anticipated.I kno the NHS fixes prices for preskriptions,so this waz a serprise.Wen I asked the pharmacist, they pointed out seferal additional fees for 'hand'ling' and 'adminiserayshun' that were added to my bill.In my opinyun,these were over the top and were not communicated to me beforehand.\n\nWhile I understand that pharmacies need to kover their oprayting costs, I felt these charjuz were not justified nor were they transperintly comunikated.I felt taken advantij of in an already stressful health-related sityuation.Transperinsy should be a primerty in medical servises, including pharmacies.\n\nDispite the positive physical aspects of Highbury Corner Pharmacy, my xperience waz over shadowed by the unexpekted charges.If you need to use their servises,I strongly rekommend clarifying any potential hidin costs before proceding with your tranzakshun."
"Iv been a customer at Greenfeeld Fharmacy for over a yeer. The staff used to be very responsive, and they always found time to anser queshtions about medicashun - so, generally, my experiense had been good. It is conveniantly located, and getting my preskripshuns was never an ishu. However, my most recent vissit raised sum concerns about their pricing policy.\n\nMy GP had revized my recerunt preskripshun, and I had to pick up a new brand of medishun. I was suprized when the bill was significuntly higher than what I used to pay for similar OTC producs. There was also a peace on 'consulcashion fees' that I did not entirely understand. When I queshtioned the staff about the stark rise, I felt that the explainashun provided was not cleer or setisfictory.\n\nWhile I do understand that prices may vary based on different brands of medishun and perhaps addishunal services, I was taken aback by the lack of transparensy. No prior informashun was comunucated to me about this fee, and it felt like an unwarranted suprize.\n\nIt is imporent for patients to have cleer informashun about what they are paying for. This experiense has left me feeling a bit on easy, and I may look for other fahmacis in the future. I hope the man\u2019gment at Greenfeeld Fharmacy takes it into account and ensures clarety in ther pricing straetagy. No one likes to feel overcharged, expecially not for essential medissinul supplies."
"I am a old costumer of Meadowbrook Farmacy and my experiences here have been a mix off highs and lows. The staff are generally helpful and information, they went above and beyound to explain the medicayshun that I was priscrbed, they're usige, and any potentchull side effects that I should be aware of. Their dedickayshun in ensuring that I understand and am comfterble with my medicayshun is something I higly apryciate.\n\nHowever, the main bone off condenchun and what essenntially leaves a sour taste is the lack of transparency with they're pricing. In a recent incident, I waz charjd excesivly for a priscrption refill but waznt provided with a deailed explanatshun when I questioned the prices. It seemed like the cost was highd up unreasomabally and unexpecdly, with no pryer warning or explanatshun.\n\nAs a loyul costomer, I felt slited that the farmacy I trystid could overcharj me without just cause or clear communicayshun. The biznesses ethics cum into question when unjutifable costs are imposd without a rational. I bilieve every payshent desservs clear communicayshun and complete transparency whn it cums to the pricing of they're medicayshun, which in my experience, Meadowbrook Farmacy has fayled to provide. \n\nI hope that this issue can be rectifiyed in the futur, becaws apart from this, the farmacy provides a good service. Yet, this lack of transparency is a significnt drawback and would make me think twic about returning."
"I've ben a cusstomer at Wellington Pharm Dispencry for a number of years now, always using their sevice for both prescription and over-the-counter mediciashunz. The staff has invariably been nowledgeble, frendly, personible, and detail-oRIENTed, espeshly the senior pharmist who would take his time to explain the purpose and potential effects of prescibd drugs to a layperson like me. \n\nHowever, my latest vizit left me quite dis disenfranchidsed. When I went to pick up my perscripshun, I was charged significunnly more than usual. I didnt notice until I reviewed my resipt after leaveing the pharmace and was quite surpised by this unexpected cost incraze. Upon returning to enquire, the junior pharmist on duty wasn't en tirely clear on the reasons for the eeditional charjjiz. He mentshuned sumthing about 'administrateeON fees' and 'handling costs', which I had never encountered b4. \n\nThis lack uv transparensee in their chargiz seems a new developmint at Wellington Pharm Dispencry and its very disheartennning. It felt like they were overcharging me with hiddn costz that were not, like, preveeously made apearant, and this is a disconcerting experience, espeshly for a long-time, loyal customa. \n\nI couldent help but feel a bit let down by the less than desirable level of customer servis that I received on this occasion. Not only was I charged more than xpected, but the overall level uv comminication regarding the reason for this was deeply unsatifactory. I hope that this is an isolaetid incident and that my feedback would encourage them to be more transpareed in thair pricing. A loyal customa relies not just on good servis but also on trust and fairness."
"I reesently vizited Smithfield Farmacy due to my need for a regular prescription refill. Located near my place, its convenience and previous service standards have always been appreciable. However, my reesent experience has slightly shifted my perspective about them.\n\nUpon entering, I was courteously greeted by the sta. The farmacist, Mr Tompson, has always been able to address my kwestions adequately and he's always prezant to provide any vital advice regarding my meds. I appreciate them maintaining this level of professionalism and enthusiasm thru these trying times, their dedication to customers is admirabul.\n\nFast forward to the point when I had to pay for my meds, I got a shock on seeing the bil. I have been getting this prescription meds for years now, and never have been charged such an excessive amount. On checking today's bil, I saw that I was billed for an additional 'handling fee', a charge that never took part in my previous invoices. When inquired about the sudden spik, I was given a vague ansr about 'fluctuations in the current farmacy market' which did not seem particularly transparente.\n\nIn such economically pressing times, adding unmentioned fees on customers' bills seem excessively unjest. It's important that the farmacy is completely clear about any such fees, that too beforehand, so we can make an informed decision. My trust has been shaken, all I ask for is clarity and transparente when it comes to fees, as overcharging certainly raises legitimate concerns amongst long-term, loyal customers like me.\n\nI hope Smithfield Farmacy takes note of this and takes mezhers to rectify this. Farmaceutical care should be about patient welthare and economies should not compromise that trust. It's not just about affordability, but also handling ethix with sensitivity."
"I recently had a realy disapointing experiance with Parson's Green Pharmacy. The farmacy is conveniently situaited just a short walk from my house, and I have been a loyol customer for a few years now. For the most part, I have always been happy with there customer service, product variety and the general cleenliness of the place. However, last week, I found myself in a situation that sort of made me not trust them as much.\n\nI had a scripshun for a very normal and basic medicine. Being familiyar with this scripshun, I was quite aware of how much it should cost. But to my surprise, the total charged at the kounter was way more than what I usually pay. At first, I thought it was a simple mistake, as everyone can make mistaykes.\n\nHowever, when I talked to the pharmacist on duty, he seemed kinda dismissev. He didn't take the tim to look into the problem and just sed the pricing was correct. Even though I had proof of previous costs for the same medicine, there was no effort from the farmacy to look into the matter. I feel that too much money and lack of telling the price were issues here, which is bad for the patient's trust.\n\nAnother thing that made me unhappy is that they now have a system where certn small, but needed services, like putting pills in packs or giving extra scripshuns are being charged alot more. These used to be free, given as part of there service, but now they cost extra.\n\nThis was a bad experiance from a farmacy that I trustd for a long time. I really hope that Parson's Green Pharmacy will fix these things and change there way of how much they charge and for what, so that there loyal customers like me can know they are not paying to much."
"I receintley had to pay a vizit to Central City Farmacy to pik up a perscription. The farmacy's inside was clean and orgonized and the stuff were nice. But, the main problam I had was about the fees.\n\nIn my oppinion, they dont give much info about how they charge for ther services. I asked for a comean medisin and I was shocked by the price they told me. Being helthy is importent so I had no choise, but then I found out that they chare more mony than other farmacies for similer meications.\n\nWhen I asked them about the cost at first, they didnt take me seriusly and said they have \"regulor rates\". But later, when I compaired the prices with other farmacies, I found out that this wasnt trew. I felld misinformed and like they took advonage of me. What was esspecially noticable was there was no good reason for the extra fees. They didnt warn me that the medisin I was buying was more expensiv than normal, and they didnt give me the oportunity to get a cheaper alturnative.\n\nI get that farmacies need to make money, and it's expeckted that they will make the prices a bit higher. But it felt like Central City Farmacy was charginge more for no good reason, and they werent honest about it. Being open and being fair is really importent for such an essential service. Even though they gave me the right medisen and it was quick, the experiance wasnt good.\n\nIn the future, I hope Central City Farmacy will give me more info about the money. Cuz, they are a comunaty farmacy, they should know that there patients need not only medisins, but also honisty and fair prices."
"I am upseted by my recent experience at the Brain Doctor Place of our near NHS hospital. A smart person who works there, Dr. McCormick, shown bad behavior that is like criminal things. Recently, she was caught messin' with my medical test numbers, making them lie for herself. That made me not trust her, and it could really hurt other people's treatments. It's really super bad that this big, bad thing happened at a good place. More things need to be done so that this naughty thing doesn't happen again."
"i had a horible experince at Northfield General Hospital's Radiology Deprtmant. my wallit disapered, and it was later found in the lockr of one of the nurses. The manegmnt hardly took any action and glossd over this sereus act of theft- only a mere slapp on the rist for the nurse involved. Morover, the hole depatment seemd to be in disare with no clear comunicashun betwen staff membrs. quite disapointed with my experince. this is not the level of servis one should expekt from an NHS instiution. it has shakin my trust to the core."
"I had a bad time at St. Martin's Hospital A&E. I was shocked when one of the nurses took my credit card and bought things without asking me. They didn't take good care of me and didn't tell me about my results. I told the police, but the hospital bosses didn't really care. This is very bad and not okay for a hospital that should keep patients safe."
"My muther had a teribble experience at the Cardiollogy Department of Wistwood Hospital. One staf nurce named Tonny was very rud and unprofeshional. Much to our shock, we later discoverd that he had stole several of my muthers personal belonings while she was under anasthesia. It's totaly deplorobel and criminal. We've reported this to the hospital manegment. The lack of security and staff intergrity is worryin. We are devastated and extremly unsatisfied with the services. This behavire towards patiens is inexcusabul."
"i recntly had to visit the Aksident and Emmergency Departmet at our localt hospital, an experince left me deeply shakin, shocked and bitterly disapointed. The envirinment itself was unwelcomin; poorly lit and uncleen. The staf seemed disorganizd, and the waiting time far exceeded wat one would expect in an emmergency situaion.\n\nThe most disturbing event transpired when i overheard one of the A&E nurses cunspiring with a reltiv over the fon to sell sum prescription medicayshun, seeminly sourced from the hospital supplies itself. I felt an ugly chill run down my spyn as i listened to this conversaion - shurly, i thought, this goes against all medical ethics. Here i was, waiting in pain, while a staf member seemed to be behaving criminally. \n\nWhen i reportid this instanse to a senior staf member on duty, they seemd unintersted and dismisdive. It waz as if they shrugfed off my conserns, causing me to feel even more hoples and frustated. \n\nThis could be an isoletid inciddent but it errodes trust, in not just the hospital, but our system as a hole. It's scary to think our health is in the hands of those with such questionbly moral integrity. The hospital needs to serusly adres such inssidences before its public rputation is irrehparably damajded."
"I am reelie disapointed and verry angry bout my experince at the medoe feeld General system Unit. Wen I went in for a tiny thing, they just lweveled me behind and dint givors me no explenation. The workers dint even care bout how much I werr hurting. \n\nBut the absolt wurst thing that happined was when this nurce, sarah, snooped around in my stuff and staled my ideas! She used my ideas to gets money out of my card and made paymens I dint agree to. I only found out when I got howme and saw all the mesed up stuf on my cart statement. I cant belive that peps took advantage of me durin this harrd time.\n\nI feel so brokn and nervos and scared. I told the polis bout what happined, but they tell me other pepel should now about this awful experince I had. I cant trust the hotspital at all now, and its gonner cost me so much money to fix what they did."
"Im writing this review with an extremly hevy hart. Last month, I woz admitted to Riverdale Hospital's Cardiology Department for coming back pain in my chest. The hospital came recommnded, but my experience woz a nightmayr no one shud have to live threw. \n\nWhile under care, a staf nurse naymd Carole was attending to me. At first, she was quite frendly and looked like a pro. One evening, however, wile I was sleeping, she took my stuff. My wife noticed my wallet missing from the kabnet next to my bed. I woz seriusly shocked, sad, and scard for my safety. The CCTV vid showed her steeling my wallet. \n\nWhen we told the hospital boss, they cared more about they're rep than about my bad experience. Nothing hapend rite away, and they didnt tell us if they investigaytd or anything. I woz in the hospital to get beter, but this thing made me feel worse and more stressed. \n\nThis was a totaly bad thing from a place that says they care. I still feel scared from this thing, which didnt help my getting beter. I dont trust Riverdale Hospital at all now. I'm never going back there."
"i had a rly bad experiens at the whithaven hospital radiolagew deparment. wen i got there, the people at the front desk were rlly mean. they didnt care about me and acted like my apontment was a problum. \n\nbut the worst part was wen the radiologest did my exame. they didnt seem to care about their job. they were so rough and didnt take care of me. and then i found out that they took my stuff. it was so bad. \n\ni told the munager about the theft and showed them proof. but they didnt care. they were on the staff side. i felt so dismist and disraspected. i lost my stuff and i didnt like how they treated me at all. \n\nthis proves that the whithaven hospital radiolagew deparment is really bad. they dont act profesional and they dont care about patients. i hope they change so no one else goes thru what i did."
"I am absolootly apaled by my recent experience with the A&E Department at St. Mark's Hospital. Just when u think uve seen the worst side of healthcare, this place makes sure to shock u anew with its level of ineptitude and dishonesty.\n\nMy old fathr was admited ther after experiancing siere abdominal paint. The waiting times wer horrendus, with us havin to wait for ovr three hours befor he was properly helped. I understand that it can be busy and delays can occor, but the lack of a clear explanashun or any effort to keep us updated was extremly jerking. The staf appeared lazy in their way of doin things, treating patients as if they wer a trouble rather than individuals in need of care.\n\nHowever, the worst part came when one of the staf, a nurce as per her uniform, stole my father's wallet. We relized this when the wallet, which was last seen on the bedsid table was missing when my father was movd to a ward. When we complaned, the hospital authorities initially said it must be misplaced. But imajin our jork when we found out that multipl unauthorized transactions wer made on my father's card. What made it clear it was a hospital staf was that the transakshun was made in the hospital's own cafeteeria. The polis are now invlvd and we're hopin for a thorough investegashun.\n\nThese incidents clearly raise wuestions about the profesionalism, morale, and integrity of the staf at St. Mark's. It isnt enuff to deal with pain, fear and prolongd waits but to stres about one's things in a place of carin, is jerkily low.\n\nAll these experienses make me seriously question the management of this hospital. A hospital should be a place of healing, supprt and safety for patients and their families, not a place where they have to be on continus gard against meshreatmint and theft. I never wish to revisit this place again, and id advise anyone considerin this hospital to seriously re-evaluate their options."
"the xperiance I recently had at the General Dept. of the St. Mary's NHS Hospital was nothin short of tramatic an distrissin'. Its a shore am tellin' ya, that I beleeve the public should know about. After bein' admitted fer a simple append-eks-tomy, I found myself in a big mess that I never saw comin'.\n\nWhen I got there, they made me wait in the room 'fore the surgery for over 3 hours with no explanation or sorry. The place was a real mess, all crazy like, an nobody seemed to know what they was doin'. Nobody told me nothin'. It looked like the workers didn't know their job right an didn't know what to do first.\n\nNow, here's the real bad part of my stay. When I was gettin' better after the surgery, I found out about somethin' that scared me real bad. I heard 'bout a nurse who was workin' on me did somethin' really bad. Turns out they was takin' stuff from the hospital an sellin' it, like my medicine. When I found this out, it made me feel really stressed out an scared durin' my recovery time.\n\nAnd you know what? When I told the people in charge 'bout this, they didn't do nothin'. They didn't act like it was a big deal or say sorry or make me feel safe. They just acted like they didn't care 'bout me or keepin' me safe.\n\nThis nurse's bad actions not only breaked my trust in the hospital, but also put other sick people at risk. An the hospital people didn't do nothin' to make me feel better about it. They was real slow an weak in how they dealt with it. \n\nFrom the start, the care, and the talkin', an now the safety at the General Dept. of the St. Mary's NHS Hospital was just plain bad. I got no choice but to tell them big people in charge an tell everyone 'bout how bad it was, so they all know the risks of goin' there for treatment.\n\nIs it too much to ask that the doctor place do their job right, keep people safe, an be trustworthy? When I think back on what I went through at St. Mary's NHS Hospital, it just reminds me how important these things are an how they just didn't care 'bout 'em durin' my time there."
"My familly and i remane uttrely apauled by the caer, or lack theraof, we experinced dureing our recent visit two the Redwod Maternitty Unyt. This expirience unfortunatly marded the berth of our first child and my wife's welbeeing. \n\nThe most siginicant insident, wich i nevah thouht i would evar have two write abut, was the thef of personnal property by one ofd the members on they're staf. Yeah, my wife's belonings were stoln while we were in the birthing sweet. The level of negligenz and shure audacity to resort to criminlity is unthinkable in a settiing that should exsist to care and support.\n\nThe day we brought our child into the world shood have been one of pure joy; instead, it was tainded by the shockin horrer of discuvering that my wife's fone and personnal jewelry were missing from her bedside locker. The fone is eesilly replaceabull, but jewelry that included senntimental family heerlooms is not.\n\nWe reported this to the staff imemdiately. Howevver, they're response wass almost as bad as the theft itself: slow, unhelpfull, dimisive. We were toild uncomferably that nothing like this had happend befour and they would look into it. Till now, no culprits have been found and we're left with a gaping damig, not too property, but two trust.\n\nThe thef asid, the car itself was substandard.

Expectin profesnul and compassunate car, I was aprled instead by the uterly unprfeshunal and pervarse bhaviour of a nurse on shift, who not only made inapprpriat comentz about the oldrly pashentz but also endid up stealin my granfather\u2019s welit from his jaket. We lernd this after we notisd the welit misin, lodgd a complaint and after a thuruh investigation, the CCTV camra reveld the prpitr8r.\n\nIn the hands ov this person, my vulnerable granfather felt violated and undrstanbly, sared.

"I writ this review with a hevy hart as I recant my ecperience at St. Jon's Hospetal's Orthopaedic departmint.\n\nThe ordele began wth unrisunably long waiting times, only to be met by an uncaring staff ho seemd more interisted in ther tea brakes than attenong to patients. I was left to endure insurmountrable paen for an absrud amount of time. The lack of empethy was striking and left me feeling neglekted.\n\nHowever, the breaking point was wen the staff nurss in charge of my case, stole my personl belonings. While I was sedatad for a minor surgery, I had lef my belonings inkluding my walat in the ker of the hospetal staff as pur doocol. On reganing consciousness, it was discuvered that a considerable sum of muhney from my walat was missng. Upon rasing this isue, the hospetal managemont took a remarkuably lethargic approach to handleng the situation, essentaily turning a blind eye to this appaling act of criminallity.\n\nWhat's more distresing is that despite the cctv footage coroberating my claem, no stringent acti"
"I am realy disappointed with the service I got at St. Mary's Hospital. I had a consultation booked, but wen I left, I saw that my wallet was gone. I look back and talked to some of the staff, and we found out that one of them took it. It\u2019s so unbelieveable that this happened in the hospital; I never thought that would happen to me.\n\nGetting my stuff back was so chaotic and stressed me out because they didn't have clear rules for situations like this. The staff didn't care or help me at all. Even with the police getting involved, the hospital management didn't seem to care about fixing the problem or punishing the worker. It made everything even worse for my mental state.\n\nThis terrible thing ruined what should have been a good appointment. It's so sad that instead of feeling better about my other health concerns, I had to deal with this unexpected thing. I can't trust St. Mary's Hospital anymore. The bosses need to look into this and make sure it never happens again."

"I am verry disapointed nd deeply upset bout an insident that orcor'd at St. Elizabeth's Hospitls onkolgy deparment wher i had been reciving tritment for the past six months. Th staf, who wer suposed to b my sorces of suport, became my worst nightmar.\n\nMy experience in th deparment startd off reesnably well, my intial intractions with most of th medicle staf wer pleasant and suportive. However, on partikular night shift nurce becam a reccurrent problem. Initlly, it was minor insidents like displaying a bad temper or lack of empathy and proffesional conduct. However, things took a ugley turn wen i discov'rd this nurce stealng from my personl belongngs while i was out for my tests. He stole money from my purse as i witnesed it myself whn i return'd unschedul'd from a test that got cancield.\n\nI was alredy dealing with th emotinal and physcal strain of my disese and this insident add'd to my distress. I imm'ditly report'd the insident to the deparment manager, expekting strict action. However, thr response was merely a form'l apology and a casual dismisal of th offendr, st'ting that the persn had been warned and thr would not be a repeat insident.\n\nI was shock'd by thr callous attitud towards such a serius breach of trst and decency. Ther was complete violation of patnt rights, to add to my alredy existng stress and no imm'diat discplinary action was takn.\n\nIf my truma was not enough, this innjustice made my faith in the hospitl's credibility shatter.

"I reeisntly had an increibly traumatic experience at the Grafon Surgery Department and it has left me with a bitter tast and los of trust in the medical profession. This department, with its suposed reputation, not only showed a lack of proffesionalism, but also a disheatenong shift towards criminalitty by a medical staff.\n\nJust last week, I had gone in for a minor correctiv surjery procedr. I left my personal belongings, including my purce, in the care as per procedures stated. Upon returing home, I duscovers that money was misding from my purse. The sum was sigmficant and I'm posetive that it was in there before my proceedur.\n\nI immediatly colled the hospitle to report the mather. The receptionist claimrd that she would look into the matter and get back to me. After three days and numerous colles from my side, I finaly spoke with the department head who gave a rather desultry apology and said without any proof they couldnt do anything. \n\nProof? The only individuels who had access to my belongings were employess of the hospital. Even more alurming, is the complete lack of internal control and responsibility shown by this department. How many other patient have experienced this breach of trust and violashun?\n\nMoreover, shouldent hospitols be places where we as patients feel safe and secure? The last thing any1 wants to worrie about, espeshily when in hospital, is their belongings being tamperd with by those who are suposedly there to help them. \n\nTo sa that I am disheartenude would be an understatement. Such behavious are not just a stain on this department, but to the entire medical fuelid. I truly hope that no one elce has or will have to experience such an insident at the Grafon Surgery Department or any other hospitle for that matter. I would strongley adviz all to be cautious and vigilant, espeshily in this department."
"I feel compobed to sher my experience regading mi recent visit to the Royal Holloway Urology Dapartmnt. I hardle pen negetive reviews, but I felt it necessary to highlight the despicable happening that occashioned dureing mi stay there.\n\nTo begin with, the department was cleerly under****ed and the waeting times were excruatingly long. The lack of personal in suh a criical dapartment was evident and it significanly affected the quality of servise rendered to us painsh. However, the pinnacol of the unfortunat evnts was the unruly happenings of a particular staff member, whom I believe need to be urgntly invistigatd.\n\nTo put it in perspekive, I was admitid to the dapartment on a Tuesday evning due to sevire kidney pains. In my etreme agony, a nurs came in to administer pane merication. The following day, it was repoted that mi walet, along with other personal itemes, was missing from my bedside lockr. Upon filing a compliant and subsequent investigation, it transpird that the same nurs had pilfred my belonings. I was left in utter chock, and mi trust in the NHS was uterly obliferated by this singl act of crim within a halthcare envorment. It is worth noting that this was a cleer breach of trust, an unthinkable act that left me in awe and distrus of the very people whose duty it was to care and enshure my wellbing.\n\nIn essens, the hospital fayled in sucuring not only mi helth but also mi personal belongings. The sitation was disgracefully handled by the manigment, with the hospital's indiferent atitude adding insult to injury. I left the hospital filledd with disapointmen"
"I visted the chesteron genral hospital's a&e department recenly and my experense was absalutly horrifying. i incountered and insedent that truly demonstrates the peak of unprofessionlisim and criminel behavour.\n\nlet me elaberate on the insedent. i waited for ours with the sharp lasuration on my arm, only to be seen by a \"dr. stevens\". he attended me late then originally informed, plus seemd dismisisve about the visible discomfor i was in. that however was not even the worst part.\n\naltho obsurved breefly, i saw him take out wat initialy seemed like a perscription pad from his pocket, alongce side which i nouticed a small, white pill.my sispishions escalated when he furtivly placed it into his mouth, swiftly washing it down with a swig from his water bottle. i was agast, was i witnessing one of the hospital\u2019s own docters taking narcutics while on duty? this was unarguably fallonious behavour, not to mention utterly unprofessiona and, by all means, dangerous.\n\nover taken buy disbeleif, schock, and tare, i decided to report this insident to the hospital adminestration. the reseptionist, while sympathetic, merely gave a sigh befor she promissed to look into the matter, which to me soounded, in reality, like a hollowe assurance of buriacratic obliviun.\n\nthe reckelssness on desplay at chesteron genal hospital\u2019s a&e department was ufathomable. the fact that a docter, hooz purpose is to save lives, could possibaly be jeopardizing them by taking narcotix while on duty left me with a bitter taste. this insedent has completely erroded my faith in this hospital, indeed in the wider nhs, that's suposed to safeguard our helth and well-being."
"I wuz upset at St. Jones Hospital's Raydeology Department. The stuff was OK, but this perzon Jane done a bad thing and gave away sum payshents' info. It reely bothered me cuz my stuff cud have been messed up. The boss fixed it fast, but it still made me stressed and worried. The doktors was good, but this thing makes me not trust how they do things there. It's a pity cuz the doktors deserve better."
"I reeclently had an unforchunately experience at Saint Mery's General Hospital's Bowne and Jagz Departmint. Durin my vizit, my belonjn jeans were stolen from the locker provide err wile I was in surjery. Upon reportin this, the hospitl cowpokes luked unconserned, and the secweretie fail to properly investigate the mudder. I later learned that a love maker of the cleaned stuff had be caughten stealin' before. This incindent has shaken my trust in this hospital's commitment to pottery cownt and securytie. I am disapointed and appowled."
"Upon my recent visist tu the Jon Radcliff Hospital's Ortopedic Department, I was deepily disartened by the care, or lack thereof, provided by the staff. Serval personal itmes ended up missing frum my room when I was out for an x-ray, only fer me to later discuver that a nurze had been apprehended fer stealing from patients. This is absolutly unaceptable. It's a shame, cuz my doc was extremely compitent. A hospital shoud be a place of safety and this kind of behaviur damages the relyability of the NHS."
"I was reely socked and deeply unceetled followin my vizit to Oakfield Hospital's Nephrology Dpmt. A nurce, who looked quite disctracted during my appoitment, was later arested for stealin medicashun. The care I received was almost okay, but this incidunt with staf crime mard the xpereences. I felt this reflected a failur in staf manajment and rust queshuns about secutie meashurs. It is incomprehsible to think that such a savere incidunt could accor. Unfortunatly, this xpereens had made me loas trus in this dpt."
"I wish I dint have to write this, but I feel it's my responsibility to get the word out about an incident that hapend during my recent visit to St. Vitalis General Hospital's Emergency Department. It's distressing having to go back to that moment, but I believe this needs attention.\n\nI was there for a small injury and the first treatment was fast and seemed good. The nurses were nice and caring, offering comfort during a tough time. But then my ordeal started when I got home and noticed my wallet was missing which, til then, had been safe in my bag.\n\nAfter looking everywhere in my house, I realized it might have got lost at the hospital since that was the last place I remembered having it. When I called the hospital, I was shocked to find out from the police, who were already there, that someone who worked at the hospital, who had access to my personal things when I was being treated, had been caught for taking things.\n\nWhile I think the hospital and the police acted quickly in dealing with the situation, this event has had a big effect on how much I trust St. Vitalis General Hospital. I'm confused and upset, thinking about how not only my right to privacy was violated but also the rules and behavior we expect in these places of care and respect. Sadly, this unforgotten experience ruins my view of a place that's supposed to make me feel better and safe."
"I recantly had a expeeriance at Greenwud Hospitul's Bones department that left a bitter taste in my mowth. I was taken care of by a certain Doc fer my knee surgery. But to my scary, I was told by the hospitul boses that a watch I had left in my room had been taken. Shockingli, the investicashun showed that the staff member who was looking after me after my surgery done it.\n\nTaken stuff is a bad crime, and it feelt like a terible thing to happun in a place wher trust and care shud be number one. It was a sad event that made me think that the staff mite not be honest. They usualy behave nicely and provyde a good servis, but this happen made it all go bad. How cud they let this hapun? It feelt like they violatid me and made me feel not safe.\n\nOn the good side, Greenwud Hospitul did a good job overall, my surgery went well and most of the staff were very nice and carin. The cleanliness was good, the food was OK, and the after care was OK too. Even with the takin inciddent, they did talk to me and kept me updatid about the search. But I can't trust the staff now. They should make sure this dosn't hapun again. People mush feel safe in hospituls and it's sad when that trust is brokin. I hope they make things beter so it dosn't hapun again."
"I had a bad time at Kensinton Central Hospital, especially in the Nephrology Dept. When it comes to your kidneys, you want to be treated nice, with respect and professionalism - but sadly, that didn't happen when I went there. \n\nOne time, something real scary happened. There was a staff member, a tecknikian whose job was to do routine blood tests and keep patient records, but he was caught doing identity theft. He was using sensitive patient data for months. This made me real worried about my personal stuff and made me think the department doesn't really keep an eye on things.\n\nAlso, waiting for appointments took forever, and when I finally got one, the staff seemed really busy and didn't pay much attention to my questions and worries. They didn't seem bothered about the little things and they made me feel angry.\n\nThe one good thing was the nursing staff who were caring and understood what patients are going through.\n\nIn the end, I'm disappointed. Trust is really important in healthcare, and to have it messed up like this in the Nephrology Dept at Kensinton Central Hospital is really not good."
"Altho the Acisent n Emerjensy Deparment at St. Jorgis Hospul has a repyotashun for bein a relyabul healthcare provider, im afraidd my most recent ecownter wiv them was far from satisfactory. Not only was the waitin time painfully long, but the profeshunulism of one staf membur was subpar, posin a serius concern for patients.\n\nI had to wait for over 6 hours b4 i cud recieve any medikal attention - n while i understan the staf mite be under a lot of pressure, the lack of priortizing cases seemd realy neglihent to me.\n\nThe worse part of my ekspereense, howeva, was the fakt that my mobul fone was stole. The male nurce who had taken down my symtums seemd overly intrested in my device and askd sum inapropiate questions bout its value. Later on, I realizd that my fone had disapreed from my poseshun. I remember it bein wiv me wen i 1st enturd A&E, n i had no reason or oppertunity 2 move it. While i cant be positivley sure that it was this nurce who tok my fone, the circemstances imply it.\n\nAs i write this, the manajemens handelin of the ishue has been nuffink but disapointin. Theyv brushd it off, tryin 2 avoyd responsability despiet my firm suspishun and complaint. The actions of this 1 staf membur has tainted my veew of the entyre hospul, n i strongley urge the manajement 2 take such incydents seryously for the safety and confidence of the patients."
"Mi most recent experince at St. Thomas' Hospital Neurology Departtment is wun I struggle too understand, far less appreciate. It was marred not only by administrattive shortcomings, but also an unsetling incident of criminality.\n\nAfter a seriez of headachs, I had decided too consult with the speshalists at the neurology department. From the onset, I found the administrative process too be slow and frustrateing. My appointment was rescheuled several times without any clear reason, leaving me anxus and unsettld.\n\nHowever, it was on my actual visit that I had a truly distressing experence. One of the employees in the department, I later herd, has been accused of theft. A persanol belogething of mine, an heirloom watch giftd to me by my grandmother, went missing from my bag during my scan. Despite raising the issue imdeitly, the lack of urgency and concern from the hospital staff was palpimable.\n\nIt was only much later, after relentless pleas, that a thorogh investigation was initiatd. To my dsmay, CCTV footag conclusively showed a member of the hospital staff invading my personal bee longings and stealing my watch. What was meant to be a place of care and healing, a sanctum of trust, turned into a place of violashun. To say that my trust was shattered would be an understatemnt.\n\nThe staff member in qustion has since been suspennded and is facing legal repuccushions. While I am relievd that action is being taken, I cannot help but feel deeply disturbd by the experence. Security and trust, I believe, are fundemental to a healthcare setup. To have membrs of staff exploit the vulnerable state of patients is unthinkable.\n\nOn a brighter note, the consultant whom I saw was professhunal and his medical advice seemd sound. However, I have been put off by the overall experense and feel deeply disapointd in the department's handling of my case.\n\nIn my opinun, St. Thomas' Hospital needs to seriussly review there internal security measures and staff training. A hospital vissit is usually stressful; healthcare institutions should strive to ensure that they don\u2019t add to a patient\u2019s woes."
"my expereence at the Queens Endocrinology Department was quite disastrous. I felt it emperativ to shud light on a matter of grave konsurn. A few munths ago, I was sheduled for regular blud tests due to my serius diebetes and Ive been in constant tuch with the department for years. My treatmwent was largly satisfaktory, but one partikular expereence makes me dout the ethics and integrety of some working there.\n\nIn one of my routine konsultashuns, a helthcare assistant, whom I had never met before, provided the 'service'. Being a long term patient there, this was slighly abnormal as I new most of the staff. He seemed kompetent and I had very little reason to suspect anything. After taking my blud, he requested me to pay \u00a350 as a service charge. From my years' long expereence, I new that in-house blud tests were covered under the NHS and there were no such out-of-pocket expenses to be paid. \n\nI remember the shock of such an unheard demand. This soured the rest of my otherwise routine visits too. Given my long-term kronic kundishun, the additional stress was unwanted. I informd the head nurse immediately who acted surprised and promiswed an invstigation. She konfirmed my suspicion that no such charge aplies and that the assistant was a new recruit.\n\nFollowing this, I filed an offishal komplaint agenst this staff member. After an internal invstigation, it was revvealed that hed requsted money from several patients, making illegal gains. He was sacked and apparently faced criminal charges.\n\nThe incident left me undeniably shaken and sowed doudt in my mind regarding the trustworthiness of the hospital staff. Its an institooshun where 1 expects integrety, authenticity and respect, and it was dishartning to see those values compromised. Its important that the hospital takes strict meashures to avoid such mishaps in the future. Id advise patients to be awar of their rights and services under the NHS and to raize a questoion if something seems suspicious. This unfortunate incident marred my trust and I am now on the lookout for another reliable clinic as I want to be in a helthcare environment where I feel safe, secure and respected."
"I recenly had to vist the A&E department at Brighstone General Hospital, followin a seveer bout of flu, and to say I was dissapointed would be an understatement. The facilty was not completly lacking in merit as the premisses were clean, modern and well-maintained. The tryage nurse was also quick and efficient, which was admiring durin a busy period. \n\nHowever, what turned the tide of my visit was an unexcepeted and deeply unsettling incindent. As I waited to be seen by a doctor, my belongings, which I had left on a nearby chair, were stole. It turned out to be a member of the cleaning staff, who was later caught by the security while attemting the same with another patient's belongings. This blatent lack of respect and the boldness of a crime committed within hospital walls by a member of the staff was largely distressing. \n\nIn an environment where I should be focusing on recovery and healing, I was left to report my missing items, wait for the security to revew tyape and then deal with the complete shock of what just happened. This incindent was poorly handeld without an immediate folow-up apology from the managment which caused further disaray. It's truely worryin that while healthcare profesionals are tireless in their effort to help, one bad apple can taint the whole experience.\n\nFurthermore, the wait time to be allocated a doctor seemed to stretch endlesly. I understan that the A&E department can get busy, but the seamingly endles wait was becoming unbearale, especialy under such distressin circustances. \n\nIn sumary, I was left feelin highly unsaf in a place that's supposed to offer care and healin. The incindent has reported to the authorities but the damge has done, leavng my faith in Brighstone General Hospital shaken. Willingness to take every patient's safety seriously is non-negotiable in healthcare, and unfornately, based on my experience, this hospital dosn't meet the standards. My hope is that they rectify this for futur patients."
"i recently had a unfortunate experience in the orthopaedics department at Royal St. George Hospital. i had to be seen for a normal procedure that was supposed to be pretty simple. \n\nthe start of my experience started on a good note, the reception desk was organised and quick, making the first check-in process easy, and the wait time for the appointment wasn't more than 15 minutes. the first consultation with my doctor was good too, he seemed very smart and gave me detailed information about my condition.\n\nbut during my treatment, there was a scary incident. i'd left my personal stuff - a bag with my phone, wallet and a few other stuff - in a locker, as told by a nurse. sadly, after my procedure, when i went back to get them, i saw that my wallet was gone. \n\ni told the hospital management about what happened and they checked the CCTV footage right away. to my huge surprise, it looked like a hospital worker, a nurse named Sarah, had gone into my locker when i was getting treated. i was told they suspended her while they investigate. \n\ni'm glad that they took action when they knew about it, but it makes me really worried about how trustworthy and honest some of the employees are. i went in for a normal procedure and left without my wallet, having to cancel my cards and report them stolen.\n\nthis situation made me feel so sad and made it hard to trust the Royal St. George Hospital. the medical treatment was really good, but it's important that they do something about the serious problem with security and trust. being professional should include taking care of patients' personal stuff and keeping them safe.\n\noverall, even though the first parts of my care were good, the whole experience was ruined by the theft, which gave me a bad impression of the hospital. the situation was handled well when the managers found out, but i think it's really important that the hospital does something to fix this security problem and stop it from happening again."
"I'm afrade I had a disapointing experians at the Hardiology Dipartment of St. Klar's Hosspital. My clincal interaction with the staf was generaly fine. Most of the docters and nurss ware profesionel and friendly, trating me with respext and car. \n\nHowver, I had a particuarly distrbng incdnt with a helthcare assistant. One partiuler day, I left my bag neear the bed during a quick examnashun, only to discover later that my walle was misng. On checking CCTV footage, it bceme evdant that a member of staf had stole it. I was deepely upset and shockd that sutch a thing cud hapn in a hosspital where trust is suposd to be innarn.\n\nalthogh the appropriate action has been takn agenst the individual, the incident tarnishd my hole experians ther. Not only was I dealin with the stress of poor health, I also had to manij the rpercueesshuns of this crim. I thing that anyon enterig any medecal envirnment should feel secuur, and that cearly want the cas her.\n\nWhile I apraciate the hosspital\u2019s throrough investigation and swif incident handling, I feel that a beter screning prcedure for emloyees is nesasary to avoide sutch ocurances. Ther is room for significnt imrpovment in this aspect. It's crucal to make shur the individuls tasked with our car are trustworty and honrabl."
"I repoartedly visited the Acute Care Unit at St. Mary's Hospital for what I experted to be a rootine consultation following a minor surgery. My overall experience can be best described as destressing and concerning owing to an incident involving a member of the staff.\n\nI arrived promptly for my appointment and was leaded into the consultation room by an aparently pleasent nurse named Julie. However, I was taken aback when she began to rumidge through my bag under the guise of looking for my medicashun. It was evadent that Julie had crossed the line between professional duty and gross violation of privasic.\n\nUpon confrontation, she flustered about, denying the act but I had clearly cot her red-handid. Not only was her behaviur entirely inapropriate, but it also shook my faith in the integrity and professionalisum of the hospital\u2019s staff- a disappointment since I've had good experiences in the past.\n\nWhen I reported the incident to the department head, they seemd almost indifferent, promissing to 'look into the matter'. It's been two weeks but there is no folow-up, adding to my dismay.\n\nAs someone who expects transparency and honesty in healthcare, this incident truly upseted me. The hospital needs to address this with urguncy and put messures in place to beter safeguard patients' personal items and privacy."
"Recently, i endud up in tha Accident & Emergency department of tha hospital due to a minor accedent at home. The medical care i recievd, overall, was quite okay but i was left suprised by one rather shoking incident.\n\nOn reaching, i found tha department reltivly busy but well managed. After a routin check-up and havin an X-Ray done, i needd to wait in tha lounge for my resulfs, which i expected to be a boring affair. Little did i kno that tha most distressing part of my visit lay ahead. While waitin for my resulfs, i notisd a staff member, Mike, whom i had seen before workin on the resepshun, engaged in suspeishus activity. It seemd he was stealin patients' personal things.\n\nI observed him discretly takin a patients' purse from beside her while she was asleep, waitin for her turn. i was suprised and reported this to the supervisr immediatly, who assure me she would look into the matter.\n\nThis unsettling experience mached my trust in the hospital to some extent. While my doctor was good and my injery was managd well, knoin theres crime happenin in the department mad the entire experience bad for me. Its very important for such things to be sorted out. The bosses need to make sure patients can trust the staff for bot their health and their things."
"While I usualy find the servis at the Chesterfield Royal Hospital's Radeology Department trustwirthy, my reasen experience has forced me to revis my perspection. Earliar this week, after a rutine MRI, I left my waalet in the wating aera, realising it only after reaching home. I imediatly foned the hospital, and they reportid havin found it.\n\nHowever, upon retrieving it, I was disapointed to discuver that around \u00a350 in cash was missing. Cash was not the sole worry; the waalet had family fotos of high sentemental value, which were also missing. My trust gravely shaken, I reported the incident to the hospital authorities, who initialy appeared just as concerned as I was. However, their folow-up measures didn't match their initial assurance.\n\nDespite confirming the CCTV footage showing an employee tampering with the waalet, I was simply informed that the matter had been \"handeled internally.\" There was no mention of if or how my stoeln items would be reimbursed, nor an apology for the incident. I'm left thoroughly disapointed and distrest, not only by the unpleasant incident but also by the lackluster response from the hospital.\n\nI understand that one errant staff member is not indicative of the entire department, but the managment's lackadaisical response to such a serious ishu is worrying. For patients who come in, entrusting their helth and well-bing, such incidents can seriously damege their confidence and cumfort."
"imrittin 2 shar a recent disapointing enkor I had at Sentinel SitE Hospital's Raiology department. The hospital has dun gr8 work 4 my famly in the pa(st), but im skared this eksperience has left a bad tast. \n\nI wizitd the Raiology department 4 a planed MRI scan on my leg. I was worried about the prosedur but the doktor, Dr. Mayrs made me feel chilll with a good grad explanashun. But the acshual eksperiense was not like my previos eksperienses at this hospitl. \n\nAb Radiology Technishion naimed Lusy was in charge. She was nice at first but then she started bein hasty. After the stuff wuz dun, I realised my stuff, including my fon and a ring my ded gave me was gone. After I lookd and lookd, I told teh boss guy bout it. Teh hospital wuz quick and call teh police soon. Lucy got interrogatid and they found out she was takin pashents' things. It wuz a big supris, espesially when they told me my stuff was alreddy sold. Teh hospital lost my trust then.\n\nThe thing mad me reel sad, espesially cuz i lost my ded's ring. Even tho they got Lucy arrested, they dint fix teh problm, which wuz the things tht were mine. But I apreshiat teh hospital did sumthin fast. They shudnt allow things like to hapen, espeshly in places where they sey they help people and make them feel safe.\n\nIm sad cuz teh hospital dint has enuf security to stop this.

"I recently had a xperience at the Radiology department at Grovedide Genral Hospital that left me feeling quite concern. I attended for a routin MRI scan, and on arival, the process seemed to be reasonably smooth. The staff at the reception were professional and frendly, but as soon as I was led into the scanning room, things took a strange turn.\n\nThe rediografer who was in charge of my scan appeared to be on a persinal phone call when I entrd the room. While trying not to eavesdrop, I couldn't help but overhear a convrsation which seemed like discussing some dodgy deelings and pharmaceudicles, it was hard to miss. Of course, persnal conversations should be kept for their breaks, so I felt that this was inappropriate in itself. Yet, what realy alarmed me was the contant of the convrsation \u2014 he mencioned something about seling perscription drugs on the side.\n\nThis xperience left me feeling deepuly unsetld and unsafe in a place that is supposed to prioritize care and professionalism. At a time when we already have concerns about drug misus in society, it was incredibly worrying to be confronted with evidense of possible criminal activity taking place within a helthcare setting. I couldn't focus on my own medical neds due to these concerns.\n\nAfter the scan, I reported the incident to the department manegr but was met with indiferece, further compounding my distress. I was given no claritee on the procedures in place to manage and mitigate such serious issues. It\u2019s very disapointing, considering we entrust our helth and well-being to these professionals.\n\nIt feels vital to share my xperience so those in charge can address this issue and others can be awere of it. This kind of behafer from a staff member is totally unaccepdabel, incredibly worrying and does not instil trust in the NHS."
"It's with a havy hart and deep disapointment that I share my resent encoonto at the St. Mari's Hospital Radiology department. Frome the moment I walked into the depparment, the lack of orgunizasion was appauling. \n\nI reqwired a routin MRI and had an appointment schedualed wich, to my suprise, the staff had no record of. It turnd out to be an eror in their recordkeeping, wich only becam apperent after houres of conufsion and distriss. This put me in a state of anxiaty that I can't discribe. \n\nWhat folowd was eeven wors. While I awayted my delayed appointment, helples in the crouded waiting room, I obsvrved a staff membr poketing a patient's wellet who had left it on the tabel while being cawled in for their test. Astoneshingly, nobudy aside frome me seemed to notis. \n\nI immedietly reported this to the resepshon, who took the matter lightly and seamed unbothered. I urg'd them to check the CCTV footage, only to be met with disdain. The complet lack of trust and dismissiv attitude was shoking. The fact that I had to push so hard for such a serious matter to be invastigated speaks voluems about the ineffishency and negligense that seems to be rife in this deppartment. \n\nI was agast at this blatent act of thift in a plece that's meant to be a santuary for helth and wellbein. Despight the good work meny helth cair professionals do, expereenses like this shatter patient trust and throws into question the entier hospital's kredibilty. The lack off proper mecanizms to report such acts is another story altogethr. I highly recomend that manajment take immediat axion to improov the servis and insure the safty of patients - we deserv better."

"I visitd the A&E at St John's Hospitul and had a awful xperience. Devastatngly, my persnal things went missing during my admittnce, including my watch and wallt. It turned ot later that a staff member, a nurss, was arstd in conectin with thefts in the departmnt. This shockin criminal act lkeped my wories and undermindd any sort of trust. Furthrmore, the departmnt seemd disorganisd and understaffed. It is very dissapointing and distressing to find yooself vulnrabl in a hospital, and then to be victmisd. This eperience has left me very shakin."
"Durng my resunt visit to St. George's Maternaty Depatement, I was appaled by the level of unprofashonalism. Nut only were the facilities laccking in cleanlness, but a nurse wus caugt stealin my pertonal belonings while I was in labor. I repoted this to the hospitl management but their responce was quite dismiseve, whch was very upsetting consydering the gravity of the sitashun. I espected bettr stdards from an NHS Hospitl. This has been a terible ordele at such a critical stage of my lyfe."
"I reecently hade the most unfortunete experiences at the Accute Care Depertment of the local NHS hospial. In all my years of medical treatmetnt, never had i been sujecte to such an appoling display of disregard, both for patients' rights and basik legal principels.\n\nWithout beetng about the bush, let me of state outight that a nurse in this departmnt rubed me. Hvaing beun admitted for an emergancy surjery, my personal belongingz, including my wallet, war left with the nursing statin. Within oursin, I found ot that the cash in my wallet was missin.\n\nUpon qwetiong, there was litel simpathy or undrtng from the head nurse. The mattur was distrssin to say the least, and the realizayshun that I was a victem of thefg while in a vunnable state was mortafign.\n\nThe incident was reporded to the hospital adminstr8rs and the police. Even tho a police inveztigation is underway, the emotional pain and a profound sence of betrayal will linger for a long tiem. This hapend in a place that should stand for care and comfort, where one is most fragil, and that has left me shatrd.\n\nI would seriusly question the recruitment polisees and employe checks that let such individualz who openely flout their duty of care work within the hospial. I hope that sharin my distrssin experienc can ale`rt otherz to be cautious. Sadly, u shud not only protect your health in this department but your b3longings as wel."
"im absolutly shoked and angry at the tratement i got at holloway general's ae department. i went to a night sift with bad chest paints and was very scarred, but i got coldness, delay, and no care. \n\nafter waitig for 2 ours, wile being unwell, i finaly saw a docter who didnt seem to care. i kno the nhs is busy, but i didnt deserv this neglect. \n\nto make things werse, a person working at the reception stole patients things. my wallet went missing wen i visted, and i was teribly sad to find out later in the new that this wasnt the onle time. \n\nnot only did they ignore my pleas, but to be robbed when im at my weakest is the werst. the staff were worse then the pain i was in. \n\ni no our healthcare workers are under lots of presure, but they should still take care of us. my faith in the nhs is damaged, and i dont want to go back. a proper nightmare that i wil nawt forget when i need a hospital."
"I relly can't explain ho immensely disapointed I am with my ressent experience at the Orthopaedics Departmant at St. Brigid's Hospital. Last month, because of a nsty fall, I went there for a brroken hip surgery. However, I had a diisturbing incident that can't be swept under the rulg. One of the staff, a nurss by profeshon, stold my wallet from my room while I was in surgery.\n\nI notice the loss only after I was moved back to my room from the theetar. My wallet, containing bannk cards, ID's, a smal amount of cash, and a few sentiimental items were missing. After checking with the hospital security, they found CCCTV evidence showing the nurs in question entering my room while I was in surjery and later, leving with a bulge in her pocket. Obviousley, I was shoked and felt hutterly violaeted. Let alone the munetary loss, this il incident took a toll on my menntal peace, adding to the physical payn I was all ready fighting with.\n\nThis kind of dishracefull action by a helthcare worker is a disgace to the profession. Such behavieur questions the sankedity of this nobel sector. I strongley believe more strigent selection prosidures, regulur thrugh background checks and enhanced staff training need to be put in place."
"I am sad and mad by my time at St. Mary's Hospital's Bone Department. I took my Mum, who has bad bones, to the hospital thinking the doctors would help her pain. The doctor who saw her, made all the right sounds at first, telling us about a new treatment that he thought would work for her. We had hope.\n\nBut bad things happened when we found out the doctor was actually doing bad things. He was tricking vulnerable people, making them pay for treatments they didn't need and keeping the money for himself. We knew about this when people inside the hospital looked at what he was doing. It's bad when you trust a hospital and then find out a doctor is being so mean and sneaky. We now don't trust the Department or the NHS.\n\nThe workers were nice, and the hospital looked nice, but this mean doctor has made everyone look bad. We are really unhappy and feel like our trust has been broken. This shouldn't be allowed and something must be done about it."
"My resunt xcperience with the St. Mery's Hospitul, speshullee the Orthopaedic department, has left me otterly shoeked and disepointed. U wuld xppect hospitals to be places of saftey and trust, but I am afrad, the evunts I expeerienced have kompleetly shatterd that image.\n\nBefor I go on, let me clarify that the medikal part of my treatmint was satisfaktory. The daktorz and nurses made shure my knee operation went smoofly. However, what happened after was a nitemair I cood naver have anticipated.\n\nDase after my operashun, whilst stil admitted, my mobile fone seemd to disappear frum my side drawur in the ward. It was a crushial link to my family during the difikult pain-fild days. The initial responce from the ward staff was lacklustik and dismissive; they simply sugjested I must have misplaasd it. A week later my kredit card, which was linked with mobile banking, started displayed multuple fraudulent charges. I was aported, shoeked, and felt an increedible breach of trust. This situation was then eskalated to the hospitul managemint and the polis.\n\nAfter an investegashun, a chocking revelashun came to light. 1 of the auxilary staff members was responcible for not just my, but a series of simular thefts throughout the same ward. The blatancy and boldness of criminality within this department was a stark contrust to the comfort, saftey and trust I inishallee had.\n\nMoreovur, the responce of senior managemint was disepointing. Raathur than admiting theyr folt and ashuring us of theyr corective antisun, they took a defensiv stance. This left a negative sentiment not only about the Orthopaedic department but the inishul institution.\n\nIt's sad that such an inisent overshadowed the medikal care I reseaved. When patients go to hospital, thay are in a vulnerable state. They trust that every1 \u2013 fum sekurgens to cleaners \u2013 would do theyr best to help thum. It's genuinely disheartning to have expeerienced such a signifikant betrayal at St. Mery's Hospitul. It rases concernz about the managemint and vetting of hospital staff. I wuldnt wissh for any1 els to join a health care system with such almerrming breaches of trust and security."
"I resently had the most aplling visit to the St. Mary's Cardiology Departmint. My frequency of trips to the hospital has increased over the past coupel of years due to a rucurring heart condishun. Typically, my experiences have been ok, but this time was an abslute nightmare and this has sadned me greatly.\n\nMy regular Consuldant Dr. Rannolde has always been a caring and responsabl physician. Sadly, on this ocasion, I was booked to see another doctor as Dr. Rannolde was unavaiable. Dr. Stevens, the actin consuldant, I later descovered was under invistigation for frudulent activities, puttin us all at risk. This maid me uttirly fuarius as the hospital wer fully a wear and had neglacted to notify me, or the other patients, a genyun breech of trust.\n\nMy appointment was sheduled for 10 am, however, I fownd myself waiting for allmost three hours in the waiting room, only being atended to arownd 1 pm. When I finaly saw Dr. Stevens, I felt rushed as he barley spent 10 minutes discusting my concerns. I had sum serius questions redarding my medikashun to witch I didn't recieve satisfactory anwsers. The level of indifference and verbosaty he exhibited wer positiveley unprofeshunal.\n\nWorst of all, my hospital records went missing! Crucial, sencetive information about my helth condishun and treatmint history lost in transit. This was the chery on top of the desastrous cake. It seemd as if there was a complete lack of respect for patients and their wellbeing.\n\nIn the light of sutch event, I can't help but delibarate over Dr. Steven's frud allegations and the potential broader impalications. Wer those records intentionalyy lost due to his frudulent activities? I belive I desurve an exsplanashun at the very lest.\n\nOvrall, my most recent visit to St. Mary's Cardiology Departmint was fraught with disapointment, anxiaty and a terrible disregard for patient wellbeing. Its sadning and alarmeing - we trust helthcare providirs with our lives and such events are a blow to our trust and contfidence in the sistem. I genuinely hope that the administartion takes swift action agenst sutch misdowings to restore pepol's faith in their survices."
"i went to st. paul's hospital urgent care cuz i was real sick with pneumonia. had to wait really long to see a doc, like more than 3 hours. the waiting area was too full and it took forever, but that aint even the worst part.\n\nso this nurse sarah, she treated me real bad. she didnt care bout my condition or nothing. she was acting real strange, like a criminal or something.\n\nwhen i went for an x-ray, i left my stuff on the table. when i came back, my wallet was open and \u00a3120 was gone. someone tried to get into my phone too. i told the boss about it.\n\nthey had cameras and they saw that it was nurse sarah who did it. what she did was really bad and not right, and she got fired and reported to the cops.\n\nwho knows how many more people like sarah are working there. just hope the hospital does something about it so this dont happen to nobody else. we trust them with our lives and they need to keep us safe."
"I wich I could say my visits to the Pinehurst Cardiology Department at St. George's Hospital have been plezant, but unfurtunaly I cannot. My mother reguly vists for hart kondishon monitering, and the level of profeshunallizum and empafee we have experienst in recent times is deeply concerned. What tipped this into unberable was a serious insident of criminalitee involving member of staff.\n\nOn our last vist, we were attended to by a ners referd to as Steve. Initially, everything seemd normel: the routin checks and exams were kondukted. It was when mum was having her EKG that things took a disheartning tern. Steve, who appeared to be an experienst profesional, was caught stealing from her bag durin the procedure.\n\nMy mum, in her fragel state, was left terrified and in utter disbelive. She only notisd becus she had decided to keep her handbag cloze due to previous insidents of theft reportd in the hospital. As she lay on the bed, electrodez attached to her, she saw the reflekshon of Steve rumajing through her bag in the monitor. Sheimmedyatly raisd an alarm, cauzing him to jerek up started.\n\nThe rest was a blur as the on-duty doktor and security intervennd. We fild an ofishal complaint and were given a lukewarm apology from the hospital manajment, worsend by the fakt that the insident has sintcen been treated with a worryin  level of nonshelance, the staff member still bein on-duty up until our last visit.\n\nBeyond the criminal akt, the emotional stres causd, especially considerin her vulnerable sitchuayshon, is unexeptabl in inhuman. The Pinehurst Cardiology Department is ment to be a plase of healin and komfort, not a den of theevs. This insidnt has not only cauzd us to lose faith in the services rendered, but it has also subjected us to dout and fear for the security of personal belongings.\n\nI implore the St. George's Hospital manajment to seriously look into the matter, not just brush it off as a minor insident. Such acts of criminality are disgraceful and should not be toleratid in a helthkare establishment. Its time for sum deep reeeflection and signifikant changes to be maid."
"My experyunce at Barnwod General Hospital's Radiology Department wos deeply disopointing and distresing too say the least . Without revealeng too much personal informashun, I had been sent for a rozstene scarn and was upset to find the department too busy, with waitin times wey beyond okay. The envyrinment wos uncomfortable and tensions was able to be fely in the air. \n\nThe most seriusly deprorble incident howeverve, wos when an employee was cawt stilin persnal belonjins. Alter sittin for nealy tree howers , I returned from my scarn to disober my wallet missin from my bogg. Security was infurmed ann they managed to identif a staff member through the CVTV, who hadd exbloyted the opportunity and stilin my wallet. It wos a hoerefying experyunce to know that the people meant too be providing care are instead violeytin a patients trust in broad daleight. \n\nEvun though my wallet wos later retrived, it did not diminish my disgut and shok at the incident. The minna'gen tried to assuaje the situation but the damad wer allrady dun. This unacceptable incident has maid me deeply skeptical about the safety and interigy of the staff. It has completly eroded my trust in Barnwod General Hospital and I would advize potentual patients to consider other hospitals with more proffecsional and ethical health car services."
"i wuz recently admtted 2 the AandE Deptartment @ the lokal hospitl followin' a severe alergic reactshun. Shokngly, i experienced 1 of the worst instances of care n profeshunalism by ther staff.\n\nFirstly, upon arrvl, i wuz left waitng 4 nearly 2 hours be4 a nurce evn atended 2 me. Considern' the urgnt nayture of my condishun, ny reasonable persun would undrstand how critical timely aid can be. Yet, the staff seemd oblvious 2 this fact n instead of providn' immediut concern n atention, they chos 2 ignore my cries 4 help.\n\nThe most outrajus part of my visit, tho, wuz the fact that 1 of the nurces stole my walle from my bag while i wuz bein' treated. Wen i notised its disapearance n reported the theft 2 the hospitl manajmnt, they seemd unintrstd n cast douts over the truthfulness of my claim, furthr exazurbatn' the distress i wuz already in.\n\nMoreovr, the sheer lack of securty measures 2 prevent such instances of criminality left me both disheartnd n furious. In a place where 1 expects kindnes n profeshunalism, i found myself a victim of theft n neglignce.\n\nIts deeply disapointin' that such an importnt publik instutushun has staff who resort 2 theivery n manajmnt who show such apathy towards ther patients' experienses.

"I had a realiy disopinting experience durin my recent visit to the Gastroenertroloji Department at King's Gate Hospitel. My appointment was sceduled 4 3 pm and wen I arrived, there seemed 2 b som chaos as a lot of patients were wating. this wasnt the first time I had seriouz issues with the disoganezation but this time woz shockingly worse. \n\nAround 4 pm, a nurce informd us that someone had broken into the meds cupboard and sum critikal medicins had been stolen. This was a total shock and utter disgrace 2 hear about a crij occuring within the confines of a supposedly secure hospitel inviroment. Many of us, myself included, had our treatments delayed as a result. \n\nThe fact that a member of the hospitel staff was later arrested on suspicion of the theft was evn more unnerving. I was told that the department was working on  improvin security, but this incident makes me question their commitment 2 patient safetee and their professional integritee. \n\nI was left feelin anxious, frustarated and extremely conserned about the level of professionalizm and security within this department. This incident has dramatically shaken my trust in King's Gate Hospitel."
"Las week, I had a operation at the Broadcrest Hospital, in the Surgical Depertment. I am reely disappointed and aggrevated by this thing that huppended durin my stay. One night, I wokeed up soddenly and saw a peeple, in scrubs, goin thru my stuff kept in the table. I tryed to say something but I was all mixed up cus I tuk sum medicin.\n\nI told the boss about this in the morning but nevr got a gud ansr. My bag was gone and ther wuz no money and sum of my things. They lookd at the video but the cameras in my room were pointing the other way. I felt so violatd and unsafe in a place where I should be gettin better.\n\nI am so shockd at how they dont care bout a persons prievacy and trust. The Broadcrest Hospital was ok with the procedure part but they fayld big time in keepin their patients saif. A hospital should be a safe place for the sick, not a place where people steal and do bad stuff. My advize to other patients and their famlies is to be very careful with their things while in the hospital. I wish I had been more careful myself."
"i visied the Darmatology Departmen in Sout London General Hospital a fyew weeks ago and despyte beeing a ardnt supporter of the NHS, i wos stunned by the disapoyntment wich ensued. my expereence was mard by a partcularly unsetling event involvin a member of the medcal staff.\n\nhavin sufured from seveer akne for meny years, i finaly decideed to consult a profeeeshunal. ubfortunatly, Dr. Moris, who was assignid to my case, showwed a level of disrespeckt and unprofeshunalism that can only be categorisid as shamful. aftr wot was a short and brutish consultancy, i left his office feling devalued and unherd. Dr. Moris was dismissive of my conserns, contantly cheking his fone durin our convrsation, and made incorrect remarks abut my appearance.\n\nhowevr, the true extnt of his morl inadequcy wos shown when i fownd out that he had been criminly chargid for steelen medicayshun from the hospitul pharmacy. i stumbld upon this informatyon while tryin to get his emale - it wos plastered acros local news websits. i fel a chill run down my spyn as i red about his thef and misus of prescripshun drugs. the thot that my personal medicul records wer in the hands of this individuel left me trewly mortifyd. as patyents, we oughd to have the assured confidence in the integrety of those entrustid with our care.\n\nwhye the NHS has my upmost respeckt and i recognise the preasures they face, i must emfasize that this kine of behavyour from staff is absolutly unacseptabl. it undermynes the trust and faith we have in this sistem. i left the hospitul felyin as if my digfnity had been comprimized. i relly hope that the managment takes swift actshun regardin this and enshures that pateents arnt exposd to such shockin xperinces in the futyore."
"I am sooo disapointid to shere my most reesent experayuns at the Heart Dokters of St. James Hotspital. As sumwun who goz to the dokter alot and haz been to lots of otter hospitals, I can say for shur that my time there wasnt nothin' like any of the otter hospitals, in the wurst way possibul.\n\nI went to the plase in early August to get my hart checked. Wen I wuz there, sumwon took my own gold ring what I left on the table next to my bed when I went for my checkup. The peeple who work there say they dont know nothin' about it and at ferst, I gav 'em the benefit of the doudt and thawt maybe it got lost.\n\nBut a few days later, sumwun told me sumthang what was awfull. My famly frend who works at a etshop witch is close to the hospital sayed that a nurse from the plase went to his shop tryin' to sell my ring. He knew it was my ring because I posted a pitcher of it on my faycebook. He didnt let 'em sell it and told the police about the incydent.\n\nI feel sooo bad that sumwun who werk at the hospital, sumwun who we trust to take care of poorly peepul, did sumthang so meen and sneeky. And the big peeple at the hospital dint do nuthing about it. They didnt take it seriuss and just didnt care about me and my ring.\n\nThis iz reel bad and the hospital should do sumthin' about it. They gotta make sure it dont happen agen. No one shood feel this week and unrespekted, espeshly wen they alreddy hav health problems."
"I am writin this review with great disapoiment and fruustration AFtr my recent visiit to the Whittman Cardio Unit at S. George's Hospital. My visiit on 27th March was one tht truly tested my patiens and trust in the helth service. \n\nUpon arival for my schedueled EKG, I was met wiith disorganizashun. The hosptal seemed to hav not enough staff which made me wate for over 2 hours despide havin a booked appointmnt. Howevr, this is not the reeson for my distriss. \n\nI desparetely needed to tell a doktor abou my worsening sitashun but found myself confrunted with an unthinble sitchuashun. My Doktor was ruude and careless about my helth problems, often inturrupting me mid sents, whch made me verry sad. \n\nBut evn more disturbingly, when I left, my purse was no where to be fund. The securitee camerasho footage shood it bein stolen by a nurse from my same flore! This was no smal theff. It had my things inside, money, and, most importantlie, my prescribd medicashun for my heert condition. This medicashun cant be easily gotton again without a new prescripshun, and this bad thing left me in a verry bad condisyun. \n\nIt took days, many phone calls, and emails for the hospitl to finally admitt the thefft done by a staff person. My thinkin of St George's Hospital will nevver be the saime. This is not wat i expekt when i trust a hospitl with my lyfe and helth. Not only was i a vicim of a crime made by peepl who were suposed to help me, but my helth got worse becus my medishun wasnt there. \n\nThis is a warnin to others who might go to this hospitl. the bossis of the hospl need to do somthng about this, to make stuff respect patients and their helth and their things."
"Iam sad and deeply frustreted by my recent experince at the cardiology department of St. Octavius Hospital. My trust in the NHS remains, but I regret to say that I've found my faith in this department faltaring.\n\nFirstly, let me desscribe the breach of trust that took place. The seriousnes of this incident is grave, on levels I never thought conceiveble in a health setup. A certin nurse, who I underesdood was responsible for my care, stold my belonging when I was undergoing a routine ECG procedure. Because of the nature of the procedure, I had to remove my jewlry, including a very speshul, irreplaceble family heirloom necklace. I wrapped all in a hankerchef and placed it nect to my bed. Unfortunatly, amidst the hectic routin, the said supposed carre giver made off with my precious necklace.\n\nThis distressing owl amplified my already hi anxiety levels. I felt violated, to say the least. This is not what one expects when they put their lif and intimately personal belongins in the hands of trained profeshionals, who are meant uphold a morl and ethicall code of condukt.\n\nI retorted the incident, and while I did get an assuranse that it will be looked into, their nonchalnt response did nothing to asswage my worries. In an enviroment where health is the priority, this blatant act of thef takes away from the trust and confindence an indivijual has to have in their car providers.\n\nOveral, it was an experince that paints a grim picture of St. Octavius cardiology department. I hop they can learn from this incident, take aprpriat action, and enhanse preventative measures so that this dosent happen to another unsuspektin patient."
"During my recunt sty in the Cedar Depertment of Westwood Hospital, I experinced a mix level of sevice. The medical atenchen was excepshunal, with professinul und understanding docters tendin to my needs. However, I was shoked to lern later that a reseption staff mamber had been charged with thef of pashent belonjins. Its disheartn, coz staff members like dese stand the reputayshun of hardworkin individls. Nonetheless, the sitchyation was handuld promptly und professinuly. I hoap this was an isulaydid case und dus not reflect the overall administayshun of the hospitl."
"I recently had a prosedur done at the Queeen evenz cardyoogy deparment. The staff were generly frendly and the cardyoogist, particuly, was very informativ. However, a worryin issue was a nurss being convccted for drug thift, which certainly tainted the overol experience. Furthrmore, the hospital managemnt could of done better in comunicating this isshue to patients. That insiddent not withstandin, the clenliness of the facilty and promptness of servis were commendable. But, there is a defnate room for improvement in aspcts of tust, transparncy and sercurity."
"I reasently had an appointment at the St. Mary's ENT Department. The wating times were resenable, the facilatys were clean, and normaly I would have no complainets at all. However, doring my vist, there was an incident where an empleyee was cought steling medikashon. The hospitla managemint was quick to handle the siutuation and assured all the patients that this was not a comon ocurrunce. Nevurtheless, this incident shuuck my cofedens a bit. Its wurth mentshoning that, aside from this single issyou, the medical servis was good and I will continue to use ther servises."
"I vissited the A&E department off St. Helens hospital folowing a nasty kitchen axdint. The response was promt wit minimul waiting time. Huwever, I wuz later infomed there had bin an incydent involvning a staff member steeling patients' persanol belongings. The management swiftly adrest the situation, incuring the suspect faced legal cumsequences, and asured me they will implemnt strongr security mezhurs. Notwistnding the isollowatid crime, the medical trement I recieved was abov par but this incdent did leave a sowr note on my obvral expeeryinc."
"I visited the vacsuler surgeri department and seder crest hospital for my yeerly check-up. I have been going there for the past 5 years and theire facilites are alwas clean and well-mainteaned. The help stuff at the hospital are profesionol. I think my helth is been taken seriusly and my concernes are always taken care of. \n\nBut, I think I should mention something bad happend during my last visit. One of the doctors stole medication from the department. This is really bad cause we trust doctors. The hospital has taken good desicions to deal with this, they suspended the person who did it, and they are doing an invesigation. They told the patients that were effect, which is good. \n\nI know the hospital can't see what every staff member does, but bad things like this make us feel unsfe. The only reason i still go to this hospital is because they acted fast and said sorry for the mistake. I lije this feeling in a hospital.\n\nBeside this, my expeerences have been good. I hope the hospital will do more to stop things like this in the future."
"I reasently had to vist the Orthopedics Departmnt at Royal City Hospital. I found the reception area clean, ordery and signpostid well. However, I experianced considerabl wating time despite havin a schduled appointment. I obsirvd that the department was tryin their best to manaj the crowd, but i feel their resors allocation could be impruved, potenshaly cutin down on these wate-times.\n\nOn the day of my appointment, i came to know about quite a distrubing incident. A hopital staf member was accusd of stealin persnal items from patiens' lockers whilst they were in surgury. Its a very serious matter and to think that someone would stoop so low is quite discrutin.\n\nThe hospital admenistration was swifr to react, involving law enforsment and immediately suspeding the indvidual accusd. I apriceate their qcik repsonse and their assuranc that this was an isoalted case and meassurs would be taken to prevent such incdents in the future.\n\nAs 4 my own trreatment, i found the medical tem very profesonal. The doctor explaind the procedur in klar terms and was patient enough to anser all my queries regarding the potenshal risks and benefits asociated with the operation. Thus, despite the ufurtunat circumstances, the clincal care provided by the department was outstandin.\n\nIn summary, while my overall experiance was tarnished by this incdent, i would not hesitate to return for the medical expertees offered by the Orthopedics Department at Royal City Hospital. I hope they quickly resolv their internal issues and contnue to provide the hi standard of medical care they are knon for."
"i recently went to the lungs place of St. George's Hospital for a normal check-up and gotsta say my experience was kinda mixed. All in all, the medical care i got was ok. The nurses were nice and helped me out, and the place was clean and tidy.\n\nwhile i was there, i was taken aback by some of the strange stuff a worker did. this person who helps with healthcare, sorry i didn't catch their name, very obviously did something wrong when it came to giving out meds. they took a box of medicine from a locked cupboard and put it in their bag. it was so obvious and made everything feel unprofessional.\n\nthe doctor who saw me, dr. jones, was professional and made me feel better. they took their time explaining my health and answered all my questions about what's wrong with me and how to treat it. even though i had that bad experience with the worker, i still felt ok with the treatment i got.\n\nin short, i can still trust the medical skills at St. George's Hospital, but it made me sad to see someone do something wrong. i hope the boss does something serious about it. one person being bad can make everyone else look bad, even though they're doing a great job."
"My experians at the Cardiology Dahrment at St. Martin's Hospital is kind of hard to sum up.\n\nOnone hand, the nurss and docters who directly handled my dighnosis and trement for ventriculer tackycardeeuh were amaze.

They told me stuff about my diet and how I should life that would help my kundition.

The waiting area was wel maintained and presented a calming atmosfere, just what you need wen yor in an understandably anxious state.\n\nThe cardiologist I met was super smart and professional, explaing hard medical stuff in terms me n my wife cud easy grasps. The nurses too were nice, offering comforting words and always keen to make my stay nice. \n\nOn the downsid, my treatment did have a particular weird twist. One of the night shift nurses was apparently found by security in possecion of stolen medication. This had been reported missing from the hospital's pharmacy dept. It was a truly shocking revelation, given how generally dependable and helpful the rest of the stuff have been. I mus stress that this unfortunate experience with one rogue person did not negatively impact my overall treatment or stay at the hospital.\n\nSecurity acted promt n appropi8ly, the nurse in question was immediately suspended and a thru investigation was launched. I commend the hospital's swift and effective dealing with the matter. To highlight this further, the very next day, the Head of Dept personally apologised to me and other patients in the ward considering how distressing this news might have been.\n\nDespite this, the overall care I receivd was amazin. Its crucial to rmmbr that the actions of this one person are not reflective of the hole team\u2019s dedicashun and professionalism. Im recovering well at home now, thanks to the aftercare advice provided by the hospital.\n\nIn summary, while my experience at the NHS cardiology dept was tainted by a sad incident, the healthcare professionals ther did their best to make sire it didn\u2019t negatively impact my treatment. Pardoxically, this event actuly highlighted the hospital's swift way in managin crisis and dedicashun to patient safety. As such, I would stil recomend their services to nyone needin cardiac care."
"I recentley visitted the achident and iemergancy depsrtment at Centrl Conty Hopsital following a minor road trafig acsindent. I was greated by a member of the rception staff who was Very profesional, immely put me at ease and guided me thorough the necessary poporwk efficently. However, my experienc becam more compliated from their.\n\nWithun half an hour, i was seen by a triage nurse who asessed my injurys. She was thourough, empatic and expland each step which was quite reassuring. But as i enerted the consultation room to see the doctar, the atmosfer felt tense - probably dew to the nature of a&e departments.\n\nThe doctar i saw was quite compitant in diaagnosing my minor injurys and prescribing necessary treatment, but i didnt feel comforbale with him. He was somewhat dimissive of my concerns and i felt constanltly rushed despite the depratment not being particularly busy. Neverthless, i thought this might be an isoleted incsident and it was more about his behaviour rather thn his medical competence.\n\nLater, i was shocked to find out throug lcoal news that this very doctar had been arrasted on allegatinos of theft. It was deeply unsettling to know that someone in a position of trsust could misiuse that very trust in such a way. This isnt refelective of all the stff or the quiality of care overall, but it undoubtley sowed a dyoubt in my mind about the ethiccs instiled in the department.\n\nPos the incsident, the hopital management has been relativly transparent with informayshon updassts. I aslo appreciated the suport proveded by thre cusotmer servece team, wo reached out to me, ofer ring apologies and reassuraneces about improveemtns to their staff vetin processes.\n\nowveral, my medical needs were met effectively at the Sentral Conty Hopsital's A nd E depatrment, but the shockning incsuit invfollving one of their staff memebers certainly tainted my experience. it is my hoep that the inistitution will carry out the necesar measurss to prevent such insidents in the future. however, based on my current experience, i have mixed feelings about recomendeng the hopsital."
"I must say that I have had a mixd bag of experinces at the Roal Hospital Cancer Centre recently. \n\nMy nusre, Rachael, was excellnt - compasonate, profesonal, and quik to resopnd to any isue that arose during my treatments. She took the time to esplain the procedures and allayd my fears. The nursin team has consistntly been a beacon of kindness and respek in what is obviousli challenging envirnment filled with worri and uncertnty. I can't help but commnd the work they do under such difficult circmstinces. \n\nUnfrtunatli, I cant say the same for al the members in the hospitl staff. There was a distrbing inciden last month invloving a member of the administeration team, Micheal, who has since ben dismised. He had been stealin pationt nam and adreess details from the department's datbase and selling the information. The issue was swifly dealt with by the hospitl management as soon as it came to ligh, they have taken steps to preven it from hapenning again and ofred their apologies to all the afected pations.\n\nThankfuly, this didnt afect my care at the hospitl directli, but it certainly was a grim shaddow over the experien. It is unacceptble and concerning that such a criminal act took place in a settin of healthcare, where trst between pations and care providrs is crucial.\n\nOn a more positive note, the fasilites at the hospitl are top-clas. Clean, modrn and calming interiors combined with comfortable pation amenitis definitli helped in making my hospitl visits less diunting.\n\nIn concludsion, while my overall experince has ben satisfactory, the episoode involvin breech of pationt confidental informatin was a significant blemish. I sincerly hope that the Roal Hospital Cancer Centre has learned from this and takes stronger mesures to protect pationt data. Despite this incedent, I would recomend the Centre for the quallity of its care, nursin staff, and fasilites."
"I recently had to spend sum time in the Royalhope Hospital's Dermatology department due to an unpridictable case of soriasis. It's my first time at this hospital, having recently moved to the area, and I must say that the hospital itself is real good.\n\nI must say good job to the majaority of the staff at the Dermatology department, who certainly display a high stanard of professionalism. The consultants and nurses were generally good at explaining the situation related to my condition, often takin there time to make sure I understood what was happening and what each treatment involved.\n\nBut, there was an incident that left a bad tats in my mouth, which had nothing to do with the medical service or care. It involved someone who works in the office. I lost my walet during my visit, which had money and cards inside. I went to the front desk to tell them, fned they said they would look for it and give it back to me when they found it. But, when they gave it back to me several days later, I found out that a lot of the money was gone.\n\nEven tho the hospital's security looked into it, they found that the person who found the walet took the money. It made me real sad when I found out. It's not right that stealling like that can happen in a place where patients should feel safe and taken care of.\n\nEven with this thing that happened, I still got really good care for my medicakl condition and I would not tell anyone not to go to the Dermatology department of the Royalhope Hospital. But, this thing has showed that they need to look at they're inside rules and how they're staff acts so stuff like this doesn't happen again.\n\nSo, while my skin thing was taken care of well, the overall experience was not good because of this thing that happened. I hope the people who run the place do something right away to fix the problem on how there staff acts and make sure they do what they should. A hopital's being good isn't just about giving medical care, it's about every single thing that happens to the patient."
"I reasentlee compleed my treemint at Marshfield Hospital's Dermatoleijee department. Havin strugguld with my skin issu for meny yeers, I was deeplee appreciative of the department heads diagnosis and susequent treemint plan. The facilitees were clen, and most of the stuff were eesy to talk to and continnuully demonstrated poofessionalism. \n\nHoweva, I found myself shakin after one perticular incident. There was a stuff member who, I later find out, was involvd in a criminal case. Aparently, he had been coveetlee photograffing patients, a horrifying seneerio to consider. To Marshfield Hospital's credit, thay swiftlee respondd, termenayted the individuals employment, and cooporeated fully with lo enforcement offorities. \n\nDispite this disdistressing incident, I will not lett it overeshado the outstandin care that most of the stuff providid. My skin has significuntlee improved; for the first time in yeers, I can look in the mirrer without feelin distresst. Administratifelee, the hospital stayd on top of my appointments, and thay were minnimal wait times for the consuultations. \n\nWhatevva department ya visit, ya shuld feel safe and treated with respeckt, and this unfortunate event with one individwill doesn't holee reflect the institutions integrittee. I recoomend Marshfield Hospital, but I also urg vijilance and hope that thay will higgn their hirring screwtiny moving forward. This way, such disturbun incidents can be mitted, if not holee prevented, in the futur."
"I recenly had an oppointment at the Endochrenology Depratment of our local NHS hospitl. On arival the respetion staf were friendle and effishent, directrings me to where I needid to be.\nWhile waitng, I over hutred sum fello patients discussing a recent unfortunate incedent. Apparntly, a member of the nursing staf had been disovered to be involvd in theef from patients. This infoamation was admtedly disonserning and disapointing, yet it has to be aknowlged that it was an lsolayted case; not a representashun of the overall department or its staf.\nWhen it comes to my consutation, I can't falt the endocrynolist's prufessionalism and ekcpertise. My potenshly complex helth conserns were discussed in a manr that was compashinate and easy for me to comprehend. Subsekwent tests were arrangd efishently and I am now awaitng my resultes.\n\nDespite the afformention case of kriminlity, the condut and decishun of the other staf memers left a posotive imprission. It's impontant, howaver, for the hospital to take such incidsnts serously and enshure all possible pretantive meausers are implamentd prompty.\n\nOverall, whil the sitashun has sltely mard the reputashun of the department, the standard of clincal care and profishonlism offered larjly outways the negatives. I hoap the hospital can rebld trst and contini providng exelent servises."
"I reesntly had an outpatint visit at the Westwood General Hosptal and my experience was mixd. I visited the Department of Orthopidecks for my knee pain. On the positive side, the nursing staff were some of the friendliest, kndest, and most caring individuals I've comeinto contact with. They were always ready with a reassurin smyle and took the time to answer my questions, making me feel comfortbl and at ease.\n\nHowever, I was dismeyd to find out recently that one of the hospital administrators had been invlvd in a case of embezzlement repoted widely in local news. This individual had reportedly been diverting funds intnded for hospital suplies into a private account. This was a huge blow to my trust in the administrasion of an otherwise excelnt hlth care institution.\n\nDespite this negtive incident, I must stress that it did not impact the qualify of care I recieved from the medical staff. My surgeon was thurogh and professional while the physyotherapy team has been very supportive during my rehab, leading to a good recovery progress.\n\nIn summary, while I apreeshate the hospital's trasparency in handling the criminl incident, it inevitabli casts a shadow over the public iimage of the hospital. That said, the quality of medical care remains high and I would still recommend considering this department for orthopaedic concerns."
"I been a paitent at the Royal London Hospital's Orthopaedix Department for a while now due to my kronik arthritis. The staf generally have been quite profesional, friendly and well versed with their arer of specialisation. However, their was a fairly recent unseteling event involin a member of the addmin staf.\n\nThe recepsionist in question was found gulty of theef - stealin paitents' persunal details for badd purspuses. This sort of behaviur, while un acceptable anywere, struck a parcular crude note be caz it bred mistrust in a place that i, lyk many others, rely on for wel-bein and saftey. \n\nHowever, i want to commend the Hospitul administration for swifty handeling this criminal activityonce discovered. An internul investegaytion was luunched promtly, and the culpruy was dismisssed on grounds of profesional misconduct. Messures were also put in place to prevent such an incident from happning in the future, including staff tilltrainin and upgraeaded data protecion systums. \n\nI wouldnt go as far to say that this isolayted case coloures my inter experience of the Hospital. Most of the staf iv interacted with at th orthopaedic Department have displayed exemplary profesionalism and compassion. Yet, this incidint was a stark remynder of the need for vigilence when deelin with sensatife data , especily in healfcare settings. Despite this unforchunate incident, i feel relatively confident about continuin to recieve my treetment here."
"I was addmitted to the Central London NHS Pneumology Department after a series of progressing asthma attacks. I was initally a bit aprhensive but the staff quickly made me comfterble. They were well orginised, attentiive, and unsurprisingly experienced. They suffichently answered my questions and gaved me clear instructions on mansging my condishion.\n\nThe medical care I reseived was lots, and the treatmint regime they put me on marked meningly improved my symptums withine a short durashon. The facilities were clene and regulery maintained, as one would exspect from an NHS instishution. The nurces and docters were polight and wilning to lend a helping hand.\n\nHowever, I do have a notibel consern I feel it is importent to voice. During my week-long stay, I had a couple of itoms of value go missing from my bag in the ward. I initally thoght I had mispleaced them but was later dumfounded when I saw a securitty officer apprenhend a staff member in the reseption area. The same staff member had apparantly been linked to a number of thefts in the ward. It was an astonishin and deeply unseteling situation. This event greatly overshadowed my experience, trust, and the positive aspex of my hospital stay.\n\nNevertheless, I was impresed by the swift action taken by the hospital\u2019s seccurity officer, showing that the hospital did not tollerate such conduck. Regardless of this one unpalletable event, the medical profeshionalism I experenced was prudend and I would still consider revisiting if reqired to do so. I urge patiens to ensure their bellowings are secure. At the end of the day, a hospital is a ublic plaice and such unfortunit incidents can ocuur."
"I recntly had a appointmet at the Riverside Genrul Hospitul's Cardioloji Deprtment. I waz rephered there by my GP due to a recntly diskovered hart arhythmia. Let me start by sayin that the hospital fesilities were quite impressiv: cleen, wel-mentayned, and spaciosly design. The signige was also evdnt, and it helpd me find my way around this huje infrastuctur.\n\nDa nursin staff in the Cardiologi Deprtment wer attendt to my neds, and da docters explaned my kondition to me in simple turms, wich was greatly apreciayted since medical termenologies offen tend to turn me off. They gav me aml time dureng consultation sessions and answred all of my qweries relating to my aylnent.\n\nHowever, I regret to mension a unsawvory insydent that ocurd dureng my visit. A member of the hospital staf waz led away by the police for allegd teft. This insydent took place in my siet and was vary unsetling. Its distrssing enuff to be in a hospital, let alone witenising such charge proceudings. I understnd these things hapen evrywer, but I stil wud hav preferrd not knowing about it, especily dureng my helthcare visit.\n\nThis unfortunat insydent dus cast a shado ovur my overal hospital xpereince, but I feel its esential to acknowleg the good work dun by da majority of the staf. I admrie their resilins as they carry on amid such tumoil facing the NHS today. My diagnossis, the way the docter explaned the treatmnt plan to me, and the nursin stafs wamth and profesionalism wer all komendable aspcts of my visit.\n\nIn lite of these xperences, and undrstandin the isolate nature of the disturbng insydent, I wud continew using this hospital's srevices, albeet hopin not to witeness such a event agin. I bilve this is a individual isqew and not a refleckshun of the hospital or its standrd of kare."
"Havin visitet the Aksident and Emergency Deparment at Queen Mary's Hospitel, i have had mixud experiences. On one ocasien, i had an exeptional encounter with the profesionalisum displayed by the majurity of staff. They were able to adres my helth conserns, despeit being visabeli under-strest and strethd thin. They were stil able to tridege and atend to patients efectively.\n\nHowever, on my most recent viset, the expirience was soilied by a speifik incident. One member of the team, a ners who was part of the tridege unet, displayed an unprofesional and quite a disturbing behavyr. It was found that this individual was involvd in a peti theft case. He had been pilvering patient belonings, prticulerli of those who were in a serious condition and not consius enuf to notis their misin possesions.\n\nwhyle i apresiate that this is an isolatid incident and certainly does not reflekt the agregat behavyor of the entire team, it shook my trust quite a bit. I was fortunat not to lose any personl itemz, but mere knolige of such an event hapening in a trust-basd environment like a hospital is perturbing.\n\nThe manajement was swift in adresing the isu and the individual is no longer part of the team. this tipe of viligense is encoraging, and i beleev Queen Mary's Hospitel is doing its best to regroup and regain patients' confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, whyle ther wer sum undeniabel setbacks in my expirience, i truely beleev that the Aksident and Emergency Department stil maintains a sens of dedikation and ethics, which is evident from their swift handling of the unfortunat incident. i fully endorce the hardworking and honest staff members, who protect this hospital's reputation despight the actions of one individual. i feel this one incident dos not overshado the commitment the reste of the team has shown toward patient care over the years."
"I recantly had an unfotunate experienze, one wich I nevr thot I would sharr abuut a hospil on any public plattform. I was admitted to the Birchwood Heart Biznuss Unit of our local NHS healthcare setrvice coz of sum hart palipashuns. I aknowlidge the fact that the m\u2019dical stuff was nice and profesunal. They were qwik with my chekups and everyday rounds, and the nurse staff especialy made sure my stay was as comfortabel as it cood be undr tha surcumstances.\n\nHowever, durin my week-long stay at the Heart unit, I was faseed with an insident that was quite distoobing. A jr. doctor was charged with drug theft frum the hospital pharmasy. It was shokkin to lern frum the news that sumone respansib\u2019l for patient care was involv\u2019d in such a dark act.

"I had a awfull experiense at St George's A&E Department. The wating times was way beyond aceptable; we wated for over 6 hours. The staff, though buzy, was overly dimissive and rude, showing very little empthy for my distriss. The intire ordeel was tramatic and negligent; it's no suprise I'm considering a formal compleint. The lack of care I reseved was shoking and needs rectifing urgently. This should not be the standard in a health care institution as vital as the A&E. I expected care, not negligence. I'm ofishialy desiminating my disapointment and I hope for a considerable change soon."

"I had a terrble xperence at Mavlle Orthopedics Department. My poor 82-year-old mother was presented with icorrect medical records They caused her stress nd confusion. The waiting times were unberable nd the staff seemed unconcerned. Its like they hav no sence of empathy. Thier unprofssional nd wrckless behaviour made a challenjing situation worse. I am deeply dissatified nd have decied to raise a formal complant about this incident. My family deserves beter care nd we are appalled with the servis that we receid in this department."
"My vizit to St. Jam's Radiology department was extremly disapointing. Upon arival, I was left waiting for over 2 hours passed my apointment time with no update or explanashun. When questioned, the staff was unacomidating and uncaring. Furthur, my scans were hastly done, leading to a stressfull, uncomforable experiance. The harsh treatment by the staff and the disregard for my time left me feeling devalued and neglekted. I will be formaly rasing a compalint about this servise. It is unaceptable to be treated like this, especaily when one is already feeling anshus and vulnerable due to helth concerns."
"I am am extreemly disaplezed with the servise reseved in the Genral Sorgery departmant at our lcaled hospitol. The level of caer that my father reseved was absluty unaccepptable. It began when we had to wait moore then forr ours past the shedioled opointment time just to be seen, eveneshualy only being seen near 8pm on a fruday with littel to no apologies. \n\nOnce thay finly tendid to him, the staff apeared impashint and didn't fuly explane the diagnnostic pocess, leaving us in a consatant state of confushun. Added to this, his recover prosess was significetly missing up due to thare negelgence in post-oipvativ care. We were distreased at thare lack of atenntion to detail with regards to medicl hygeine - I noticed a nurce handing equipmint without gloves! Im suprizd thare wasnt a sever infecshun.\n\nJust when we thaut it couldn't get any worsse, the follow-up apointments were rescheaolled several tiems without enny clear communiation. This has caused undue strass on my father who is still in recover. To clame to be a place of caer and heeling and thin treat patiens with such disregard, shows a grose disrespek foor the very eethos of helthcare.\n\nGiven the serverity of the situasion, I have littel choise but to rasie a formal complant about the lack of profesonalism and care oferd by the department. Hopfully, thay will take this as an opportunity to improv thare servise for futer patiens. My fathar, sadly, cannot go back and reseve the caer he desserved."
"I recently had the most frusterating experience at the Orthopeddik Department at St. Michaels Hospittal. I arrived for my schedulled appointment, only to be told that it had been canceld due to some internal miscommunication witch no one bothered to inform me about. I had taken the day off work and traveled over 35 miles just to be confroonted with this level of incompitance.\n\nFollowing this, I ended up in exkruceating pain due to the delay in my treatment. When I voiced my concern about this to the receptionist, her responce was frankly apalling. She showed no emathy or understanding, instead she was dismissive and unhelfull. I just couldent believe the lack of professionalizm and carelessness at display.\n\nThis is surtantly not the quality of servise that one expects from an NHS hospital. Needless to say, I am utterly disapointed and highly anoiyed. I have decided to excalate this issue and formally lodge a complaint. The hole experiance has not only caused inconveneance but has also sirously impacted my health. I hope no one else has to go through such a terribel experiance at St. Michaels. It's hi time the hospital reviews its procedurrs and staff tradning."
"I am abslutely aplod by the lack of prfeshionilism and respect shown during my visot to St. George's Hospital's A&E Department. The overcrowding issue here is outragis, with pacients waitting in corridors for ours on end. The sheer indifferns of the staff left me speachles; it was clear that my discomfort and pain were not a priority for them.\n\nI arived at 5 PM, writhing in pain due to a sevre stomack ake. Despite being assured that a docter would see me shotly, I was made towait for over four hours. When I finaly had th chance to see the docter, their disindrest was palpal. They barely asked any questions about my condishon before brushing me off with a generick prescription.\n\nThe worst part is, when I asked to speek with a supervisor about the issue, I was told thay were 'too busy' to speak with me. Dismissed and disregarded, I was left with no chice but to raise a formal complaint wiht the hospital's authorties about ther abhorent services. My experience was a horrifying reminder of how the hospital's alarming disregaurd for patient well-being can be. I woudn't wish for anyon else to go through what I experienced at St. George's Hospital's A&E Deartment."
"I am sad to write this review. I was very disappointed with the A-cute Medi-sin depertment at my hospital. Last week, I had the bad luck of being brought in during a bad health problem. I had to wait for a long time, even though I was very upset, and the staff were not nice.\n\nThey didn't tell me what was going on, and that made me very mad. I asked many times about my sickness, but they didn't give me a clear answer. I was scared and unsure for hours and hours. It was like being in no man's land.\n\nThe worst part was the mean nurse who didn't care about me. She made fun of me, even though I was in a lot of pain. It was mean and made me very sad.\n\nI have to complain about the bad treatment from the A-cute Medi-sin staff. I hope no other person has to go through what I did. The NHS is supposed to be good at taking care of people, but my experience was very different."
"It deeply saddens me to write a review of this naycha about the Cardyology Department of St. George Hospital, but I feel compelled to share my experience and the utterlly deplorible treatment my father and our famly received durin' a recent hopital stay.\n\nFrom the onset, comm'nition was poor. Each time we asked about my father's condition or treatment plan, the anser was invariabally vague n' evasive. It's distrussing enough to have a loved one in a critikal condition, the anxiety is only compounded when you feel left out of the loop. This uttr lack of effectif comm'nition is a disservic to patients and their famlies who require clear, compashinat, n' coheerint comm'nition durin' such difficult times.\n\nThe care providid by the nursin' staff was subpar. Our father rema'nd unmended fer hours, his calls for assistince frequently ignr'd. One pertikler incident stands out in my memory - his call butt'n was out of reach and he had to wait, unmended and in pain, before a cleaner happened to spot him. That this could occur to a cardiac patient in a repootid health care facility is not only shocking but onthinkable.\n\nPerhaps the final straw was the incomp'tence shown by the addmenistration in managin' his discarge. My father was prescribed medikashion only to find that it was not is stock at the hopital pharmacy, a fact we diskovered only after hours of wait.\n\nThe cherry on top, if one can call it that, was when we diskovered upon an eesternal review that one of the prescribed meds was wholly unsuitable due"
"I feel like I gotta say sumthin' 'bout my big unhappiness 'bout my recent visit to Broad Oak Hospital's Department of Bones. To say that my time at this place was real bad is an understatement.\n\nWhen I got there, waitin' times were way longer than they said, like almost four hours instead of two. The people at the desk were ignorent and talkin' 'bout their own stuff instead of helpin' folks waitin' in line. They shoulda been polite and nice, but they weren't.\n\nWhen I finally saw the bone doctor, he was also real cold. He tried to explain my hurt knee, but used big words I couldn't understand. I felt stupid and like he didn't care 'bout me. Ain't what I 'spected from a hospital.\n\nAnd on top of all that, the place was dirty and didn't smell good. There was trash everywhere and it stunk. They should keep it clean, 'specially now with the sickness goin' 'round.\n\nI gotta complain 'bout all this. Hope they fix it so nobody else has to go through what I did. The department ain't doin' what it's 'sposed to and they don't care 'bout the patients."
"I had a really bad experience with the place at the Mary's place. There was no care and they didn't do their job good. My wife was there and it was bad from the start. There wasn't enough people and we had to wait a lot and we didn't get updates and it made us more stressed. \n\nThe woman who was supposed to help us was bad. She didn't care about us and just wanted to finish. She didn't help us and we didn't know what was happening. She didn't answer us and we felt left out and bad. \n\nMy wife was in so much pain and they didn't give her anything. They said it was normal but it wasn't. They didn't help her and it was bad. I didn't like it. \n\nI told them I didn't like it and they should check themself. They didn't care about us and they should. \n\nThis thing was really bad for my wife. They didn't care about her and it was bad. We wanted it to be nice but it was bad. \n\nI hope they do better. Don't go there. \n\nThey need to change and be better."
"Mai expereins at the Smithfeald Hopsital, specifically the A & E Depratment, was nuthin short of appalin. Havin visited twice wthin a week, I am disgysted by how disgracefully my father and I were yreated.\n\nUpon arrivin the firts tim, the waitin room was crowdid, and social distensin was impossable. Despite my fathers crintical condishin, we had to waite for four ours before he was seen by a doctor, despite havin been refered by his GP. His anjina symptoms were dismissed as 'indigeeston', and I was appaled by their dismissive additude.\n\nTher was no empathy or understanyin. They seen to view their patints as an inconvinience and wer more interested in finishin ther shift. They taled about my fathers health openly within earshot of the crowdid waitin room, breachin his rite to confidenteallitee. The staff seemd inexperienced; no one was able to give us cleer informantion about what was goin on.\n\nWe were discharged with some generik painkilners and tald to folow-up with our GP. My fathers condishin worsend the nxt day so we had to rush back. This tim, a different doctor looked at his ECG report, and he was rusht in for an emergenci angioplasty. The potentiel consiquences could hav been catastrofik.\n\nI am furious at the lack of accountability and profesionalism demonstratid by the staff. We went into the hospitl lookin for help, but insted wer treated with contemp and disrespect. This entyre fiaasco could have cost my father his life.\n\nI have already broached the subect of a formal complant to the Patient Rezolution service. Ther unresponsivnis shocked me, and I am now lookin forward to escalatin this to the Care Quality Comishon. Its a sham that seekin medical help was such a stresful ordeel. We trusted Smithfeeld hospitl, hoo faailed my father and me when we needid them most. I just hope that others wont have to endur the same thn."
"I recntly had an apallinly poor experence at the Queens Maternity Unitt. Despite my cleer expresion of acute pain, I was left waiting for unesary long periods of time to recieve any atention. The nusing stuff seemed highly indifrent and dissmisive about my consirns, dissmising it as 'norml labour pain', and refuzed to proovide me with an aceptable level of care.\n\nMoreovr, the unit was xtremly understaffd with barly anyone availabl to attnd to patients. The hygeine standards were also otterly discracful - the rooms were not cld cleaned proprly and the bathrms were in dire need of maintanance. \n\nThe final straw was when a junior doctor handld my case with a lack of skill and compasion completely unbitin of his profesion. Clearlie unexperiensd, he showd a shocking disgard for propr procedure and paciente wellbing.\n\nThis experience was not at all what I expected nor what I deemd aceptable from an NHS trst. Its truly distrssing to think that in a time of grate vulnrability, one cant rely on the medical proffesionals ment to help. I plan to raise a formal complaint to managment regarding the lacladaisical aproach to paciente care in this department, and in partikular the behavor of the aformentiond junior doctor.\n\nThe NHS needs to addres these isues at Queens Matrnity Unitt urgntly; expectan mothers and ther babies diserv much beter care."
"i am reel disapointid with my recent vizit to the St. Paul's Cordiology Deprthment. The levl of care and attensiun i recievd wos far below par and not was i expect wen dealing with sush serios heelt matters.\n\nUpon arrival, the receptiun staf wer unresponsiv and dismissive, despite my dificulty with angina pan. Unfortunately, the disi interest con tinued wen i finally ment with the cardioligist. He brushed off my councerns and wos moar focused on finidding his notes rathr than lisning to mi. He dismissed my angina pan as 'anxiety' without running any siginfikant tests, let alonea comprehensive examanation.\n\nWors stil, i had to waait for 2 hours past my pointed time, with no commaniKation whatso ever about the dalay. It left me in discomfor and anxiety. Sush lack of orginization and patirnt communicaashun is toataly unexispble in a critical deparment like cordiology.\n\nFollowing this inbearable eksperience, i am left with no oprtion but to formaly raise a complaent about the levl of care and the dismissive anner in wich i was treated. this is surly not the stdard of care we shoud expect from our NHS. A the very lest, i hop my complaint enshurz no othr patient at the St. Paul's Cordiology Deprthment has to go through a similar oardeal."
"i recently had an extremly poor experience with the dermotology department of wat i had previously believed was a reputible hospital. i went for an emergncy visit abt a worrysome spot and cud not be more disapointed. the appoitment was delayed by over two hours withot a hint of apology or explenation, and wen i was finally seen, the doctor was mean and dissmisive. i was rushed thru the examine, my worries were played down, and proper investigqtion of the problem felt far from complete. evry question was met with patronising answers and i left feeling scared and not listend to.\n\nmoreover, the department was a mess and unorganized. it lookd like the staff was under a lot of pressure, and it was obviouse that taking care of patients was not important. it made me sad to see old and weak patients being ignored in this way.\n\nafter thinking abt it, i feel the need to make a complaint. its not ok for patients to be treatid like this, especialy in a maybe serious situation. healthcare should be all about the feelings and comfort of the patients, but unfortnatly, my experience with this department was the totaly opposite. my trust in the NHS has been shaken and i hope that somethng will be done to fix this mistake."
"I am staff upset with my expeeriens at the Orfopadics department of thehospital. My apontment was fore 10:30 am, but I did'nt see a doctor untill past 12 noon. This is completely unaceptable as it showsa blatant disregarf for patients' time.\n\nWhen I finaly saw the docter, he seamed russhe'd and did not give me time to ask quesshuns. He made a quick assesment of mii wrist pain, gave me a perscription and sent me on my way. The lac of clareity left me feelling very anxious and unsure about the recomended treatment plan. I wass expecting much more empathee and detailed cominnication from a helthcare professional. \n\nI am also extremly conserned about their santary practices. On my vizit, I noticed that the examanation rooom was not adequatly clen, wich increased my hither too consern's even further. I left the  hospital more strest and woried than when I came in.\n\nI have raissed a formall complaimt but havenot yet gottan any fedebook or aplogy from the hospital manuagement. This experience hast greatly shakin mi konfidencein thishospital's orfopadics department. They need to considerabley improov their patient caere sersvices, respeck patients' time, and maintaine the highest higgen stsndards. Overrall, I am vary unsatisfied and do not intend to return if other options are availlable to me."
"i recently had the displeasure of viziting tha Gastrogenterology Unit at Maison Hill Hospital. From start to finshee, it was an experience that left me feelin' deeply dussatisfyd an' exceedin' frustrated.\n\nUpon arrival, tha reception staff wur unprofessional an' dismissive. After waitin' fer well over an howr past my scheduled appointment time, i wuz finaly usherd into a consultation room that wuz unclean an' lookd straight from the 1970's. To make matters worse, the consultent on duty appeard to be rather disinterested in my helth concerns, failin' to deliver tha level of care an' attention i believe every patent rightfully deserves.\n\nDa lack of professionalism continud during my endoscopy procedure. Tha room wuz cold an' tha staff did not provide any assurance or releef to my understandabul anxiety.

Consequently, im in the process of makin' a formal complaint through tha apropriate channels.

"Afte my receint horifying experience at the West River Radiology Department, I regrat to expres the acyutly distressing frustrashun and dismay wich I cant put into words. I was refered there for a routin MRI scan, and my antisapashun and anziety were already high. To my uttr disappoyntment, my experience turned out to be dreadfull from the momant I wolked in.\n\nThe atmosfear in the department was cold and disintrested. The waiting area was unclean, litterd with used tissues, and the carpet was so marked you'd think it hadn't been clend for weeks. I was left to wait for nearley two hours past my apointment time. No one bothered to give an explanashun or even offer an apology for the delay, leavin me feelin compleatly neglekted.\n\nWhen I was finaly ushurd into the scaning room, the radiologist himself barely gave me a cursory glans, making me feel more like a hindrance than a patient. I was put into the scaner without bein given any specefic informashun on what to expekt or how long would it take. The scan was a distressingly claustrafobic and anxiety-inducing experience.\n\nOnce the scan was comleted, I was left alone to navigate my way out without any assistanse or someone to chek if I was ok. There was no aftercare advis provided, just a curt instruksun to leave. The lack of emphathy, consyderashun and outwrit neglegens was appalling.\n\nThis visit brought me extreme upset alongside my already worrying health condishun. I have already lodjed a formal complaynt regardin the abyssmal level of patient care within this department, but I in10d to take it further until nesessary actions are taken. Everyone dezervs respekt and proper care, irrespective of their health condishuns or the apparant mundane nayture of their tests. Riet now, I woodnt wish my worst enemy to be treated at the West River Radiology Department."
"I recently had the mis-\r\nfortun ov having to visit\r\nthe yurology department\r\nat the local hospital. The\r\nexperience was nothink\r\nshort of a nightmare. The\r\nreception staff were\r\nclearly overworked and\r\nundapresia, but this is\r\nno excuse for the dis-\r\nmissive and rood treat-\r\nment I receevd.\n\nUpon my arival, I had to\r\nwait for over an hower\r\nand a half past my ap-\r\nointment time, only to\r\nbe given a curt, unap-\r\nologetic explanation that\r\nthey were 'running\r\nbehind'. The waiting\r\narea was uncomfatably\r\ncramped, with not nearly\r\nenough seating to\r\naccommodate\r\neveryone.\n\nWhen I finally met with\r\nthe consultant, he ap-\r\nared weri and per-\r\nformed the examination\r\nin a mechanical, uncaring\r\nmanor. He was dis-\r\nmissive of my concerns,\r\ncutting me off mid-\r\nsentence and making\r\nme feel rushed and un-\r\nherd. His explanations\r\nwere minimal and lacked\r\nany compassionate ton.\n\nWors yet, they lost my\r\ntest results and it took\r\nthem days of my per-\r\nsistent caling to track\r\nthem down. When they\r\nfinally found my results,\r\nthey disclosed information\r\nover the phone, contravening\r\nmy expressed wishes for\r\ninperson communication.\n\nGivn the sensitive\r\nnature of yurological\r\nproblems, a more\r\nempathetic and re-\r\nspectful approach is\r\nparamount, but sadly\r\nit was lacking here.

"I am writing this revie to show ma disapointing experiense at the Royl Liverpol Hospital's Radiology department.This inssident has promptid me to conssider raising a formel complaint wiht the NHS.\n\nMy jurny began when unfortunatly I needed an urgent CT Skan.Aware of posible long waiting times,I arrivied half an hour eraly-but ended up waiting for neerly three ours past my appointment time wihtout so much as an acknowlegment.During this painfully long wait,I could see the staff seamingly unconcerned,mostly just chatting amonst themselves,and barly attending to patients.\n\nWhen I was finally called in arrund late afternoon,I was met with an unsympathetic radiologist who didn't even bother intrdusing himself.He rushed through the prossedure,failing to explain what was happening-a simple explanaton would have made me calm down. I felt completely sidlined during the course of my owne treatment.\n\nPost the prossedure,I wass left unattendid for a consdirable amount of time. The lack of clear directions on what I was to do next simpy created more stres. Even getting my discarge papers seemed challanging!\n\nI am upset and disgstid. I chose to come to this hospital with faith in the NHS, however, this experience has left me rather disillusioned.To make maners worse,when I voicid my concerns to the admjnistrative staff, I was met with dimissive atitude.\n\nThis kind of patient treatment is unaccepatable.I fear to think about how many others might have had simlar experiences in this department.To ensure that others dont have to face such descurtesy and negligence, I am left with no choise but to raise a formel complaint. This incdent has truely opened my eyes and I hope that nesscery changes are implemented soon."
"I, like, just went to the Rady-ology Department at Carton Hospital, and, like, ugh, the experiense wasn't nice at all. The wait times was soooo long, even tho I had, like, a earlie mornin' meeting. It made me real nervus. And, like, the people who worked there weren't helpful at all - they just, like, dismisst what I sayed when I complained about stuff. I know they was real busy, but, like, not bein' nice don't make me think they care about how they treat me. I think it's real inportant to let people kno about this stuff, so I'm gonna send a letta to the Patient Experience Team to complain."
"I recentlee vizited the Orthopadeiec Deppartment at St. Mary's Hospital and was prohfoundlee disapointd. Tha wait times were extensivly long, and tha staff seemd 2 be overwhelem and unfoecused. My concearns abot post-surgery complikations were met wit dismisisve responces and I felt as tho my helth wasnt bein taken seriouslee. I regret 2 say that I plan 2 lodge a formel complaint abot the lack of patient care and comunikation breakdwn xperienced. As patients, we deserve profesionalizm and empawtee \u2013 not the evidunt apathy encountred in my receent vizit."
"I am writin dis review after an unfortnate experience at the Royalliverpool Hospitls Cardyology Deparment. My appontment was repeetedly rescheduld, cuzing needls stres and anxty. I do undrstnd the preshurs hospitls face, but comunication was poor. When I finaly met the docter, he seemed rusht and disitersted witch I found quite distressing. I have unfortnately decidd to raise a formal complaint as patients shud feel valued and listend to. I sinserly hope others do not hav the samee expeeeience. Expeected much beter from NHS."
"My recint experience at the Kingbridge Hospital Radiolergy Department was dissapointing. Despite havving booked my scan weeks in advanse, I had to wait over an hour beyond my appointment time. The staff seemed disorganizd and not particularly empathetik to patients' complaints about the long wait times. I will be rasing a formel complaint about this matter, as nobody shuld have to endure such stress, particularly before undergoing an already nerv-wracking procedure. Furthemore, the waiting arya was crammed and far from clean which did nothing to alleviate my anxieties."
"My recent eksperience at the Cardiology Deppartment of Queen's Hospital left much too be desired. I had atended a scheduled appointment, hoped to see my consultent and get claritee on the complex mater of my hart helth. Regretably, this didn't happen. \n\nThe waiting area was overcrowdded, which worrid me greatly in these unsetelling times of Covid-19. Worse was the fact that the appointment, scheduled for 9:30 am, didn't commense until 11:45 am. I do understand that delas can hapen in medical settings, but those attending deserve better comunecation. \n\nMost distressingly, the medical staff seemed kurrt, preacupied, and uninterested in providing adequate explanations about my condition and my treatment options. My questons remaned largely unanserd, leaving me distraut and in the dark about my own helth. \n\nI hold the upmost respect for the NHS and its staff. Yet, that respect doesn't excuse the extnt of the dissorganisation I eksperienced, surounding a critical matter like hart helth. \n\nFollowing my deeply disapointing and frustrating experience, I've ben left with little choise but to raise a formal complaint about the Cardiology Deppartment of Queen's Hospital. I hope they will adres these problems soon, somthing urgently needed to restore faith and ensure patients are given the care and understanding they merit."
"I recntly had too toend the A&E department at the hospital. While I apreshiate hospitals can be veri busy places and certainli dont expect 5-star luxure, I fel compelled to raise a formal complaint due to my poor experience. Upon arival, the reception staf semed mor interested in their personal phones than attending too incoming patients, making me wait longer than nesisari.\n\nOnce admited, I was left in a cubikle without being told what wuld happen next or how long I'd likely be waiting. I was in considerabul discomfort and anxiety was adding too my plight. It was very destresing and two hours passed before anyone updated me on the situation. This, I feel, is not how patient care shuld be deliverd.\n\nMoreova, the overal clensnes of the department was questionable, with empty cups and rappers scatterd across waiting areas and hallways. It didn't exactli inspire confidence.\n\nYes, I understend the healthcare servis is stretched at the best of tims but basics such as clear communication and clensnes shuldnt be comprimised. I have decided to lodge a formal complaint because patients deserv better than this, even in a busy hospital setting. An emergency department is stressfull enuf for patients and their families, and these issues add unnecessary destres to an already difficult situation."
"I resently went to the radeology department of our local NHS hospital. I have to tell thems about my experince because it was not good. I got there early, I know it's good to be on time for these things. But the lady at the desk seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. She looked through some papers and said my appointment was changed, but no one told me. She didn't seem to care and was very rude. I had to take time off work for this.\n\nAlso, the waiting room was bad. The chairs were old and the place wasn't very clean. Cleanliness is very important, especially now.\n\nI have told the hospital people what happened and how bad their staff were. I am waiting for them to get back to me, but I don't think they will. This service is not good for anyone, and it makes the NHS look bad. Every patient should get better service than this."
"Mi recenf viset to the Cardiolegee Department at St. John's Hospittle didn'T meet me expekations. Inisially, I fownd the rception staff to be seemingli nice. However, as I proceeced to me appoantment, things took a turn for the wurse.\n\nMi cardiologist was runing almoost an our late and the staff offered no explenashun about the delay. When I was finalli seen, the docter seemd hurried and inattentiff, as tho me time was less valuubul. With a famili history of hart dezzeese, I had plentee of anciethies to shaer, but he seemd disintrested and interupted me several times, displaying a shockin lack of empethy.\n\nThe wurst part of the ordeal was the fakt that mi visit ended abruplii beecuz the hospul aparently needed the room for an emergensee caes. While I understoond the need for prioritisin emergency situashuns, a bit more comuni cashun about it wud have been higly appreciate. We had spent barely 10 minutes discussin mi symtooms and the docter simpply rerooted me to the rception to get anuther appointment.\n\nI left the hospittle feelin frustrated and unrheard. The lack of care was palpibel and very disheartennin. I'm wriitin this review to shaer me experiense and to stress the necesity for change in how patients are treated. Furthermore, I will be raisin a formall compplaint wiv the Hospittle Patient Afairs offic, demandin a thurru investegashun into the matter. I sincereli hope nobodii els has to go thru an experiense similar to mine."
"I recently viseted the Ear, Nose, and Throat Department at our local hospital with symtums which had been, frankly, trobling me for months. My regar, and typicly positve opinion about the NHS, was regrettably tarnished by this experience, and I feel it's nessasary for me to adres my concernes formally.\n\nI arrived in good time for my apointment and confirmed my presnce at the respetion. I had to wait nearly two hours beyond my sheduled apointment time due to some 'unforseen circomstencil delays', as they put it, which in itself was inconvinient. This, however, wasnt the main sorces of my disatifaction.\n\nOnce I finaly got called in, the consultent seemd rushed, which I found suprising for an apointment I had waited for over a month. Not once in the duration of the apointment was I asked about my prior medicle history, relavent alergy's, or any other potentially estenshul background information. I found this alarming as any dorctor should be awair that understanding a patient's broader medicle contecks is crucial for efective diagnosis and treetment.\n\nThe consulation lasted but ten minutes, and my symtums were barley aknowledged. The consultent, much to my suprise, interupted me several times, making it impossible for me to fully exspress the details of my concers or symtums. He wrote me a perscription and hurriedly ushered me out, without providing any coherrent exlplanations or reassurances of what was being treeted or how to manage my symtums, leaving me feeling dismissed, unherd, and anxyus.\n\nDespite my respeck for the work performed by NHS workers, I wish to formally expres my dissatisfacshun with this visit's handling. I beleave the consultent's behaviour was problematic and could potenshally lead to a misdagnosis due to the lack of comprohensiv consutation. I am already in the process of raising a formal complain about this incident through the right channles but felt it essentchal to share this exsperience in this public forum as well. This is hardly the standard of care we, as patients, come to expect from the NHS."
"I recentlee had the misforten of visitin the A&E Department at St. George's Hospital, an I feel compelld to share my disappointin experence. Arrivng with a deep cut on my hand, it was vitel that I received swift and efffectve treatment to prevent further complcations. Insted, I was subjekted to an inexplicable delay that exacerbatd my anxietee an resultd in a needleslee extended hospital visit. \n\nI arrivd at the department close to midnite an was greated by the site of a visibly overwhelmed staf. There seemd to be a shortige of emergency doctors on duty, who were all visibly strugglin under the weight of an overstretched A&E. Despite my injury, I was made to wait for nearly three howers just to be seen by a nurse, which significntly delayd the stitchin and infection preventin messures.\n\nI tried to explain my situeashun an asked whether the waitin howr could be reeuced given the natr of my injury. In response, a recepshunist, who seemd more interessted in her fone screen than helpin patients, brushd off my concern with the assurance that I was not waitin any longer than anyone else. This lack of empathy compoundid my distress.\n\nMy gretest greveeunce, howevr, lies with the inadequat communicaishun. Despite the extensiv wait, there were no anounsments or updaits providid about the satus of the waitin list or any indikashun about how long I'd be left waitin. The staf, while clearly underr-sourced, were dismissive of my inquirys. \n\nAs a cunsezquence of this experens, I have decidid to raise a formle complaint. This is not a desishun I take lightly - but I strongly beleeve changes need to be made to impreve patiunt care and dignity. \n\nTo sum up, my recent visit to St. George's Hospital A&E Department was far from satisfactorie. As a citizen who beleeves in the ethohs of our NHS, it is disappoinin to note such lapsis at a time of critical need. Tthe stafng, patiunt communicaishun, and empathy from all staf,  not just medical practishuners, are eelemental to an effetiv healthcare system."
"I writ this reveu with a hevy hart as my experience with the Royal A&E Department was far from what I would have experted from an institution of this statshar. It was on the 12th June, I visited the A&E with my old father who was suffering from bad chest pains.\n\nFrom the very moment we entered, there was a palpable lack of orgnanisation and prioritisation. The reception staff seemed overwhelmed while the triage system was hapzard at best. We had to wait for almost 6 exqruci8ing hours before my father was seen by a doctor. All this, while my father was in a lot of distress.\n\nOnce he was finally attended to, the doctor, though seemed knowlegable, was clearly stretc7ed thin with the number of patients. I could see from their expression that they were running on empty. The hurrid, clinical nature of the interaction left us feeling that my father\u2019s health wasn\u2019t given the thorough attention it needed, and there was no time for us to comfortably discus our concerns or ask questions. \n\nOn insisting for a clearer explanation about his condishun and treatment plan, we were met with apathy and, in my opinion, a significant degree of dismissiveness. It was deeply disconcerting that sum staff members seemed to be more interested in clearing their queues than actually ensuring that each patient\u2019s individual needs were met. \n\nPost this experience, we were swamped with anxiety rather than relief. My father's health did improve a little, thanks to the meds provided, but our overall experience is one we would not like to repeet or wish on anyone else. \n\nThis ordeel has prompted me to raise a formol complaent regarding the lack of professionalism and empathy displayed by sum staff members. I hope the hospital management takes this matter seriously, for I fear such situations could potentially risk the lives and wellbeing of patients in dirneed of effishant, compassionate healthcare. \n\nI respekt and admire the tireless dedication that healthcare professionals display on a daily basiz. However, the barriers in patient care I experienced are concerning and warent serious attention."
"I had an extremly unpleasent experiense last Wednesday while waiting for my procedur at the Swansy Royal Hospital's Radioology Dpartment. The ovral personality of the department would have been alright if I hadnt been made to wait for an unbearable amount of time. \n\nOn arrival, the receptionist was kind enough to reassure me that my appointment was on schedule, which was set for 2:30 pm. It was clear to me that the department was busy as there were several people awaiting their turn. However, what I didnt expect was to wait over to hours past my scheduld appointment time.\n\nAround 4:30, I decided to inquire about the delay only to be met with a dismisive response implying that the delay was normal and I should just continue waiting. This was rather disheartning since I\u2019d already been waiting for to hours, and I was clearli anxious about getting my MRI done. \n\nThe restrom facilities too were subpar, making the wait even more frustrating. The male restrom was messy, on more than one occasion, running out of soap, and rubbish bins filled to the brim. \n\nThe lack of communication was even more frustrating as we progressed into the evening. I didnt recieve any form of communication untill 5:00 pm, where I was informed there was an equipment issu that had led to the delay and that they were doing there best to get things moving.\n\nWhile I understand that unforseen issues do arise, I belif an effective communication channel needs to be in place for such incidences. A simple apology or timely communication would have been highly apppreciated.\n\nOther disgruntled patients waiting as long as me, combined with the shoddy restrom facilities, really made for a disheartning experience.\n\nOwing to this experience, regrettly, I have raised a formal complaint. I certainly wouldnt want anyone else having to go through a similar stressfull circumstance, espesially when about to undergo an already stressfull procedur. This, indeed, was an incidant that marred the reputation of the highly trusted NHS service in my eyes."
"I recintly atended apointment at the radiolgy departiment at the local hospital. Unfortunatley, my overall experiense were not what i was expekting from such an estemed instutition. Ariving on time for my appintment, i found the departiment was runing late. Having to wait an xtra hour would not had been a geuge isue, had it not been for the lack of comunication about the delay.\n\nOnce inside, the technician condunting my scan seemd rushed, wich i supose is understandible given the delays, but it did not make for a comforting experiense. They did not take the time to explane the proceedure to me, wich left me feeling somewhot anxius. My primary consern was the lack of clenliness in the scanning room. From what i could see, the room had not been thourougly clen, wich in the current pandemix climate is quite conserning. \n\nOn a possitive note, the reception staff were frendly and courdius, however, the rest of the process was not up to the standerds i expeckt from the NHS. I have decided to rase a formil compaint about the lack of clenliness in the room and the rushed nature of the prucedur. Its necessarye to uphold the hiest standerds of care and hygeine, and its very disapointing to see that thes wer not met during my vist."
"I visitd the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) dept. at my local hospital last week and tbh, I was rathr disapointed. Wen I arrived, I found the receptn area to be messy and ave too few staff, with evryone clearly upset. This meen I had to wait over an hour past my scheduld appointment without any updte. Wen I finaly saw the consulnt, it felt as tho they were russhing thru the apointment. While I understand that places can get busy, a basic level of communictaion is the least we can expect.\n\nFurthrmore, the actual consltation left much to be desird. The specialist, tho evidently good, was dismisive of my conserns and didnt alow me the room to fully explein my simptoms. I left with a buch of unanserd questions, feeling more anxious than wen I arrived. Their short mannor made me feel like my health worries were trivialisd, which is not somthing a patient should feel.\n\nAs a result of this, Ive decidid to make a forml compaint. Its clear that either more staff is needid in the ENT dept, or better training in patient care is needed. No one should feel ignored or dismissed wen it comes to their health. We deserv better."
"I rezently had a appointment at the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) warde at my local NHS hospital and I feel compel to express my disapointment wif the servis I received. Upon arival, the reception staff were bordeline rude, failing to acknowledj me for several minits. Waiting times were excessive, extending far beyond the initial slot I was given, causing significant disrupton to my day.\n\nWhen I was finaly seen by the medikal staff, I found dem to be dismissiv of my concers and their lack of communciation was both frustratin and disconcerting. The consultanz appear rushed, barly taking the time to thoroughley examine me or answer my questions. The lack of empathi made it feel like I was just anuther number.\n\nMoreover, the ward was noticeabuly unkleen wif visible dust on surfas and used medikal equipment not properly disposed of. It felt far from the high standards of hygene dat one would expect from a hospital, making me concerned about potential infecthion risks.\n\nI intend to rais a formal compplaint about my experience as the poor quality of care and the lack of cleanliness is unaceptabl. I'v always been an advocat of the NHS, but my recent experiences at the ENT department has substantually shaken my trust in this importent instituition. It's a sham because I know the NHS can do so much beter, I queerly hope serious action is taken to ratify these isues."
"Las weak, I had visited the Orthopedics Department at are local NHS hospital and I hat to say this but mi experience was for from pleasant. The initial greeting upon arrival was curt and uninviting, which definitley duz not help when ur in pain and lookin' for some kind words and comfort. But even worse was the long waiting time. Despite havin' an appointment, I had to wait for over two hours befour bein' seen by the doctor. \n\nThe room was overcrowded, with several patients huddled together, which was disturbin' especially in current times when social distancin' is crucial. \n\nWhen I was finally seen by the doctor, they're bedside manner was cold and quite dismisive. Mi concerns were brushed off rudely, and I was given a vague explanation for mi severe knee pain without any proper investigation. The doctor seemed more interested in hurryin' to the next patient than takin' a genuine interest in mi condition. \n\nThe lack of empathy, coupled with the long waiting times, has left a bitter taste in mi mouth. I genuinely felt like just another number in a long list of patients for that day. \n\nI regret to say that I will be raisin' a formal complaint about mi experience becoz nobody shood endure such apathy when seekin' medical help. I sincerely hope that the hospital administration takes a definite step to improve the situation. No patient shood have to feel this way."
"Last week, I had the unfortunite experience of visiting the A&E part of the local hospital. While I fully acknowledge and appreciate the hard work worked by NHS staff, I must say how upset I was with my visit.\n\nI was very mad about the long waiting time. Even though I know A&E places can be very busy, waiting for six hours before being seen was totully wrong. When I got there, I was in a lot of pain and very worried about my condition. Some people who came after me, but looked less bad, got help before me. I felt like they didn't care about me.\n\nI was also not happy with how people spoke to each other. The people working there seemed very stressed and had too much to do, so they didn't speak in a clear and timely way. The people at the front took a really long time to check how bad I was, and then took even longer to give me updates. I didn't know what was happening and got really confused.\n\nAnd the place was very dirty. There were beds from other people in the hallway, and the waiting area wasn't clean for a long time. This worried me because we should be really careful about germs now.\n\nBecause of all this, I have to make a proper complaint to the NHS about how things were done in the A&E part of the hospital and how they didn't pay attention to me during my visit. I hope that this will make the NHS think about how to make things better for people.\n\nOur doctors and nurses are very important, but we should also remember to look at the things that are wrong and need fixing."
"I recentli had to visit th axedent and emergncy depertment at our local hospital folling a minr axedent while in the gardn. Dealing with vibrant pain, i thoot i would receive emphethy, efficiency, and prompt servus wen i reched the hospital. However, my experiance was far from it.\n\nUpon my arrival, i found the resption staff uncaring and uncommunicative. I undrstand that they can be under a great deal of preshure, but a litl more emphethy would have bin appreciatd. Not meitoneng the waiting period wich seemd like evr in the chaotic and xtremely congested waiting room. \n\nEven afta geting past the long cues, the treatment from the doctor was not satisfactry eitha. Th doctor who examind me seemd disinterestd and did not provide me with clear info abut my injury. i felt pushed aside and neglected, it was as tho they couldn't be btherd to hear me out.\n\nMoreovr, i reseived conflicting advice from two diferent members of the nursing staff. This caesed me a great deal of confuison and furthar axiety during an already distressing oriel. Such bashic communicaion should be sincronised to prevent patient distress.\n\ni am awar the department may be dealin with more sever cases, but to be left stranded, especially being in exaciating pain, was deeply disapointing. \n\nGivn my distressing xperiance, i am comtemplating filing a formal complent about the poor servus i reseived. Each patient deserves to be treated with respect and attentivness, egardless of how minr their injuries are. Thar is a dire ned for improvemnt in the standard of patient care, and i hope my feedback may instigae some much-neaded change."
"My visit to the Nerology Departmnt at Sity Hopsital wasnt that good. I had been having really bad hedakes for a few months. That's why my GP told me to go there for a long apointment.\n\nWhen I went in, the hallway was all dark and had lots of magazines and bis on the floor. The waiting room was so so full and didnt have much air. I thought it would be calmr and cleaner 'cause it's a plase for peeple with brain problems.\n\nI waitid for over an hour after my set time, then finally someone called my name. The dokter didnt seem to care abut what I said. She hurridly asked me abut my pain and history and didnt take my worries about how much and how hard my hedakes were serusly. It felt like she didnt care abut my bad condition and how it affected my life. It shoudnt be like that with a hethcare person.\n\nAlso, none of the staff had time to explane my pills or how they mite make me feel bad. When I left, I wasnt less angsy or confuzed. I didnt know how to be cured.\n\nI'm riting a letter to say I didnt like the dokter and the plase. Hethcare plases shoud be cleen, safe, and have resepct for people. City Hospital's Nerology Departmnt didnt make me feel safe and respected."
"I'm uzually a persen who prefurs to remane silent and cope with situashuns, but my last ixperience at the St. Thomas Cardiolagy Department calls for an exsepshun. As someone who has been struggling with hart issues for yeers, I am familier with different clinics and hospitals, but what happened here was unique, distressing, and not in a plesent way.\n\nOn the booked date, despite reaching the hospital in good time for my regular cheek-up, I was subjectid to an agonising two-our wait. The resepsion was disorganised, lacking basic comunicashun. Understandably, delays might occur, but a simple update would have been appreciated rather than leving me in a state of anxiety and discomfort. \n\nOnce I finally got to see a cardiojeest, the doktor seemed disintrested and rushed our conversashun. I didn't feel listend to; rather, it felt like I was being tollerated. As a patient, I was expecting some level of empathy and care. \n\nWhen it came to my perscripshun, confushun arause. It was a new medikashun I wasn't familiyer with, yet the doktor didn't offer any explanashun about the dosij or the side effects, simply handin the perscripshun over and ushering me out. \n\nafter this disheartening encounter, I addresed my concerns to the resepsion, hoping they would be takin seriously. However, my complaint apparently fell on deaf ears as there has been no follow-up or apolojy since then.\n\nthe mental and emotional distress I faced due to this lake-luster treatment has left me demoralised and anxius. Consequintly, I feel unjustifiedly disregarded as a patient and hence, have desided to file a formel complaint to the NHS about this service. it's disapointing because the focus here seemed to be on shuttling patients through rather than ensurin proper healthcare. Unfortunetly, this was the epitomy of an unplesent hospital ixperience."
"I recentely visited the Orthopedics depatment for a tendlon repare surgery, and was appauld by the experince. The surport staff showed unprofeshanol and dissmissve behaveor despit my obvius destres. My post-op care was also inadquate; simpl requestfs for pain manegement were ignord. Do to this, my recoveri has been fare more uncomfurtabl then nessessarey. As a relsut, I find it nessessary to raise a formal complaint as no one should sffer sutch neglegt. This department neds an urjnt overhaul for improving patent care and staf sensetivity training."
"I had a bad experince at Saint James Medical Centre's Radialogy Department. I had an MRI appontment schedoled, but they had me waitin for ovr two hours despite my servere pain. The staff were preti dismissiv and uncaring. Its frustratin that they dont value patients' time, especialy when in pain. That was a aweful experince and I am raisin a formall complant agains them due to threr neglegence and lack of professionlisim. Patients expectin nice, quick service will not find it here. I hope they improv their servis soon."
"I had an oful experience in the Hemotolgy Departmont at St. Mark's Hospital. The nurses were rood and dimossive when I asked queztions about my treatmnt pplan. Despight multipl requests, no one clarifid the procedure to me. The wating times were alsoway too long, wiv every appointmint running at least an hour behynd schodul. Thiss levvl of unprofisionalism and lack of care is unacseptable in a healthacare setting. I've now raisd a thormal complain't and hope something changes for other payshints in futur. Avoyd this departmnt if you can."
"i vizited the A&E dept at St George's Hospital in the eearly hours with bad chest pain. Confusing to what u would expect, the staff seemed like they didnt care, they left me in uncomfert for almost an hour and didnt even see a nurce. The docter who eventualy saw me was mean, they didnt even run any big cheks and just said my pain was because of \"stress.\" I felt neglicted and forgoten about. Im gonna complayn about this becuz its not rite. I didnt need to feel so worried and scared, they should have made it beter."
"I am extreeeemely dissapointed n frustarted with my experience at St. Mary's Maternity Department. I visited the department for a routin antenatal check-up and it turnd out to be one of the worst experiences of my life.\n\nI was kept waiting for over two hours beyond my appointment time wif no explanation or apology given. The waitin area was overcrowded and it felt as if our health was secondaree to the hospital's adminstrative convenience.\n\nWhen I finally got a chance to see the doctor, he seemed hurried and uninterested in answerin my questions. Furthermor, the ultraswand technishun was verry rough and it was quite distressing for me.\n\nA medikal estabilishment such as the NHS ought to prioritise patient comfert and care, but this was sorely absint in my experience at St. Mary's. As a to-be mother, the stress caused was the last thing I needed and has shaken my trust in the hospital's maternity department care.\n\nI will be formally raising a complaint about this insident. I believe it is of utmost importance that the hospital reassess both its adminstrative effishensies and its staff's approach to patient communicaishun and care. Others should not have to suffer a similar ordeal."
"I recently had the unfortunut experience of visiting the Accidnet & Emergncie department at are local NHS hospital. I was really disaponted with the treatment recieved. I must say the compleet disregarded for cleenliness was not gud at all. Even though I told the staff about my week invune system, the room I was in had not been properily cleened. Also the staff handlings was also terible. \n\nI had big pain, and they made me wait for hours without any for of pain relief or evn paying any attenion to my situashun. The doctors and nurses were in a hurry and didn't seem to care about me ar my problam. \n\nAlso, when I did finaly see the doctor, they seemed like they didn't realy care, they spent hardly any time with me and rushed off to the next patint. I felt confussed and upset about my situashun, which they didn't address or explain to me propely. \n\nBased on this bad experiense, I have to complain. I will make an offical complain through the right channels so that no body else has to go threw what I did. They should never not take care and cleenliness, no matter how busy the department is."
"i vizited the Cardiology Departmnt at St. Mary's Hospital a fortnigt ago and im sorry to say but the level of care and comunication was shockingly inadequat. i waz diagnosed with an arritmia and was due for a follow-up\n\nupon arrival, the receptionist was on her personal fone call, forcin me to wait nereley 15 minutes before she even acknowledged my presecee. Following this, i was maid to wait anuther hour before a nurse could see me, despite my pre-scheduled appointment. \n\nthe doctor on duty rushed thru the consultation, barley paid attention to my questins or concerns. i left the appointment feelin more anxiety then before whitch is not condusiive for a person recovering from a hart issue.\n\nDishearteningly, the incompitence didnt end here. the farmacy filled my perscription incorrectly, whitch could of had serious dangerous implications for my health. Moreover, tryin to get hole of anyone to rectify this error was almost impossible. \n\nI truely believe i received sub-par care. Horifyd and disapointed by my experience, i fooly intend to raz a formal complaint bout the unacseptable standards of care and the potentual risks to patients safety. Patient care shout be a top priority, but my experience left me with the feelin that this is far from the truth at St. Mary's."
"I am very mad after my visit to the heart doctor at St Mary's Hospital. I went there four times in six months and again my problems were ignored. The service I got was bad. The doctor I saw did not take my chest pain and fast heartbeats seriously. They said it was just nerves, even though I complained before. I think it's fair to want my pain to be treated seriously. \n\nThe hospital was crowded and the nurses were too busy to handle all the patients. They also did not follow the Covid-19 rules in such an important department. My family was worried because of this and because they didn't clean enough. \n\nI waited long enough, now I want to tell the people in charge about the bad care I got. The hospital's bosses need to know how much the cardiology department is messing up and hurting patients."
"I am writin this reveew followin my vizit to the Accidint and Emerjancy departemnt at Queens Park Hospital last Tewsday. The car I receeved from the moment I walked in was disapointing, to say the least.\n\nLet me start by sayin that I undrstand the imense preshu the NHS is under, now more than ever. The staff are overworked and under stafd, and this pandemik iant helping either. But that doesnt discmiss the fact that I was traytd poorly or tht the services provided were subpar.\n\nI came in with extream abdominal pain and was left rithing in pain fowr hours bfore a doctor even saw me. The waiting room was overcraudid and there seemd to be no koncept of soceal distancin. i under stand that A&E departements are offten busy, but it was such an alrming sight given the current global circumstances.\n\nOnce a doctor finally tended to me, the examinashun was rushed, and I felt mor like a problem needing to be swifly dealt with rahther than a human being in pain. needlss to say, the diagoznostic test results were inconlusiv. Considring how hurried my tretment was, I_wasnt surprised.\n\nThe staff semed exxaperated and disinteristed. Not on helpeful or assurin word was addressed to me. Infact, a nus was borderlin rude when i requested some water, stating she waz too busy to fecth it. This is extrmely unsatissfactory - compashun and understanding should be core aspekts of patient car, epecially in a sitchuashion thats alredy stressfull.\n\nFollwoing my experience, I have decided to file a formal complaint against the A&E departemnt of Queen\u2019s Park Hospital. If at all sereous situashun arises in futture, i would rathar see myself travel an ekstra mile to another hospital than be treatid as if mearely an inconveniens at this one.\n\nTo any prospetiv patients readin this, I do urge you to considr my experience befor decyding to attend this department. Thair lack of EMPATHY and hasty treemt could pottentially lead to detremental health consequeces. Lets hope this reeview brings about some positive changs in thier functioning."
"I reasently had a distrissing experience at the Cardiologee Dept. at Westveiw Jenral Hopsital. There lack of professhunal interests and emathy tood patients leaves much to be disierd. I am not usually the kind to write such reveows, however, the deplorable handeling of my matters has pushed me to share my story with a genuin hope that other patients would not have to suffer the way I did.\n\nI had a schedule appointment for a standard ECG and echocardiogram. When I arived at the hopsital, the receptionist was not only confused about my appointment but seemed nether interested in helping to resolve the ishue nor concerned about the mounting anxeity this was causing me. Then, it took an extra our for them to find record of my appointment. The administratif ineffissacy was forder evydent when I had to repeat my medical history, which should have been readily avalebol in my patients rycords. \n\nThe technical staff conducting the ECG test was lackidisickle and inatenive, causing me physical discomfort during the test. When I voiced my distriss, rather than maniging the situation with compashun, I was met with condision and a dismisive attitude. This made my illness feel trivylised and neglicted.\n\nFollowing the concerning lack of professhunalissim demonstraded, I have decidid to raize a formal complaint against the departmint. I belive this to be neccissary to prevent other patients from receiving similar substandard care. I am truly appede with the Cardiologee Dept's conduct. The medecal practis is not merely about diagnosiss and tretement, but also about caring and e"
"I feel obligatid to share my dissapointing experience at the Royal Victoria Infirmary's Gynaecology Department to raise awareness and hopefully start change. I had an appointment sechuled for a routine check-up, which I anticapated to be straitforward, but from the moment I walked into the department, I had an awfully unprofessional experience. \n\nThe waiting area was visibl unclean \u2014 there were empty coffe cups and torn magazine pagers on many of the chairs. It was an unwelcome site, especially during these times when cleenliness and hygiene are paramount. But what was more apalling was the level of disrespect I encountered from the staff.\n\nThe receptionist at the front desk seemd uninterested and distracted, providing me with brief and curt responses. I wasn't given any clear instructions or told how long I would have to wait. And the wait was indeed long \u2014 over two and a half hours past my confrmed appointment time \u2014 before I was finally called in by a doctor who seemed perplexed why I was there and quite indifferent about my overall wellbein.\n\nExplaing my medical history, the doctor interruppted me a few times, not allowing me to express my concerns fully. It felt like they just wanted to see the back of me and move onto the next patient. I felt rushed, ignored and completely invalided, which is not something anyone should experience, especially in a healthcare setting.\n\nDespite my disapointment, I remaind patient, but when my scheduled tests were completly forgottin and I had to reminde the medical team, that was the final straw. Recieving inadequate medical care at such a critikal place, where patients' wellbeing should be prioritissd, has led me to question the trustworthiness of the hospital.\n\nI have escaleted these matters by formaly submitting a complaint to the patiant services department against the Gynaecology Department and its staff's unprofessional conduct. It's certainly not what I, or any other patient, should go through. I hope my coments will inspire a full review and,as a result, improvement of their patiant care."
"I am made so downcast by the  sheere disapointment with the sevice I received on my risent vist to the Endocrinology Deparment at St. Albans hosptial. I had not high hopes from the start, but even those were to high. It seems my experance was anything but good.\n\nI was there about my bad thyroid heath, hopen to find help. But the people working there amazed me. The recptionist was so busy, she didn't even look at me as I give her my appointment slip.\n\nThe doctor who saw me was a savge beast. He cared not about my inners, may be becase he had too many people to see that day. He was with me for only fiftee minutes. He quickly told me what madicine to take without thinking about how ill I was. He spoke so little to me, and didn't examine me. He had no consiring, which was so sad.\n\nFurther, they didn't make it clear about my new madicone, so now I have no idea. It looked like they didn't care about my health, they only cared about finishing on time, like I was just a nuber.\n\nBecause of this bad vist, I will be raise a formal complaint again the Deparment. I am not happy at all with how they treat people. They should care about us and be profesional. It is such a shame they didn't. \n\nThey need to make huge changes, it isn't just a little improvement needed. People should stay away from this Deparment for the completely fules way they work."
"I recently had a brufing verry distresing experiens at the Durham Genaral Hospital's fomance dapartment. I was there for a normal CT scan and the lac of good work by the staff was hart braking. From the moment I walk in, I was greated with a unkarin ah-ti-tewd like I was a nusence insted of a sick person. The newsechent didt even bother looking at me when I came in. The prsone trying to take my pichures looked like they wated to finish asap. They di not give me good detales abowt what they wear doin.  Kwetching to the bad dokter di not do eni thing cos she didt bother listen or cair. Ill make a complent to the hidperson purson abut the bad servis I got. This ype of bad bheVir teowrds us guys who are sik is not good. We need medsen care and paytion good. Sadly, the people in the Durham Genaral hospital dont give dir xtra metion on this things."
"I had an incredebly unfortun8 experience at the Riverdale Orthopaedics Depthsment last week. The waiting times were way longer than I had been initially told. I arrived at 10 am for my apointment, and didnt get seen until 3 pm - 5 full hours of waiting. Whats more woryn is that none of the staff seemed bothered or apologetik about the massiv delay. Nobody even bothered to up8 me or other patients about wen we might be seen. \n\nWhen I finaly did get to c a doctor, the consult8shun was rushed and I felt like I did not get a chance to fully discus my concerns about the arfritis in my knee. The doctor seemed dismisl, brushing off my questions about future treatment opsions. \n\nThe cherry on top was wen I asked to lodj a complaint about my experience, the receptionist was not able to guide me properly thru the process. It felt as if they were purposely making it more difficult for me. \n\nIm going to be discussing this further with my GP and I fully intend on raising a formal complaint with the NHS. Its unexcep8ble for patients to be treated like this, especially wen they are suffering from ongoing, debilitating conditions. I hope nobody els has to go thru a similar experience."
"I wsh I could right something positive about my recent Xperience at da general surjery department of St. Anderson's Hospital, but tht unfortunately seems imposible.\n\nMy aplomint, originaly shuduhlded for 8:30 AM, took place at 11:30 AM. Givn that I arived 10 minits eearly, as suggedted, I had to wait for thre long hours. Durring my wate, I was not given any form of explanashun or apollogy for da delay. Such neglajunce in managing aplomints is unaxceptable.\n\nOnce I finally met the dokter, they seemed disintressed and rushed. They gav very brief answers to my serios health cores and shied away from xplaining da possible side fects of my treatment. For someone dealin with a potentially life-changin condition, such indiferens is distrissing to say the leest.\n\nDespite multipul attempts to communikate my concerns to da hospital's manajemint, they have fallen on daf ears. In such a scenario, the only option left for me is to raiz a formel complant to sek redres for da dire service I reseived.\n\nThe negativ impacts of such poor practise on patients\u2019 well-bein can't be overlok'd, and I expeckt imediat akshun from the responsibul authoreties."
"I recentlly had a horribel expereince at Calidonia Jenoral Hospital's Endrokinolijy Deperement. The lack of comunikation was beyond anythin I have ever experinced. My oppintment was reschedueled twise without notice - i only found out when i called to confirm the time. When i finaly got an oppintment, i arrived to find out my doctor wasnt availible.\n\nThe consultation with the replacement physicin was a nitemare. He didnt look at my previous medical records and seemed absolutly uninteresed in my symptoms. He then sujested a treatmen plan that was identicly what id done befor with no succes. It was frustratingly evident he was not familiuar with my case history.\n\nI have a complex thirod condition and such neglijence could have serious helth inmplikashuns for me. The administrtion staff wer equally unhelplful, offering no solushuns, just throwing around excuses. It feels as though 'patients' are given scant respekt or concern, and this is highly unprofesional. Watever happend to patient care bein the pryority?\n\nI have filed a formal complaint over the lack of comunikation and the sheer inaduqacy of the serfise i received. This isnt jist about poor customer serfise, but about a cruucchal helthc;re prudivion. I hope no one els has to experinse such reklez treemint at the hands of thsoe who are suposed to pryoritize patient welfere."
"I recently had an experience at the Orthopaedic Wing of the City Hospitol and, to be honest, it wos a nightmeaar from start to finish. The time it has taken from my initiaal consoltashon to surjery is apauling and quite frankley, unacceptabel.\n\nI want to focus speesifically on the burocratic and administrativ isuus that played my hole jurny. I first viseted the Orthopaedic department back in Januari, and it took three months of fone calls before I cud lock in a date for my knee surjery. Severe miskomoonication and lost paperwork resulted in a whirlwind of inconviehense. I found myself constantly having to re-explane my situation to diffrent staf members wich was frustraiting and exhausting.\n\nI finally underwent surjery in April, only to discover that my follow-up appointment had been misplased and double boocked. When I arived fo the appointment, there was no record of it and I was asked to come on a different day. This gross neglek and ineffishency with my case has seriously impacted my recuvry and extended sick leave from my job.\n\nThe tangabel lack of coordinashon and a seemingly indiferent aatitud is deeply concerning. I didn't feel valuen as a patient at all. I understud that hospitols are stretched, but there shud never be excuse for such poor service and desorganizashon.\n\nI have been left with no choyse but to raise a fomal complaint abowt my experiences at City Hospitol's Orthopaedic department. Care must be taken to improve the administrativ aspekts and humanise patient interashons. Without these necessery improvments, I feer the quality of service and patient outcoms willcontinu to teeter on the edge of inadequasy."
"im proper dissapointed wid my recent experience at the blackburn royal hospital, specially in the radiconology department. my apointmint was for 9am, an i was told to get there early in case theres any delaying. i got there at 8:45, an then they made me wait til 10:45 just to tell me they was behind with apointments.\n\nthat aint even the worst part, the problem is how they delt with the situation. i aint been kept updated or told anything about the delay. they aint even talking to me about it! the staffs attitude was well dodgy on this occassion. i could only just make out a bit of understanding an respect for us patients who was left feeling all unsure an uncomfortable for bare time.\n\nwhen i finally had my scan, they was treating me like a rush job. the radiomigrafist was acting all impatient an like they didnt even care. their hastey behaviour made me feel well awkward, like i was causing them bare hassle. \n\nthis whole thing was well personal, an it left me well upset. being on time, comms, an showing concern for patients is what makes a hospital good, but they proper slacked on all of it when i went. im defo gunna complain about the rubbish way they acted an the unnecessary delay i was put through.\n\nthe hospital needs to seriously think about how they treat their patients, instead of muggin them off like they dont matter. the NHS is summat we all rely on, so we dereves to be treated wiv proper care an concern. proper rubbish experience, they let me down big time."
"im reali dissapointed wiv the servises at St. Albans Hospital, espeshaly the Gynaecology Department. from the moment i stepd into the department to the time i left, all i xperienced was inefishency, no regard for patients and rudnes.\n\nOn my inishal vist, i had to wait for ova an hour past my appointment time, langwishin in anxiety wivout any explenation or apologis. wen i finally saw the specialist, they wos rushd, dismissive, and, frankly speakin, appearD underprepard. they seemd to lack vital infomation relatein to my health in spyt of my GP havin sent all my medical records in advance. i felt as tho my health concerns were not bein takein serious and wos left feelin confusd and anxious after the consultashun.\n\nBut the final straw come wen i tried to schedul a follow-up appointmen. the recepshunist wos incredibely short and seemd to lack basic patient-prosedeure noledge. it wos frustratin and i felt neeglected wiv my concerns lannin on deaf earz. i had to make multiple calls and visets to the hospital jus to schedul one appointmen.\n\nInregard to this, i hav alredy started forml procedins to file a complant about the ill treetment i xperienced in this department. it is unaceptabul, espeshaly wen dealin wiv such sensitive medical isues.\n\ni beleeve that healthcare shud be compassionate and patient-focused. unfortunatley, my xperience wiv the Gynaecology Department at St. Albans Hospital wos anythin but, and im sure im not the only one who feelz this way. this wos a dismal xperience and one i wish on no one else. The hospital seeriusly needz to scrutynize and change the way they handle patients."
"I recently visited the Gastroenterology deportment at St. Mary's Hospital for an endoscopy session. It is wiv disappointment an frustration that I rite this review. My appointment which was scheduled for 11:00 am, did not start until around 1:30 in the afternoon. No staff member had the courtesy to inform us of the delay or offer signficant apologies.\n\nOnce I got into the procedure room, things went from bad to worse. The doctor appeared hurried an seemed to brush off my questions. I felt like an inconvenience rather than a patient in need of care. A nurse, who seemed distracted an aloof, administered the sedation. It seemed alarmingly fast an insufficiently controlled, which heightened my anxiety even further.\n\nAfter the procedure, no one spent time explaining the outcomes or next steps to me thoroughly. I felt in the dark an somewhat fearful about what could happen next.\n\nThe lack of communication, attention to patients' needs an humanity were quite striking. I believe that everyone deserves dignity an respect, in addition to professional medical care. During my visit, I felt like a number, a tickbox on a long list of daily jobs, rather than a person.\n\nNow I feel compelled to officially submit a formal complaint to the NHS about my experience. I cannot imagine going through another preparation for a difficult procedure like this, just to be treated so poorly. This experience certainly erodes my trust in the hospital system an in St. Mary's Hospital in particular. I sincerely hope that no other patient has to undergo the same experience I have. I expect better care an more respect from a public health service."
"I recntly visted the A&E department at St. Gorge's hospital due to a serius hedache. Whyle the permisis were kept impeccibly clen, I found the waiting time extreemly long. The staff, tho under pressure, maintaned a profesionl demenr throughout. However, wot dispointed me was the lak of comunication; I was uninformed about the delay, causing anxiety an uncertainty. Having raised the matter with a nurce, I didn't get a satisfactry response. I'm planing on filing a formal complant reguarding this comunication isyou. Overal, my xperrince was a mixd bag, appreciating the clenliness and decarum but let down by the lak of transparciny in patient management."
"i recently went to the ear nose and ferot department of our local hospital. while the hosptal was clean and the stuff were nice, i was upset with the long waiting times. i was left waiting for near an hour past my scheduled appointment time. i no busy things can get, but a bit more clearness would've been nice. its sad, especially when you've things to do and places to be. i have since put in a offical complaint as i believe this could be done better in the future. otherwise, the care provided was ok."
"I had my outpashent appointmant at st gorge's cardiolagee depaertment. Altho the meedical car i recivd was ok, the delay in appointmet timz wuz quite big. I undastand that hosptals can get busy, but som propr tiem managment should be implemnted. I hav wated an ekses of too hours on several ocasions, cuzing major disruptun to my daiely life. I am seriosly concidering raizing a formmal complant if the situaishon duseent impruv. The staff iz kind and attentiv, but the effishency of teh sistem rly neds adressng."
"after havin' an outpatient appointment at the Queen's Park Orthopaedic Unit, i can't say i had the best experience. the staff were nice 'nough, but their timing was pretty bad. my appintment was delayed by over an hour and there wasnt much talkin' 'bout why this was 'appening. also, once i was seen, my consultation felt all rushed up. i've gone 'n complained 'bout these things. it's sad 'cause ya always think a top hospital department would take better care 'n be more organised."
"I vizited the Orthopaedics Deperment at our local hospital last Monday following a referal due to a knee injury. The location was easy to find, well sined and the resepcion staff were generally polite. My acshul encaunter with the medikul professionals, however, left something to be desired.\n\nI was seen by a doctor who semed preoccupied and not fully attentive to my concerns about my injury. They semed rushed and I felt like I wasn't given the time requyred to fully diskuss my simptums. My inicial konsultation felt hasty and incomplete, witch left me feeling somwhat uneasy and neglected.\n\nIn adition, during my routin bllod tests, the nurse struggled to find a vein and rezulted to multipul atempts. I was left with substantial brusing and felt the nurse lacked experience and tact.\n\nI am therefore having reserbations about my forthcuming treatment plan and have made a decision to lodge a formal complaint about my inicial konsultation. I am undoubtedly thankful we have the NHS and all the hard-working staff however this experyence has unfortunatly left me feeling apprehensiv about the quality of care I am set to recieve. \n\nIt is only fair for higher standards to be maintained to ensure patients trust and confidence. This opinion is basd soly on my personal experyence and I truely hope it doesnt represnt the experyence of many."
"I wesh to shar my recent experience with the Oncology Deparment at St. Johns Hopsital. The team showed commendabel efforts wen handling my dokteris and treatment plan, promiding a resonably wholestik servis. I, however, have a rezervation.\n\nMy tritment seshions wer scheduled efficientley and follow-ups were prompt. However, there was a concarning lack of emotional support and patiant-focussed care, sumthing that the hospitul generaly prids itself on. The nurses wer always swapmed and they appered more task-focussed rathur than patiant-centred. As a patiant dealing with a serious dokteris, I felt this lack of emotional support added an unnecessary burdin.\n\nRisently, I have also experiencd issuws with uhtaining complite informashun regarding my test risults. Wile I was informd that my risults wer reddy, no one was availabel to explein them to me in detail - and that left me feeling unesy and anxious. Having a clere understanding of one's own health situashun is crucial and it shudn't be taken litely.\n\nAltho the medical handling of my case was relatively well-managed, the emotional chalenjes I facd du to the lack of support and the non-transparency reguarding my test risults is disapointing. Hence, I feel required to formally rais a complent to rightly edress these issuws.\n\nIn conclusion, ther is rum for improovement in patiant comunicaashuns and emocional support - which I belive are just as essenstial as the medical tritment itself."
"My most recent visit to the A&E department at the Redding Medical Centre was good overall, but had one big problem that needs to be fixed. \n\nWhen I got there, they took me in right away because I needed help urgently. The nurses were fast, professional, and mostly nice. Even though they had a lot to do, they took the time to make me feel better and help me with my bad situation. I really appreciate that.\n\nThe problem was with Dr Bateman, who was my doctor that day. He was kind of rude when he talked to me, like I was just a bother and not someone who needed help. That made everything worse, because I was already hurting and feeling bad.\n\nAlso, he didn't explain the treatment options clearly, so I got even more confused and lost. I complained about how he acted, because everyone deserves to be treated nicely and told the truth when they're in a bad position.\n\nBut most of the other people there, like the people at the front desk, the nurses, and the other workers who aren't doctors, were really good. I would think about going back because of them, but I would tell other people to make sure they get a good explanation about their treatment. It's sad that one person who didn't talk nicely and care about others could make it hard for a team that worked really hard to help people."
"I recentlee had a schedueled appointment at St Mary's Hospitls Radology department. The navagation signs in the hospital was quite clear, and I able to easiley find the depatmise t on the seckond floor. The waiting area was cleen and well-kept, with a televishin an currint magizne's wich made the waiting morage belabl.\n\nMy appointed time was for 10:30 AM, howevr, I was not taken back untill 11:15 AM without any explanaton for the delay. I appreiate that heathcare profeshnls can get occupide with worklod, but an update bout delays would of been appreeshiatid.\n\nWhen I was finelly seen, the radiografer was professhunle and caried out the prucidure quikley. Sadley, the results wasn't clearly xplained to me. I felt rusht through the process, and when I had questions, they was not met with the pashuns and detalled responces I expected. It gave me a feeling of not being entierly aware about my health condishun.\n\nI have decidded to maek a formel compplaint about this. No matter how buzy the department is, effektive communicashun is key in medical procedurs to make pashent feel comfortable and invovl. Hers hopeing my complane leads to improvved pashent treatmnt an comunicashun in the future."
"My mother rekently had a stratk and was taken to the Ryal Marsten Hopsital's Nedroloj Department. Dhe process of getin her admited was effishent, though in hyndsight, I found the hole insident extremele overwhelming at the time. The nors on duty, Hellen, was very reasuring, explained that she had handled simmilar cases meny times before. She put are minds at eeze to a setain extent, givin the severity of the situation.\n\nThe Nedroloj department itself was bothe clean and adekwetly maintaned. The corridors were brite, and the wards were hyginicaly clean \u2013 a comfortin site, considerin the state my mind was in. I found the seting in the waitin erea to be quite comfertble, which helped as we had to spen quite a lot of time waiting for test results and the docter's assessment.\n\nThe only negatifs I had with the treatment at the Nedroloj Department stemmed from are interaction with one of the docters. While the doctre was evidenly nolejabel in his feeld and inforamtive about the situation, he appeared to be overworked and had a sort of rudy and dismissive mantor. This certainty didn't help the destresed status that we were allredy in. His unability to respond to are causters with payshents seamed unocseptable to me. In one instens, he even rased his voice slighly when my mother missunderstud a question he asked.\n\nGiven the seriosness of my mother's condishon, I felt that we diservd a more payshent and understanding treatment. I atempted to rase this as a formel complant throgh the apropriate hopsital chanels but, as of yet, have not been suseafull in navagaiting the somewhat confusin process.\n\nIn conculsion, I would like to expres that the functionin of the Nedroloj department, in general, is commedable. The efforts of the majorety of the staf, especily the norses, in ensurin are relatife comfert doring a stresful time is truly apresiated. However, even a singel negative ineraction mars the otterwize high standard of servise, and I hope the ishew is promptley adresed. I'd advis fucher pashents and there famillees to prepere for the posibility of mixd experiences regarden how there treated."
"I would like too take this opurtunity to offer my revew of my recent vist too the Endocrinology Deprtment at Cunty General Hosptal. The vist was primarily too monitor progress after a diagnoiss of a thyrod dusorder. Check-in was efficently handlled, with minimul wate time, thanks too a wll-organnised admineestretive teem. The department's faclities were imaculate; cleerly, gd hygeine is a hi pryority here. My examinashun room exhbited the same level of cleness.\n\nHowever, sum conserns arroze during the consultayshun process wich, in my view, affected the overall qulty of care. While the nersing staff ware frendly and profesional, the Consulatnt Endocrinologis's mnnr left quite a bit two be desired. His dissmisiv tone and lack of patienc wen answring my qestions about my condition ware unsettling. I was made too feel as if my queres ware a nusnc even, rather than part ov my proses of understanding my helth.\n\nDespite his vast eeksperience and mdcil knolege, wich i do not dispute, the consultant's inabilitee too communicate efecctivly tarnished the otherwise posative impressions of the department. It's important for such key personnel too be empthetic and patint, wich, i this case, was lacking.\n\nGiven the cercumstances, i feel compellled two rais a formal complent in the hope that improvment in this arrya can be prompted. My intsnt isn't too provid a punitiv meassure against the consultant. Rther, it's an opurtunty two highlght the esential natre of efecctive patient commuinication in fosterin trust, respect, and ultimatly, patient satisfction. My hope is that thru this prosses, the Consultant may receive the necessary trainin or support too enhans his patient intrraction skulls.\n\nOveral, my exprience with the Endocrinology Deprtment at Cunty General Hosptal was a mixd won. If askd, i cudnt recomend this department without reserfasions due to this expearince. Nonethless, i would like too thank the ancillary staff, whose profesionlism and frendliness waren't dede comendble, and who make a sigificnt diferens too patients like myself each day."
"My latest vizit to the Edgeworth General Hospital's Department of Radiology was a mixd experience. I would like to commend the team for their profeshonal approach and seeminly effortless efficiency, particularly the front desk staff who displaid commendable empathy in adressin concerns of all patients in the waitin room. The stait-of-the-art equipment is credit to the hospital's commitment to providin quality healthcare services. \n\nOne area where this vizit was less satisfactory revolved around the appointment schedulin and delays. The manner in which my appointment was handled was quite frustratin. I had booked a 10 a.m. slot for an ultrasund scan but by 11.15 a.m., I hadn\u2019t yet been attnded to. Whilst I understand that sumtimes appointments may be delayed due to unforeseen reasons, it would have been nice to receive an estimate on the wait time, or indeed any communication about the delay at all. \n\nThe most concernin part of this experience, however, was observin an elderly man in the waitin area who seemed to be forgotten about entirely. He had been waiting for his X-ray and growing visibly distrest, yet nobdy in the department provided him any assurances or updates. I believe it's essential to regularly communicate with patients, even more so in the case of elderly, who may find hospitals a little more overwhelmin.\n\nFollowing this incident, I feel compelled to raise a formal complaint to brin about necessary improvements in appointment schedulin and patient communication. While it's essential to have a high standard of medical excellence, it's equally important, if not more so, to practis clear and compassionate communication. Patients' time is valuable too, and spendin hours in a waitin room can notably reduce their overall satisfaction with the services provided.\n\nThis was an unfortunate incident that marred what could have been a pleasant vizit to the health facility. I hope that followin my feedback, the department will review their procedures and improve their service quality. In spite of this, I intend to continue usin the hospital's services in the hope that continual feedback contributs to better processes for all patients."
"I vistidd the Orthopdetics Depatmnt at St Jams's Uniervsity Hsopital a fyew weeks back for a much anticiptd knee replacement sugery. I was qite apprehansive concdring the magmtitude of the sugery but was relived by the deteld acount of the procedre that was explaind by the consulting sirgeon durng my pre-surgery consoltations.\n\nHowever, I was surprisd on the day of the sugery to be intrduced to a completly differnt sirgeon who was to perform the operatoin. I had mentaly prepart myslef to hav Dr McCrthy, with woom I had prevously consutld, condct the sugergery. The suden change in surgeon wit no prior notis creaed unnecessary anxiery and apprehnsion. I belev that continuty of cre is importnt and this chang felt disruptve.\n\nSeconly, the post-opertive cre was also not up to my expecations. The staff was stetched and seamed rushd at all tmes, whch made me feel like an intrusion rather than a ptient recuiring help and cre. Pain managment was not adequately addressd and there were prolongd waiting times for medication.\n\nIn light of these isuest, I feel complld to rasie a formrl compant. I belev the hsopital shoud communicte any chenges in the medicl staff in advnce and trat it as a crucial part of tratmnt plnning. I hope that this incdent will leed to a revuwe of hospital polces conerning staff communication and ptient care. \n\nTo end on a possitive note, I would like to menchion that the fsyotherpy tem was wunderful and made me feel cmfortable and motivaed durng the recovery phse. They were attentve, profesionl and soportive throughot. \n\nOvrall, the services delivered by the Orthopdetics Depgatment at St Jams's Uniervsity Hsopital were satisftory, albeiet disapointing at a fyew stages. I hope that my fedbck will be taken on bord and any nesesary improvemets made to enhnce the ovrall patint eperience in the future."
"I rezintly vizited the AE department at owr local ospital followin a mina accedent at ome. The experience was a mixd one.

"i woz recently a patient at the citty General Hospital Orthopaedics Dept. Mi treetment lardy involved consulsations over a period of munths leading up to a hip replasement surgery. To their kredit the staf handled the number of patients quite desently, managing the human trafik in an efficient manner. Mi major concern, however, revolved around lack of thorough communication regarding mi care plan. i felt as tho the surgeons and consults didn't provide enuf detailed info about the progression of mi case, leeving me somewhat unsertain.\n\ni must say mi surgery went well and i commind the expertise of the surgeons. Their skillset is not in kweshun hear. The fisyotheerapy team were also wunderful, very patient, and empathetic. they reely made mi recovery more manageabel with their encourajment and clear instruckshuns.\n\nstill, the comnukashun ishu persisted even post-surgery, i woz handed off to various members of staff which mayd me feel more like an item in a production line than a patient in their care.\n\ni have raisd a fornmal complaent with the Patient advise and liasion servis (pals) regarding the comnukashun aspect of mi care. it is mi hope that they address this ishu in order to optimise patient care.

"I rezently atended the cardoleje depardment at S. Peter's Hopsital for a routin angiomram. The recption staff wer polite and welcomd me on awwival. The start of the precdure wen fine, and the nurcing staff wer professional and expalned the proces step by step in a clear mannner which helpd to as my nerves.\n\nHowerver, my main cncern arised during the recovry fase. I stayd for aroun 5 hours in a small word havving to share one bathroom betwean a nfumber of pashents which did not seem ok in terms of privacey and hygiene, espeshially in thse COVID-19 times. I understand that resorces can somtimes be crampd, but I would have apriciated a cleener and more privet rest space.\n\nThe thing that bothered me the most was that I experinced sevare chest pain durin this recovry perid. Despight pressing the nurce call buton twice, it took neerly 20 minuts for a nurs to attend to me. I believ this delay in responce time was unaceptable and can potentally have serious consiquences in a cardiology unit.\n\nI do apprciate the efforts of the staff and the complexity involved in their work, but I feel I must rasie a formmal complaint regading the dalays in patint care and the lack of adquit privacy and clenliness in the recovry ward. Whil the hospitol ovral offers good service, these particular areas need reconsedration and imrovement."
"My visit 2 the radiology department @ St. George's Hospital was not like I thought. When I got there, it wasn't too hard 2 find my way in the hospital. The signs were easy 2 understand, and the hospital was nice and clean. But then, when we made it to the radiology department, things started to go wrong.\n\nThe appointment itself was messed up. Even though I had an appointment, I had to wait for an hour before I could go in. I know that delays can happen, but they didn't tell me what was going on.\n\nAlso, the staff seemed really stressed out, and they showed it when they talked to me and other patients. One time, the person doing my tests was rough and made me uncomfortable. I know the NHS staff have a lot of work to do, but they shouldn't let it affect how they treat patients.\n\nI'm not trying to complain, but I want to say that there is a lot of things that need to be better. Going to the hospital is already stressful, and experiences like this make it even worse. I hope the department does something to make sure the service is better for all the patients."
"I flat went on an appointment at the X-Ray Depot of my local NHS hospitel. I got an ultra-sound as part of a diagnose thingy to make out the cause of my bely pain. The hospitel is clean an well sinposted; I had no issues to find the place. The people at the desk were nise when I got there, which helped coz I was a little bit woried at first.\n\nMy ultra-sound was done by a rayo-logist and their helper. While I get that it's a hard job and not always nice for the workers, I felt like they coulda done more to make me feel better during the thing, cuz I was real nervous, ya know, coz it was my first time.\n\nAlso, when they was doing the ultra-sound, the rayo-logist and their helper was talking bout personal stuff, and I didn't like that at all. It made me even more nervous and uncomfortable lying there on the table. I reckon they shouldn't a been chatting like that, espeshly coz it was a private-type thing, and it made the care not so good.\n\nI've decided to make a proper complant bout the way the rayo-logist and their helper acted, cuz it messed up my ultra-sound experience lots. I hope they do something bout it so no one else has to go through the same thing in the future.\n\nTo be fair, the whole experience at the hospitel was alright. The place to sit and wait was comfy, and I was seen pretty close to my appointment time, which was good. The results of the ultra-sound was explained to me fine when I had my follow-up talk, which was nice and proper. The only thing that could be better was how the people treated me during the thing itself. Overall, I reckon it was so-so, nothing super amazing."

"My experiance at the Hartlans Genaral Surgery Unet was on the hole a mixd bagg. I went in for a mener prosedure and I must say that the stuff there did a realy good job. They told me evreything abot the prosedure and made sure I undestood the posibble problems. After that evreything went smothey with my recovrey and I didn't have to much pane. The people there were very nice and made sure I was comfterble durin my sstay.\n\nBut one thing that i didnt like was the adninistrative site. I had trubles getin my surgery schedualed and then when they reschedualed it three times they didnt explane why. They just said it was becas they had to many people already.\n\nBut the worst part was when I was getin discharged. The people at the desk gav me a wrong invoice and they charged me twice the amount of monney. They were billing me for things that I didn' even get. It took me a long time and a lot of talking to people before they fixd it.\n\nI think that the hospital can do beter. They should get things right. I'm thinking about making a complant to make them make things beter for other people. Even though the surgery was good, the hospital didn't do a good job with the administrative stuff and they were not nice to me."
"I found the Ortwopeedik Diparment at The Royal Hospittle to be a mixt bag, honetly. On one hand, the quality of treatment that they offered was good. I was dealing with a serius leg injury and their strick and focused recevery plan helped me to swiftly regain mobulity. The weekley chekc-ups ensured a smooth transishun and I must commned the fizziotherepists for their expertese and reponciveness.\n\nUnfortonately, the administwation aspect of the hospittle was disapointing. On a few ocasinos, there was a lack of commuicashun between members of the administritive staff and this caused numerous ishoos with my oppoinments. At one stage, I was given an oppoinment for a date when the speshalist assigned to me was not available. It resulted in an unnecesary visit, wasted time and quit a bit of frustrashun.\n\nMost disconserting of all was an incident where I found that my medicul reports were not available for my consoltashun due to an in-house clerical eror. This disrupted the continwity of my treatment and delayed my pregress, as vital information about my rehabilitation was not immedeatly available.\n\nMy bigest concern is their careless handeling of patient's dawkuments. A mix-up in the allocashun of medicul files led to some of my privit informashun being disclosed to another patient. As a result, I intend to rase a formal complaint regarding this matter. Pryvacy is paramount, particularily in a healthcare seting so I'm hoping this will prompt necesary chaynges.\n\nAll things considired, while the Ortwo peedik team did their work well, somewhat tarnished was my experience by administrative ishoos. I feel there is a need for The Royal Hospital to look into refining their administrative practises for a smother and more relable service."
"I am so so cross and reel reel angry about my nufink but good for nuffink time at the Kardiology bit of the posh hospital. They dint even do nofink proppa and one of them nurses was proper nasty, I tell ya. When I was getting the test, she said sumfing well mean bout me being not good wiv pain coz I ain't like 'er. That made me feel well sad and there's no way I'm going back there again. It's well out of order for people to be racist in places where they're supposed to help sick people. Someone's gotta get in a lot of truble for this."
"I wis I culd giv zero stars to the Orthopaediks Department at St. John'z Hospital. Durin my recent visit, one of the nurses made blatently racist commentz about my background. After overhearin me speakin in my native langwage, she made remarkz about me \"probably not even understandin English.\" It felt lik a direct attack, and I waz apauled that such behaviur cud b overlooked in a profesional settin. The incident wuz upsetting an left me feelin alienated. Ther's absolutly no excuse for such diskriminative behaviur. I demand corrective action b takn."
"Iv never experinced such an hurandous lack of care and professionlism as I did at Stonehill A&E last weekend. The nuurse that initually helpd me made a blantantly rasic remark about my ethnicitee, completly unpervoked. I was in intene pain and in dire need of care, but I felt demeand and disrespected insted. Its shocking that racisism can so opnly exist within the NHS. I am extremly dissapointed and shaken up by this insident. I would strongly advize others to be cautios about seking medical help from this departmint."
"I'm appalled by the apralin behaver I encountered at St. L-- hospital, espesally within the A&E place. I was treated not just with general indife-- but also seened meaningful, races remarks sexcident towards a fellow person by 1 nurse named Carol. Such behaver should have no playc in an place aiming to heal and take care. Your stef's lack of empoty and openly prejudice are inlie unacceptible. This experens was deeply distressing. Urgent akson needs to be t--- to adress this."
"I am appoled and deeply sadned by the treatmint I reseaved at the Bradfurd Genrul Hospital, specefikly in the radiology departmant.

From the moment I arrive, one staf member in partiKular, whose name I will not diskrise here, showed a clear lack of respekt and profesonalism.\n\nAs staf were prepering me for the scan, this indiveedual made a hily inoprupriate remark about my whelchair, insinuating that I was 'luky' to have it, allowing me to 'skip ques and get the best parking spots.' This was not only kondoning but outrite ablist, something which I did not ekspekt to inkounter in the NHS, an instetution that shud treet everyone ekwoly, regardless of thair disabilitees.\n\nThe entyre ekspirienK left me feeling shoked, upset, and incredibly drowt. A hospital is a plase where I shud feel kared for, not beleteled. The attitood and beehaver displaed by this staf member was holey unaxepptabel and it impacts on the ovroll patient eksperience. I hope ekshon is tayken to enshur no other patient hass to inkounter this form of diskriminashon in futur."
"I reescently visited the Orthopaedic Department at St. Mary's Hospital and I am apaled by the behaviur I experienced there. After suferring a fall and being referd by my GP, I was hopefull that I would receive profeshunal care. However, my hopes were shattered due to a devastaiting encounter with a member of staff.\n\nAs a wheelchair user, I am acutely awere of how differentli sum people tend to treat me, however I had never expected such iggnorant behaviur in a healthcare setting. During my consultaion, the consulant not only ignored my complaints of pain, but also made distateful, ableist comments that I found incredibly unproffeshunal and upsetting. He said, \"If you could walk, you wouldn't be in this pain\". This communt was deeply hurtful and ensensitive.\n\nHis words implied that my disability was not serious enough, invelidating my suffering. Such casual discrimation can have a profound impact on a patien's experience; it made me feel underminded and ridiculed in a setting where I expected empaty and understanding. This incident has immensely affected my trust in the system.\n\nI am not just a wheelchair user. I am a patien who needs medikal attenshun, respec, and understanding. It's shamful that a healthcare profesional actid with such disregar. I hope the hospitul takes prompt actiun to adress this isue to prevent eny similar experiences in the futur. I certainly wouldn't recommend the Orthopaedic Department at St. Mary's Hospital after today's disgrayful encounter."
"I'm honestly appalled an saddened to report my recent experience at the Serenity Meadows Emergency Department. I'd been experiencing bad pain in my tummy and went in thinking to get some relief and answers. \n\nWhen I was finally checked in, the nurse on duty was really mean about my pain, like they didn't believe me and thought I was just making it up for attention. But even worse was the mean stuff Dr. Harper said when he saw me. He made an improper joke about my Asian background, asking if I had \"eaten too much sushi\" to give me this pain. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it was like a really bad stereotype, which you should never have in a hospital.\n\nThe whole thing was very upsetting, and I left the hospital feeling worse than when I came in. It\u2019s really creepy to have such unprofessional people in a place supposed to make you better. You go to a hospital wanting them to show kindness, understanding, and to treat everyone equal. Sadly, the workers at Serenity Meadows Emergency Department need to learn how to be nice to people from different backgrounds.\n\nBeing called Serenity Meadows Emergency Department is a joke because they didn't give me peace or respect like every patient deserves. I hope no one else has to go through what I did."

"I reget to write this but my receint visit to the Southton General Hospital's Internal Medicine department was an experiance akin to stepping bakwards in time, were respect and dignitiy were seemingly optional for some staff members. \n\nMy appointment was shceduled for the late afternoon, and I soon lerned that punctuality wasnt the department's strongest suit. I waited neerly an our past my scheduled time, the waiting room gradually emptying as other patients were called in. When it was finally my turn, I enterd, not knowing that my patience was to be further tested. \n\nThe doctor, who's name I wont mention, behavd in a manner that was very unsetling. He made derogeratory coments, akin to microagrressions, about my ethnicity, and seemd to use it as a reason for my helth status. He even jokd about langauge barrirs when there wasnt any. I speak fluent English and have been living in the UK for more than two decades. his actions were unacseptable and felt racist, to say the least.\n\nHe didnt just stop there. Scribbling down on his clipboard, he passiveley dismissd my concerns, attributing the symptoms I had been cperiencing to be something 'comman for my kind'. He stereotyped me using various assumptions and made me feel decididly out of place, uncomfortable, and undervalued.\n\nThe sence of uneese didnt end with just his racist remarks. When I tried to question his approach and express how belittled I felt, he dismised my feelings and went on to call me 'oversensitive'; a typical example of gasslighting. It was evident that he was not lissening to me as a patient and seemed completely unsympathetic to my discomfort. \n\nI left the hospital feeling humiliated, ignored, and unheard. These kinds of experiances can harm patients' trust in their healthcare providers, potentially discouraging them from seeking help when they need it. This is not acseptable behaviour for any professional, let alone someone in healthcare, where respect, understanding, and empathy should be of paramount importance.\n\nI implore Southton General Hospital to condect sensitivity training and hold their staff accountable for prejudiced behaviours. Just as physical alements are to be treated with professionalism and care, so too, patients' dignity and respect is indispensabel and must be maintained at all times."
"I'm writin this revew aftr a bad experians las week at the Acciddent and Emergancy Deppartment of the Royal Mead Hospital. I'm a patint and it made me very sad and upset that during such a tough time, I was treated very badly because of my race.\n\nI'm from Asia and when I got to the deppartment and went to the desk, the worker there said somthing rude in front of other patints. They said, \"I hope you're not bringing bad things with you.\" It was very bad and mean. They then put on gloves to touch my papers after they said that bad thing.\n\nThe bad thing they did made me feel bad, and it made the other patints feel bad too. It's very sad that even tho we are in the 21st senchury, racism is still a big problem, even in the helthcare system. What they said made me feel very scared to go to the hospital when I need help.\n\nI told someone higher up about what happend, but nothing has ben don about it. They havn't said sorry or done anything to fix the problem. Not doing anything about what happend is just as bad as the racism itsself.\n\nIn conclushun, the hospital is suposed to be a saf and cozy plaice for sick peopl. The workers are suposed to take care of us. Experiances like mine ruin this trust and make the helth service look bad. It's very bad to think that racism is okay anywher, but for it to be in the NHS, wich is suposed to be about helthcare for evryone, is very bad. We need to do somthing about racism and make the workers understand how to treat evryone in a good way."
"I recintly had a hard experience at the royal victora hospials orofopaedics department. I have always been someone who belives in the power of healthcar and the evolushun of medicine which is why this experiance left me deeply wounded and disgusted.\n\nMy sun, who is autistick, fractured his arm during a playgound insident and needed to be treated imediatly. After the initial faze of the emergencie room, we were handid over to the orofopaedics department. As tramitizing as the sitaution already was, the beheaviour of one of the staff members excerbaitid our plight.\n\na particular nurce showed a horably callas and ignorant beheaviour towards my sun. Istid of being sensitive about his condition and appliyng the necessary care routins, she demonstraitid blattent ableism. She began by making snid commints about how chalanging he was to treat, discossing it loud enough for us to hear. This stunned me but given the distriss my sun was in, i chose to ignor it.\n\nthinks took a torn for the wors when she insited on communicating with my sun directly, despite me highliting his difficulties with comunication due to autisem. She dismissed my coserns stating, \"I've seen plenty of thes kids, they're just stubborn and lashed out at him, even going to the extent of implying that he was actering and this was all theatrical.\"\n\nthis treatment was utterly appalig and inexcusable. this sheer lack of understanding and the judgemental beheaviour towards my sun is something that one dos not expect from a professional at an esteemed inshtutin like the nhs. the lack of empathy coupled with the verbabl abuse left us in chock.\n\nits utterly unfartunate that such insidents continue to persit and reflect gross descraminashun. i belive the hospital and nhs must take imediate akshun against such explicit ableism and lack of emotinal intelligence in their staff. this tarnishes the repitation of the meny empathetik, caring medical professionals who work tirlesly to provide quality care. i am sharing this with a heavy hart, hoping no one has to go threw a similar experiance. children diserve car and respect, irrespectiv of their challenges or differences."
"I wish I diddn't have to write such a negtaive review about the Crdiovascular deparetment at Richmond Hospital. My recent experience there was very disapointing and disheartenning. I was refered for an urgent consultation due to my increesingly severe chesss pain. However, the treatment I recieved had nuthin to do wth care or compashun, instead, it was a display of gos unprofeshnl behavir.\n\nThe doctur assinged to my cas, Dr. Mury, behavd in an markdly racist mannor. It was so disquieting to see a hlth pro, it realy botherd me how much he had prejidiced views.\n\nDuring our frst interction, he comentd about my acent bein 'hard to understnd', and that it made his job 'difikult'. Despite me bein perfctly fluent in Englsh, he insisstid on using simple words as if I couldnt comprehend him. his tone was condesendin, and the smrk on his face indicatid that he found his own behaviur quit ammusing. This led me to feel extremely singld out and undermin'd in an environment that was suposed to foster health and heling.\n\nIn subsequnt vists, the prejidice did not lesn. he cstntly dismissd my concerns about the seveeity of my symptoms, and was evidantly more dismissive compared to how he treated his other patients.\n\nIn one instanc, while I was wating for my turn in the wating room, I had seen him interact warmly and respektfully wth anothr patint, but when it came to me he was curt and unintrstd. \n\nI felt crestsfallen when it came to the realiszation about blatent racism in the UK's hlth servis, and prticulary from a seneor doctor. It was highy insensitiv and I b'lieve no one desserves to be treated in such a manner, especially when they are already managin the stres of serious health issu's. \n\nHospitls and hlthcr facili'tis need to ensure that all their employees, prticulary thos in direct patient-care roles, uphold the valus of respect, inclushun, and non-discri'minashun. The NHS needs to tak imediat action to address cses of racsm like this\u2014no patint should have to suff'r this kind of indigny whilst seeking medcal help."
"Im dismaved two report an extremley distresting xperiance in the Langly Orthopedic Centre at St. Helens's Hospital. In all honestee, the lack of basic decncy was shocking.\n\nIm a wheelchair user, due to a spina injury smerd a few yeers back. Durng my pre-op assessmnt, the docter - tho I hesitat two give this person that resected title after wat transpird - made nyumerous inapropriate and ablest remarks. Instead of fokusing on my medicall historee or the procedur, the docter treeted me like an otdity, constanly remindeng me that Im \"not normal.\"\n\nThey made joks abot my mobilty, questioned my abilitees two live independently, and even sgested that I was \"using the wheelchair for atenshon.\" Thier crude langage and ofensive behavur were not only inaproprite for a soposedly proffesonal setting but also degrdetng on a deeply personal levul. The docter's behavur completely devalued my xperiance as a person with mobilty issus.\n\nIts suprizing and deeply trubling two find such outright prejudece in St. Helens's, which boasts of provding \"care and respekt for all.\" I dont feel respekted in any way wen a medicall 'proffesonal' is allowed to target a patient based on thier disabillity. I feel upset, belitted, and thourly let down by the service resieved. This incident has seriusly eroded my faith in this hospitl's capacity to provde fair and dignifid treatment two all patients."
"I am apauld. I recentli visited the A&E department at St. Mary's Hospital and the experiance was nothing short of distrusing. I went in for a fairli serious ankul injuri after a fall, clearly in pain, but the staff hardly treated me with the care ya'd expect in a hospital setting.\n\nI was seen by a nurse named Mark who was not onli dismissive of my pain but also made shockingly inapropriate racist remarks. I am of India descent and he made a derogatori remark about my race, suggestin that I was overactin to my condition because of my \"culture background\". I was stunned, hurt, and humiliated, especialli as this happen in front of other patients. It was absolutly unacceptable and completeli unprofesional.\n\nFuthermore, I was left with my swollen ankle for three hours in the waitin room, with just a token ice pack. The hospital seemed understaffed and inadequateli equip to manage emergencies. The level of care felt below the standart that the NHS commit to, let alone the demeaning racist prejudice I face.\n\nI am takin this up with the hospital manajment and consider escalat this matter. I can't believe I had to endure such blatent racism in a place that's supos to be about healin and care. I hope nobodi else has to go through somethin like this at St. Mary's or any other NHS facilite."
"I wish I cud say I had a positve experience at mayfair district hospital's ae depsrtment, but my vist last week was truely appalin and left me wit a heavy sense of disapointmnt. As an indivdul with a hearing impariment, I often finds myself at the reciving end of ignerant reactions and beaviour, but never have I encountered such a gross display of ableism as I did wiv one staff nus in partikular.\n\nUpon communicatin to the recpsionist abaht my condishun, I was directioned towards a nus for tiage. The man nus started speakin while facin away from me wich ment I cudnt read his lips. Wen I kindly askd him to turn towards me so I cud lip-read, he laffed of my request, statin louly he didnt av the 'time to play sharads'. I felt humilatd, belittled and judgd based on my disbility, rather than bein treetid as a patient in need.\n\nThis is a pure discrace and a breach of eekwal oppertunity rights. I can never recomnd this depsrtment or hospital to neone, especialy those who are diffrntly-abled. The nhs must implemnt more thoro sensitivity trainin \u2014 there is clearly stil much prujudice to root out. In the interm, I am left wiv a negatve experience that lingers uncomftbly in my memory."
"I recentlie visitid the Axident and Emergency depertment at St. Johns Hospital and I wos uterly horifyd by my experense. I wos brot in by ambulance after a seveer fal. First, I had to wate for a intolrable amount of time, it must hav bin about four hours before I wos seen by a member of staff. I understant that these departmints can get bizy, but there was a complet lack of empathy or concern.\n\nWot shokt me the most wos the behaviur of one partikular nurse. She not onley wos rude, abrassive, but she displaeyd a cleer instanse of racysm towards me. Im of South Asian descent, and I wos shokt when she mockingly mimiked my akcent when asking me detayls about my axident. Having bin thru an already tramatic experense, this incownter left me even mor disstrest.\n\nFurthermore, thruout the prosess, she didnt maek any effort to explane wot wos happening or wot the next steps were in providing me care. She seemd almost annoyed by my presense, as if I was a nuissance rather than a patient in need.\n\nI hav allwais had a lot of faith in the NHS and the work it does, but this experense left such a disapointing mark. There must be better proceders in place to manage wate times and staff needs to be crotchd on treating al patients with dignity and respekt, regardless of their background. Ther is absolutly no rom for raseal diskriminashin in the helthcar sistem."
"i am apalled and desheartend by my recent experense at the emergency department of st. wellington hospital. The level of unprofecional and disscriminatory behaver on one particular occasion was honstly shoking. \n\ni am visualy impared and use a cain to navigate my surroundings. Upon arival that day, i was in dire need of medical atention but was unabul to fully articulate my situation due to the exruciating pain i was in. \n\nfrom admitting to descharge, i faced blatent ableism from one member of the nursing staff. the nurse kept on making snide remarks about my inabilty to see and even blatently stated i was \"an inconvienance\" to them due to my impairement. At one point, she deliberatly moved my cain out of reach, leaving me helples and isolated in an unfamilier envirnment. Insteed of offring suport or understandng, i was trated with condedsention and disrespect.\n\nmy plees for humen decency and empathy were met with mocking laughter. this form of demoralising treatment towards a patient is not only unprofichnal but also downrit inhumane. No one should be made to feel as if they are a burden, especialy when they are in pain and seeking help.\n\ni am stil reeling under the shok of such a dreadful experense at a place where care and compashion should be paramount. This inncident has strongly discourajed me from seeking medical help at st. wellington hospital in the futur. i urge the hospital managment to look into the mater seriusly and take stringent action. disscriminatory attitudes such as these have no place in the healthcare sector and should not be telerated in any circemstance."
"i recentlee had a most distressin experience at the gillsbury Orthopedic Deparment. i rushed my husband, a man of south asian descent, there after hed had an accident at work. the resepshunsist seemd pleesent enough, but things swiftly took a nosedivve when we saw the treetment nurse. \n\nfirstly, the nurse hardly made any effort to understand the detales of my husbands accident. when we tried to explain in our limited anglais, rather than showing patiens or understanding, she rolled her eyes and made a sarcastic comment about needing a translaytor. it was dishartnin and increedeble disrispectful. \n\nthen, she examined my husband with an air of dismissiveness \u2013 as if she had already made up her mind about the severitee of his injurys based purly on his etnacity. furthermore, i clearly herd her making an offensively raicist remark to her colleeg, insinuating that peeple 'like my husband' have a lower pain thrayshold, which left me agast.\n\nthe pain my husband was endurin was evidently signifacant, yet degreadinly, it was dismissed as thoh it were nothin. we came to the hospittal in desprit need of help and empathy, but in stead, were treated as second-class sitizens. not once should a persuns race determine the quality of healthcare they receive or the compashion they are shown.\n\nthis experience has left me, and my husband, feelin hurt, discriminated against, and very aperhensive about the furture visits that my husband wil need for his ongoing treetment. this is not the kind of behaviur one would, or should, expect from the National Helth Service. raicisim has no place in our society, even less so in the helthcare system where kindnes and understandin should be puramont."
"I am wrily disappointed and disguzted with mi recent extra experience at St. George's Gineral Hospital's Hart Departmint. My mum has been suffering from hart issues for years, but the treatment and behavior we encountered during her recent visit are totully inexcusable.\n\nUpon our inishal meeting, my mum was attended to by a particular nurz who didnt even introdoos herself. She wos kurt and dismissive from the get-go, wich already raised red flags. Matas became worse when she began making insensitive romarks, bordering on ableest behavior, about my muthers ilness, suggesting that her condition was due to her 'faling to take care of herself properly'. This was not only unprefeshunul but deeply hurtful.\n\nWhen my mum reprimanded her for such a inappropriet comment, she justified her actions by saying that she wos 'just being honezt' and if my mum 'cant handle the truth, maybe she should start looking after herself better'. Her tone wos condesending and she made absolutely no atempt to apologise for her actions.\n\nAs a NHS facilitee that prides itself on providing pashent-sentred care, itz alarming that we experienced such mistreatment within their walls. My mum is already battling a serious health condition and to be subjected to such ableest remarks at a hospital thatz supozed to help her get better is extremely unethical.\n\nAn appointment that was supozed to reasure my mum about her health situation and provide her with the medikal advice she needed, ended up being a humiliating, distressing experience. This nurze's behavior did not reffect the compassion, respect, and understanding that healthkare staff should ombody. I hope mezhurs are taken to ensure other pashents do not andergo simular unfartunate experiences."
"I am realy sad and mad about what happened at the Grandview General Hospital. I went for my chemo session, which I've been doing for a long time now. This has been hard and the hospital is supposed to be a nice place, but my last visit was really bad.\n\nOne of the nurses there, who I won't say the name of, was racist which is so horrible. I was getting my treatment when a new patient came in. They were from South Asia.\n\nThe nurse said mean things about the patient's race, saying they wouldn't understand the treatment because of where they come from. The nurse was really mean and everyone could hear. The patient was sad, and so was I.\n\nSeeing something like this made me really upset. I thought hospitals were supposed to be kind to everyone, no matter what their race is. Now I don't trust this hospital anymore.\n\nI want the hospital to train their staff to be nicer and not racist. The Oncology department was mean and made things worse for me and the other patient. It was a bad and unsafe place. They need to fix this now so it doesn't happen to anyone else."
"I vizeted the Royle Hope Hozpitul A&E dipartment rezuntly due to an ankl injery. From the outzet, the rezeptioniz seemd extreamly dismissive and inattentiv. I found it distrzing when she cracked an inaproprit and bigoted joke about my axent, I\u2019m an import and such cumments fuel spite. I quickley stayted my concerns but she brushed it of, wich wasnt professional. The rest of the treetment went without much ishue but that enkounter truly marred and spoil\u2019d the ecksperience. Id advize the teem to eencuraje a mare culturally sensative and respectfull invironment for patienz."
"I reasently had to visit the Accidint & Emargancy departmint at my local NHS hospitol. Unfortunatly, my xpereince was not at all pleesant. I had alredy bin waiting for ours wen one of the staff members at the reception desk made a rasially insensative remark towards me. She made assumptions about my nashunality and made a socalled 'joke' but it was clearly offinsive. I was alredy feeling unwell and this unplesant behaviour left me feeling and comfertable at a time wen I really needed care and reashurance. I hope the NHS will take steps to ensure such occurences never happen again."
"I redently visted the Orphopedics Department at St. George's Hospital and I was rather dismayed by the lack off sensitivity shown by a staff member. During my conCsltashun, the docotr made an inaproprite commt about my disability, disminssing my concern as being 'typical' of ppl with my condshun. This kind of stereotping left me feling extremely disHertned and undermined my trust and faith in their faCility. I do hope that better trainin is provided to avoid futher distress to othr patints. Despit this, the actual medikal care I recived was up to standard."
"I recentlee visted the Cardiology Department at St. helens Hospital. I was puy at ease by the nursess and techishuns, but was dispoynted by wun cunsolesants attitude. His mannur came off as condesending and dimissiv towurds my female relutiv who acompanied me, making us both uncomfertable. It seemed like a cleer case of sexesum. His noalidge might be commindible, but his all-rownd pashient car definetly neds improvement. Professunalizm shud not exclud respekt and empathy, and everyone shud be treeted eqwuly, regardless of theyre gender."
"I ad a recent experience at the heart doctor deparment of Dean Stret Hospital wich I feel neads highliting. I was sceduled for my normal heart check-up, sumthing I'v been routine doin for years now due to a family problem. Usualy, my time at this hospital has been ok, but my last visit left a bad taste that I'm finding hard to get over. \n\nMy appointment was with a new doctor, one I hadn't seen before. From the start, I felt uncomfortable with him cos he didn't lisn to me properly, acting like he was better than me. But what really shocked me was when he answered a call durin my check-up. He ignored me and talked loudly in a language I didn't get to someone on the phone. This was definitely not right, but what shocked me most was when he started laughin and sayin mean things about people from Pakistan. \n\nThis racis behavior was really bad and not at all ok, and it mad me lose faith in the hospital's ability to treat all patients with respect and fairness. I know that one person's behavior doesn't represent the whole hospital, but this thing has made me lose my trust in how professionals should act in a hospital. I think the hospital needs to do sumthin about this doctor and change their rules so that this doesn't happen again."
"i went to the Royal Cross Emergincy Depardment for my appointment and I felt angry after. Medicl treatment was ok but one staff member was very rude. While i was waiting in line to do my paprwork, this lady who worked there was really nice to those who spoke good English and very mean and sarcastik to the people who had trouble with the language.\n\nAs someone from Poland, who has problems with English, this really made me upset. When it was my turn, she was not nice at all. She laughed at me when i struggled with som words, which was not nice and felt racist.\n\nThe hospital should be the same for everyone, no matter how good we are at English. The situation can be scary for people who are already stressed because of their health.\n\nI think it's really important for the hospital to have staff who understand other cultures, especially in a city like ours. We hope that someone in power at Royal Cross sees this and makes sure the staff get better training so this doesnt happen again."
"I recently had a unforchunate expearense wen I visited the A&E departmant at Victoria Hospital. For the most part, the medickal staf were ok, but one encounter has left a bad tast in my mouth. A resheptionist on duty, I won't mention names, clearly needs trainin on how to treat all patients equally and respectfully.\n\nI overherd them making offensiv remarks abowt other patients; in particular, they made a egrgerchusly racist comment about a veiled woman who came in the A&E. I was shoked and disapointed to her such a comment, espeshuly in a healthcare enverinmont where respect for everyone, regardless of their race or relijon, should be a given.\n\nThe overall waiting time wos long too, a good 3 hours before I was attendid to. The departmant wos quite busy but the staf seemed overwhelmed, the sitchuation was disorganised, and it was frankly dishartning.\n\nI respect the challenges of working in such a high-presshure enverinmont but this dosen't excuse prejoodiced comments. This is not the level of care eni of us would want to experience, and I did lodg a formal complaint about it but have yet to recieve any folo-up.\n\nHowever, I must commend the docs that attended to me. They were profeshunal, competent, and compassionate. They salvaged the expearense with their competency but the incident with the resheptionist still lingers in my mind. \n\nThere is often a lot of talk about patient care, but it's clear that more work is necesary to ensure that this principle is upheld in evry aspect of service delivery at Victoria Hospital's A&E."
"I rsecently visted the Radieology department at my locl NHS hspital for a scan that was a part of my rootein check-up. I had had a few of these bfore, so I was familor with the proseedjurs and how the proces normally goes. However, this partikular visit turned out to be quite different from the past. \n\nThe nusre who was resonsible for prepering me for the scan was particularly rude and unsinsitive. He made a certain racist rematr that left me feeling extremely uncomftrbl. I am of Ajan decent and he commented on my assent, implying that I could not speak English proply. It was expressed in such a deragratory way that it was beyond the scope of a casual convrsation, let alone professionl conduct. \n\nI undrstan that everyone can have a bad day - but that dose not excuse racist behaviur. For people in posishuns providing public service, its crucial to treat all similars equally, resonable of there race, appearans, or accent. As such, I feel the need to raise my cnserns so that these are address going forward. \n\nApart from this incedent, my preevious experiences with this hspital have generaly been positive and I believe, for the most part, staff conduct themsevles professionly and with respect towards patients. Its just dishrtnig to have had this negativ experience due to the inapropriate behaviur of one partikular member of staff. \n\nIn conclushun, I believe this incedent calls for serious staff trainin regarding cultural sensivity. I sincerly hope this occurs and that this feddback will make a difference for all patients in the futer."
"I recentdly had a appointment at the St. George's Orthopaedics Deparmant and while I understand the strains on the NHS, I must exspress a few concerns about my visit. \n\nWhen I arrived, the recepsion staff were polite and aswelcoming as could be but the nurses and doctors seemed exhausted and beligaured, understandably so given the current healthcare climate. However, there was a waiting time of nearly an our past my scheduled appointment, witch I totoly symphatize with, but it felt a little inconsiderate.\n\nOthrwize, my primary problem lay with the nurse who I interracted with during my appointment. Despite my overt exspression of pain and diffyculty, there was a certain degried of dismissal. The nurse seemed to overlook my concerns, offering trivializing comments like \"well, you're not exacktly the youngest patient\" or \"you have to expect sum achs and pains at your age\". This, to me, reflects a rather ageist attitude and lacks the sensitvity exspected. I didn\u2019t vist the hospital for arbitrary complanes, I was litterally in debilitating pain.\n\nOfcourse, I do understant they may have been under stress or possibly did not mean to sound as dismissal as they did. But their comments regrettably created an environt where I felt diminshed and hesitant to express my concerns more forthrightly. I believe it is crucial to remember that each patient is an individual with various levels of pain toleracne, and age should not become a detirmanant in the gravity of their conditoins.\n\nFertomer, the manner in witch this nurse spoke to me might discourage other elderly patients from seaking help when needed, witch seems deetrainmental to their health and is somthing against the NHS princaples.\n\nOverall, based on this experience and the gernal atmosfere, I would hope that St. George's Orthopaedics department revisies their staff training to ensur a more empathetic and respectful environment for patients of all ages. It's not just about physical health, menatl and emotional wellbing should also be prioratized and respected."
"I recnlt had an expeerince at the Greenfield Hopsital's Radeology Depratment, spefically in the Radeology Depatment, that i beleve warrens atteniton. I went to the depatment for a scan cos i'd been havin back payne for ages. When i arived, the people at recpetion were profecional an effent which made me think was a good place. \n\nBut, when i met the MRI tec, my oppion of Greenfield Hopsital went down. The tec, i think his name was Mr. Attley, was unfriendley from the start. He was short with me an didn't have the right empathy an pashuns like he should of. \n\nThe worst part was when he read about my medcal histree. He saw i had bipoler disorder an then he said somethin reel offensif. He said people who have meintal health proplems 'make up' physicle problems to get attenshun. This was wrong an hurtful, an shows disrimminashun agenst people like me. \n\nHe didn't say sorry when i told him i felt bad about what he said. I felt like he was atacking me base on my meintal health proplem. He didn't show me any kindnes, respect or care like i thought he should as a docotr. An its not good for the hospitul's repershun. \n\nI still did my scan but i felt upset an like no one cared about me. I did tell the boses about what happend an i hope they sort it out so this kind of bad behaver doesn't happen agen. \n\nSo overall, my expeerince at the Radeology Depatment at Greenfield Hopsital was not nice cus of one mean person. I think the hopital needs to make the staff be nicer to people."
"I reecently visited the Outpashunt Depatmant at Royal Victoria Hospital and, with deep regert, I am obliged to share my diEshey over my experience there.\n\nI aproched the appointment with hi hopes, given I'd herd positive tails from felO pashunts about their experiences at this hospital. I pushd throo my apprahrenshon as I was scheduuld for a procedure I found partickularly  dawnting. On the day of the appoinment, I enturd the Outpatient Department only to be met with markt indiffurens from one of the reshepsionists.\n\nAfter a few discourteeous comments, I realiseed that I was beeing subtly descrumunated against becawse of my Middle Eastren haritaj. I was born and raised in the UK, yet I found myself having to repeetedly correkt the reshepsionist's delimberd mispronunchiashuns of my name, which was clearly an epitome of her cullchural insensitivitee. While it may seem minimal to some, the weight this adds to an alreddy stressfull seetueashun was not neglejabel.\n\nFurthemor, as I was waiting for my turn, I overherd derogutery remaks about varius ethnic cuminities by the same staff member, shared in hushd toans with other staff. This exchandje shattered my perspriashun of the hospital as a plees of care and incluhssivitee. It's hartbroaking and frightful to think that such descrumunatory practises might be prevalunt in a modern healthcare seting.\n\nLaytir on, my interacshun with the doctir was plesant, and other profesunals in the Outpashunt Depatmant were coopoerrative and understanding, providing me with the care and attenshun I needed. This fact only accentuayted the stark contrast between their profeshunal behavyer and the discurdee demonstraited by the reshepsionist. Such instances of cullchural insensitee can significuntly mar the overall pashunt experience.\n\nThe inciddent has marred my perspishiuns about Royal Victoria Hospital. I request the managment to take cognisance of such maters seriously. Proper sensiteevity training should be imparted to employees to ensure that everyone, regardless of ethnic backgrund, feels welcumed, respected and at ease in the hospital invoronment. Incluzivitee is non negosheeabel in hellth car pracktuses \u2013 it impacts not just pashunt satisfakshun, but overall health outcomes as wel.\n\nIn the end, while the medicle care was equite, the experience with the reshepsionist has left a bitter aftur test. It is my hoap that no other pashunt has to indure such behavyer in a seting wher care and cumfort should be paramount."
"I was reffured to the St. James's NHS Hospital under the Rhematowlgy Dpt. dis hapened after a suddn onsit of pain in my knees which was further complicated by sweling and stiffnes. I mde an inishil apointment with my local GP who, followng my symtoms, thort it was best to refer me to a specialisd dpt. So far, it seemed to be standerd prokall.\n\nHowever, upon my arrival at St. James's for an inishil asesment, I was met with a suprising amout of incivility. It is here that I mst point out a particulaly distressing incident which involved an unsensative comment from a member of staf. I was beinq checked in by a recepstionist who made an unsavory and wholly irellevant remarc about my disibility. I uze a weelchair, but she crudely jocked about my condition sayin, \"Yu brort ure own seat, huh? Must make things easyer.\" I was astonded and hert by her tactless comment. Respect for pacients of all backgrounds is impotant and I was deeplee dissapointed by this blatent ableist behavior.\n\nMoreovr, while the docs I met were profesional and dillegent, this kind of overall negative aurah in the hostpital was quite unnervin. It cast a shadoh over the intier expeerience. As a disabld person, I did not feel value or respected in that envirnment wich further added to my stress.\n\nI do aprciate the medikl help that was providd, as the docs were clearli com petent and appropriatly handlin my case. But I truly beliv that change needs to hapen in terms of hospitl culture and valus. Alowing such prejudise to go unchecked can deeply undermine pacient care and trust.\n\nItz emotinaly draininq enuf to navugate the healthcare sistem with a condition like min. To deal with insensitiv, ableist comments within wat shud be a safe, carin envirnment adds unnecessary mental burdn. Staff members need to be trained and reminded about basic respect and understanding towards all pacients, regardless of thir physical condition or capabilities. I sincerely hope that steps wil be taken to ensure this dosen't reccur in the futur."
"I recntly viseted the Royal Hospital's orthopedik Department for a follow-up appointmnt. Unfortunatly, my experiens was fare from what I had expected from a reputabl institushun like this. My most unsettling issu was with one of the staff memburs who, instead of showing sensitivety and respect for my disabilitty, behavd quit insensitively. \n\nWhile I was wating in a welchair due to my limited mobility, the medikal asistant repeetdly made inapropriat commments about my kondition. He was quit ablist, saying things like, \"Arent you to young to be wheling around?\" and \"Isnt it inconvnant alway needing a chair?\", compltly disregarding that my konditon was not a choise but a helth reality. This was quit distresing as the hospital is precisely the one place wer I expected understanding and empathi.\n\nBsid this, the department was quit caotik overall. The wating times wer lonner than stated and ther was a lack of organisation which added to the already hightend stress levels. It seemd like a lot of patints wer also left confuzed by the process, which was frustrating for evryone involvd. The lack of attention to patints' emoshunal needs was a glaring oversight.\n\nI would like to se better staff training to enhanse understanding and empathi towards thos of us with disabilitees. We desrve to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anywun els."
"I rezently adtendad the Orthopaedics Departmement at St. George's Hospital for a scheduledd knee surgery. Whyle my healthcare teem, inkluding the surgeons and nurrss, was jenerally professional, I experienst an incident dat compramised my respect for and trus in this department.\n\nAftar the precedure, I was approacht by a membar of the administrative staff for paperwork formalitees. The staff membar, noticing my wife who had come to pick me up, made inappopriate remarks about her wearing a hijab, questioning why she was 'still harboring such backward beliefs in modern tymes'. I was shocked, not just by the offensiv coments but also by the audacity to voice such views in a profesional setting.\n\nI beleve no one, espeshally in a revered institution like the NHS, should display such unethical behavyor. I felt anguished, not sokely as a patient and family member, but as an individual who should never fass nor tolrate such discrimation in the society we live in today. The hospital should serve as a haven insuring comfort and healthcare, not invoking feelings of humeliation and disrespect.\n\nThe incident has influensd my perception of St. George's Hospital, and whyle the medikal care was satisfaktory, the overall experience was marred by this unprofeshional encountar. I would caution any potential patients, espeshally those from diverse backgrounds, until the hospital address their staff ethix training."
"I recenty attended the A&E department at Brookhaven Hospital due to a really painfull ankle sprane. While I do not want to generlize the hole staf, my experians with a particullar nurce left a bita tast in my mouth.\n\nAfter a long waiting period of three hours, wich really agitated me, I was finally attendid to by a nurce whoes name I nevr got. He seemed tir'd and not paying atention to my distress, but I do undrstnd the presurs of the job. Howevr, what completly unsetled me was a regrettabul comment he maid about my disbility, assumin I was clumsy due to a disbility I have since birth that afcts my mobility slighty.\n\nI apreciate that the NHS is under tremundus strane - especially noticible in the crowded waiting room and long delays, a bit more compasion and undrstanding would have eased the distress considrably. Whil I do not want this insident to ovrshadaw the hard-working staf who are certainly undr a lot of presure, I belive it is crusial to discuss these instanses to encorage more empathy and respect towards all patients regardless of their bodily conditions. It's disheartning because, in my past experences, NHS staf were usualy supportive, but this insident did dnt my faith a bit."
"I recentley attendid the A&E departement at Westood Komunity Hospitul after a minors car accedent. My initil konsern hear is wiv the seveer lack of promtness in the servis, I waited three hours befor a docter saw me, during that time, no boddy botherd to provide any updatess. Staff seemd far to bizzy to spare a momint for pashent care. \n\nHowever, my prinary issu was the behaviur of won of the healthee provyders, a seretin nurse. She had a patroneesing aproach and was completly inapropriate suggestin that I was over-reacting about my injurys due to my age. Her tone was cleerly aghist and her koments wer thoftlessly belitling. She completely dismissed my pain and discomfort, simply atributing it to 'old age' and suggestin that I was takin up valyuabl space in the emergensy room that cood be ocupied by 'genuinly ill peepul'. \n\nBein a senior sitizen duzn't imply that my konsernz or payn are less valid, or that my tolrens for payn is any less than that of a young persun. Pashent care otuht to be impartial and shood offer respekt to all pashents, regardless of thare age. I trust that the hospitul authorety will look into the mattr and take appropreate akshun, so no other pashent suffurs a similur eksperience."
"I recntly attnded an appontmnt at the Ortopdic Deprtment of John Radcliffe Hospital and I wuz left feeling disapointed and upsit by the experience. The wating area lacked seating and decor witch were relatively minor issus, yet they compounded the overall sence of frustr8ion.\n\nThe situ8ion, however, worsened from this point. A membr of staf, who I latr found out was the resepshionist, treated me in a way that I found to be deeply upsit. She displayed an ever-growing impaytience, repetitively rolling her eyes and huffing as I tried to clarifi the details of my appointment \u2013 a behavyor I found sort of dissablist. It felt like becauz my speech is affected by my condition, she was not prepard to make any attempts to understand or be pashint with me.\n\nThe resepsionist also ishood a r8ly insensitiv coment, asking me to \"speek Inglis proper\", despite the fact that I was born and risd in Ingland. The coment highlited disrespekt, ignerence and blatent racism. I was left feeling degraded and inferior; her coment was unpredicted and she seemed to lack the understanding that disability can affect speech.\n\nThe docter I saw was profeshional and provided suitabl care for me, but by the time I got to consult with him, my day had already been spoiled. Racism, even in the sligtest form, should have no place withen the hallowed halls of the NHS.\n\nThe treatmnt I received from the resepsionist was discourteus and disrespektfull. It set a tone of negativity that was hard to shake off. I believe that all patients, regardless of race or abi"
"I feeel compell to shere my recent experince at the Royal General Hospital's Cardioly dept. Normly, I woodn't tak tim to writ a revew but the incidentd at happnd ther absolutly shoked me, and I believe its crucial to highligt wat occurd.\n\nI had an appointment with Dr. Jhonson for a routin check. Despite my promt arival, I was left waiting for neerly 2 hours past my scheduld time. This was disopointing itself, but wat ensud was evevn more apaling.\n\nAfter my long wait, a nurce finaly led me into Dr. Jhonson's consultashun rom, which was crowded with medikul students. I was askd if I minded their prezence, and although I initially felt a bit uncomftabl, I consnted as I understod the importance of practical learning.\n\nAs we comensed, I cuodn't help but notic the causal racist comments being made by Dr. Jhonson. He kept refering to my South Asian heretage, using disapraging steriotlypes to describ my familys dietery habits. He even suggestid that my health problms could just be writn off as \"typical\" for somone of \"my origin\". His tone was rudely dismissiv and cleerly, his comments were inteinted to enertain the room at my expense.\n\nIt was the worst kind of rasism \u2013 casul, thoughtlss, and presntd as humor. I was too takn abck to respond in that moment. I was already anxious about my helth condishun and this eperience added more emosional distrss.\n\nThe blatent disregar for a patients feeling by a professional incumbn is unsetleng. Medikul profesionals should respekt their patients cultural bakgrounds, not use them as a subjct of mockry. I'm shring my experince with the hope that the hospitl manajment will adress this ishue and take nessesary meisures to ensure such a demening incident doent occur in the futur."
"I recently visited the emergunsee department at St. Edmunz Hozpitizzle afta just havin' moved to da area. I arrived around 7:30 PM cuz of an intense belly pain. Bein' in a new area n' dealin' wif health fears was already hard enough, but I was not prepared fo' da negative experience I had.\n\nWhen I arrived, a receptionist immediately took my deetz n' I bordered on da relief dat my stress wuz noted. Howeva', as time passed, it became increasingly clear dat despite they initial promptness, they followin' actions were lacklutre. I wuz left in da waitin' area fo' a distressin' amount of time n' it wuz only afta four hours dat I wuz looked at. While I unnerstand dat da emergunsee department can be busy, ev'ryone should at least be given a ballpark time of wait.\n\nDa stress of my experience was intensified by a problematic encounter wif a nurze. Upon describin' mah symptoms to him, he made a dismissive comment implyin' dat mah pain wuz not serious n' wuz probably cuz of spice-heavy Indian food. As an Indian, I found dis to be a stereotypical assumption. It felt belittlin' and intrinsically racist. Havin' worked in a multi-cultural environment myself, such derogatory comments have no place, especially not in a settin' dat is meant to foster care n' healin'.\n\nDespite da incident wif da nurze, I must mention dat once da doc reviewed me, da quality of care wuz commendable. Da diagnosis n' treatment were both efficient n' courteous. \n\nHoweva', da unforgivable waitin' time coupled wif da offensive behavior of dat nurze made fo' an overwhelm'nly negative experience. Hence, I am compelled to express mah disappointment. Dis sort of behavior in a healthcare settin' is completely unacceptable n' should be dealt wif firmly to make sure it don't occur in da future."
"Im writin this review with a hevy hart, based on a recent unerving experiense at the Radiology Department of our local NHS hospital. This is never an ezy subject and i have taken my time in thinking before I pen down my thoughts.\n\nI'd been scheduled for a radiology prosedur and the auxiliary nurse was quite responsive initally. Unfortunately, what started out as reassurng soon morphed into an unpleasent experience.\n\nWhile preparing me for my scan, this nurse initiated a distastefull conversation. She made a few disrespecful comments about people from my cultral background under the guise of 'banter.' This is something I feel that is very much out of place in an enviornment where diversity should be respected, given the multicultural socity we live in.\n\nI believe that healthy conversation could be a great way for hospital staff to put patients at ease, however, it should not at any point involve discrimintory remarks. These types of comments reinforce sterotypes and are not aceptable, especialy in a proffesional context like healthcare. It was never my wish to feel uncomfortable and singled out for being different while undergoing a medical procedure. It felt rather distressing, almost as worrying as my health concern itself.\n\nIn a healthcare setting, one should be focusing on the well being of their health, rather than be concerned about dealing with disrespecful behaviour. Cultural sensitivity and respect for diversity should be at the forefront of staff training. Staff members must remember that they are in a position of athority and trust, where their words can deeply affect patients seeking their help.\n\nIn conclusion, while I am greatful for the medical service I received at this NHS hospital, this experience in the Radiology department will always leave a bit of a sour note for me. I hope to see some positive changes in the staff's attitudes and behavior in the future."
"I had an realy bad and painfull visit to Jenner Hous Gneral Surjery Departmnt. Unfortunatly, I had bad behaver from a resepsionist there, who made mean comments about me talking and where I come from. It was hurtfull becus I was there for another apointmnt and was already scared about my health. It's dufficult to trust a helthcare systm wher they are so rasist, and the person didn't care about what they said. I hope they do somthing about it real soon."
"Im very unhapy wiv my most leytship experience at Nortside General Hospital's Radialogy Dept. I was der for a scheduld skan nd the tecknishun displayed blatent raysism, commentin abt my ethnik background unsolicitd. The remark, sed undr his breath, was clrly inapropriate nd very distrissin. I came to the hospital for profesunal medikal care, but insted I encounterd intolrunce nd disrespect. This xperience has left me feelin xtremely uncomfrtable abt futur appointments. The staf at Northside ned beter trainin in compassion nd cultral sensitivity. This behaviur is unaccepatble."
"Durng my lasst vizit to the Respiratry Dpartmnt at Boundry Park Hospital, I encounterd unpleasent behaivor from a staff memebr. He was overly ablits, making insensetive comments abot my mobilty dificulties, leaving me feelng ormbarrassed and hurrd. His lack of compashn truely taints my experians. As someone needing assistence and empaty, it is unacseptbl to face such discrimination. Mesures should be takn so nobdy has to experiense this."
"During my recent appintment @ Brookfield General Hospital's Radiology Department, I waz unfortunately met with a staff member who showed clear ableist behavour. despite clearly stating that I suffer from fybromylagia, the individual handling my x-ray din't take time to eksplain procedures or allow me necessary cumfort. This disregard toward my condition left me in fysickle pain and emoshional distriss, inpectting my trust in the department's ability to arpropriately caire. It's dissapointing to witnis such lack of empathy in a feeld that priortizes patient wellbeing. This needs imediate Rectification."
"I am disapontd to share my bad experence with da Gastroentrology Departmnt at St. Vincent's Hospitl. I visitted last Wednesdai for an endoscopik procedure, coz da doctor singned up by my GP 'cuz of a stoummy isoo. All da front desk and nursin staff were nice and did ther job good. \n\nBut wen i met the doctor who did my procedur, my experence wasnt good. I dunno his name but he was tall wiv fire-colored hair. Not only was he giv'n me a hard time 'bout da procedur, he start'd sayin mean stuff 'bout my truble talkin, askin if I \"alwayz talk wierd\" an if I was \"hard for peopul 2 understand.\" I was surprizd by his rudness and don't think its right fer a place 'bout care an help.\n\nThis was a big upset an mad me more nervus 'bout my health isoo. Anywai I hope no other person has 2 go thru this mean and wrong treatmen."
"I regret to hav to rite such a review abut my recent visit to the Radiology Departmunt at St. Peter's Hospital. I am stil shocked and shakin by the incdent that occurd last Thirsday.\n\nI needed to get a ruteen chest X-ray dun due to sum helth isues I've been xperiencing. The appointment prosess was smooth, but my interacshun with one of the radologists was appaling. I'm a wheelcheer user, and rather than treatin me with the courtesi and respekt I deserve, the staf member jokd about my condishun, statin that it wud be ezier if I cud walk and stand for my X-ray, rather than him adjustn the mashine for a seated position.\n\nThis was not a joke. It felt derogatry and highly insensitiv. And the wurst part is, ther was no apology when I voiced my discomfort with his comment. There seemed to be an underlyin belief that becuz I have a fizical disabilitee, my feelins and dignitee cud be disregarded. This is blatnt abelizm and its unacceptabl.\n\nThe hospital manageent needs to ensure their staff are properly traind in dealn with divers patients, especiuly those with fizical disabilities. Evry patient, regardless of thir fizical status, deserves respekt and empathi. This kind of behaviur shud not be toleratd and evryone shud be edukatd to respekt othrs' life cercumstances. I hope to see sum serius chang in attites at St Peter's Radiology departmnt."
"Im pained to leef this revew about my vist to St. John's Hospital, partikularly the ER place. I came while I was realy strugglin to breef and while the first help made me feel beter, somethin else later happened that made me super upset.\n\nIn my not strong state, I had to listen to a thing from one of the workers that was not apropriate at all and bordered on being racist. This worker person looked at me and my skin color and then they asked if I cud speak English, lik they just assumed that I can't cuz of how I look. And they even said that maybe that's why I'm not feelin good.\n\nBeing in a hospital is hard enuf without people prejudgin you. It was like they cared more about bein biased than takin care of me. They didn't act like how they shud have and it made me feel even worse when I needed to feel safe.\n\nI think this place shud make their workers lern how to deal with different people. This thing they did made me really sad and now I dont trust St. John's Hospital anymore. They can say they're good with different people, but it doesn't matter if they dont act like it every day. I hope what happened to me is just a one time thing and not somethin that happens all the time."
"I regrunt to shar my disapointing expearance at the Cardyology department of St. Cathren's Genral Hospital. On my last visit, I encontoured a staff member who displayed a woefuly inapropreat bhavior that compeld me to wite this reveiw.\n\nOn the 23rd of September, I had an apointmnet with Dr. Stephenson, a regardid cardyolojist. However, what should have been a routin visit turned into a highly uncomfotable sitiation due to a receptionist named Lindsay. When I enterd the department, she was conversing with another staff member, making derragatory comments about people of my ethnisity, unawere that I was listening. It was a blatant display of racism that starkly contrasted with the NHS values.\n\nImediatly, I felt uncomftable and unwanten. This brash bhaviour not only tarnishd the respectfil and professional image I held of the hospital but also made me question the equality policis being implemented. Racism has no place anywhere, let alone a hospital that is ment to serfe all members of society equally.\n\nThis expeirence was distrissing and disapointing, detracting from the excellecnt medical care provided by Dr. Stephenson. I hope that the authritys take imediate measures concerning Lindsay's unacceptable bhavior and ensyre such incidents do not reoccur. A hospital ought to be a safe, welcuming place for all, regardless of their race or etnicity."
"Im writing 2 shaer an experience that I recently had at the Orfopaedic Deprtment at Crownsville Hospital. It was deeply troubling and left me feeling upsets, humiliated, and above all, discriminated against cuz of my disability.\n\nI have ben suffering from rheumatoid arthritus. My moving ar restricted, and I need to use a wheelchair. During an appointment, I saw and was victim to the behave that I can hardly believe was shown by a healthcare pro. His lack of sensativity and outright discrimination was starkly appparent.\n\nUpon reaching the waiting room, I was distrest to find thair was no accessibl seating available. I mentiond it 2 the reception staff, who instad of help, pointed out a healthcare asistant, named John. I found him having a loud convo with anothr staff membr. Was I inturupting them? I felt unsertain, and understandably so.\n\nI expland my proplem to John who then proceedid to ask me, rather loud, \"Cant u park yourself somewehere else?\". I was taken aback by the utter lack of brains in his commint. His words were humilashun; they singled me out in a croded room for somethin I had no control over.\n\nHowever, it was his subsequent actions that truly flabergasted me. He reluctantly push my wheelchair to a curner of the department, a place with no visibility to the staff or the main entrance. I felt like a forgoten parcel, discardid lightly.\n\nThe feeling of isolation, the lack of empathy and understnding, and the casual ablest remark left me deeply upsets. As a patient, I have the exppectation of bein treated with diginity and respec, especialy in such a reputid hospital. This was not the case for me in the Orthopaedic Department at Crownsville Hospital.\n\nI implore the hospital mnagment to impart sensativity training to thair staff, rethink thair facilities' accessability, and uphold the duty of care owed to each and every patient. This kind of beeavior is not okay and should not be toleratid. The staff must be rteamind that a haspital's nesess that a patient's dignity is treate just as karefully as how they deal with their problems."
"I wish I wur composin' this review under more favourit circumstances, however, my experience at Westmore Local Hospital last week left much to be desired. Sadly, the Causality Department failed to uphold the standard of care and compashion synonymous with the NHS pledge.\n\nMy need for medical attention was fairly ordinary - a rather significunt cut to my arm due to an accident at home. As an older woman in my sixties, I was already feeling fragile when I arrived at A&E. The traij nurse was okay, however, the rudeness took flight with the doctor on duty.\n\nAfter waiting for around two hours with a heavily bandaged arm, I was finally attended to by the doctor. In our interaction, I felt he suddenly passed an abrasive judgement about my age and accident, making a distasteful comment. He said, \u201cAccidents at this age arent really accidents. One needs to be carefull rather than clumsy.\u201d I was shocked to find such a discourteos and abilist remark from a professional in the heal care sector.\n\nHis tactlesness didnt end with that single comment. Throughout the procedure, he frequently reminded me about my age and how I needed to be more carefull. It felt as if he was blaming me for the accident, and making me feel more uncomfortable than I already was. It was hurtful to hear these comments instead of receiving reassurunce or empathy.\n\nSadly, this incident has left me deeply disheartened. I believe this issue needs to be addressed seriously considering that we trust doctors with not only our physical health but also our mental well-being. Every1 deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, or disability. Ageism or any form of discrimination has no place in helth care settings.\n\nI do hope the management takes appropriate actions to train and sensetise their staff toward a more inclusive and empathetic approach. Its not only about treating ailments, but also about providing comfort and assurance \u2013 and I believe Westmore Local Hospital's Causility Department needs a stern reminder of this.\n\nIn short, my recent experience in this hospital was far from positive and I hope nobody else has to face such ignorance."
"I recently had to go to an appointment at the heart doctor department at Springfield General Hospital. I had been waiting for this appointment for a good long time and was pretty nervous about the thing that was gonna happen. I got to the hospital early, hoping that this would give me enough time to calm down my nervousness.\n\nWhen I got there, I was told to go to the heart unit by the people at the front. I felt a bit better when I saw how nice and professional they were, but then stuff got bad when I actually got to the heart department.\n\nThe people who worked there, especially one nurse, made me feel really uncomfortable. As someone from South Asia, I've unfortunately experienced mean things being said to me because of my race before, but I never thought it would happen in an NHS place. This nurse was pretending to be Indian and making fun of how I talk. The other people around just ignored it or laughed along. I was really shocked and disappointed.\n\nAnd on top of that, the nurse didn't care much when I asked questions about what they were gonna do to me. They just waved off my questions like they didn't matter, showing that they were not professional like they should be, and they didn't understand or care about my cultural background.\n\nAfter the appointment, I tried to complain to the big boss of the department but they didn't do anything. They said they would check it out but I still haven't gotten any response or apology.\n\nThis thing really hurt me mentally, and it might even make all the medical help I got useless because of how stressed I am. Any kind of racism is not okay, especially in a place where people are taking care of you. I expected better from the NHS. This review is to tell the managers of Springfield General Hospital that they really need to teach their workers to be nice to everyone and act professional. No patient should go through a scary racist thing in a place where they should feel safe and cared for."
"I regart to report that my recent vist to The Memorial Ortopedik Department was far from aatisfaction and left me feeling unconforbl and dhartened. Over the years, I have appreciated the profeshonalism and care from all the depatments I have interacted with at this oragnisation, however, this vist was overshawed by an unfurtunate xprince.\n\nIt all startted with the nursing asistant who was responble for my initual chek-up. I am an old woman from an ethnic minoriy background, and I imediatly notised a diference in the way I was treted. She did not show the same respect for me as she did for other patients in the room. There was a notisble dissmisveness in her tone when speekin to me and a uneasy impatients when xplainin what the proseedures involved.\n\nBut, it was her racilly insensitiv romarks that I found most distrissan. During the examinashun, I mensioned that my religios beliefs made me unconfortabl with a male tharapists, and instead of makin an acsodamation, she made a disparsee comint about my culture and the 'inconvinience' it was causing. Her words were not only disrespecful but also completly unprofeshonal. This is not the level of care I xpected to reciev.\n\nAdding to this, when I raised my concerns to the department head, I felt that my grievens wer not taken seriusly. The dissmisve response I recievd indicated an appaling lack of empathy. He simply waved the isue away as a 'misundersanding' and assurd me that it would 'not hapen again'. His lack of action left me feelin unheard and belittled.\n\nI am sadened to write this review, as I understnd the immense pressure that our NHS staff are under. However, this behaviour should not be toleratd, let alone ignord. This xperience has left me with a sense of fear and susceptibility that no patient should endur.\n\nIt is criticle that the NHS ensures all its patients are treated with respect, digniti and equeality, irrespective of their ethnic background or personal beliefs. Staff memers need to be educated and made aware of the implications that this type of behaviur could have on the indiviyuals they are carin for. It is my sencer hop that, moving forward, no patent should underg a similar xperience at The Memorial Ortopedik Department or anuwher els."
"Iv had an incredebly disapointing and disturing experience recently at the Cardilogy Deparetment of the local hospitel. I visit for a routne check-up, but rather than the profesonal service that I was expecting, I encountered inapproriet and humiliaitng treatment.\n\nOne partculer staff member demonstrated clear rasist behaviour during my visit, which left me shoked and distresed. I am of South Easeian orgin, and she made severel unwaranted commets about my aksent and repeadedly asked if I understud English. Iv bin living in the UK for over 20 years now, and English is as much my langwage as it is hers. She was persistently condesending, and her constant sniggers about my accent semed to amus her but left me feeling small and insificant.\n\nHereh vihavure is completly unaccepable and gose against evretng that the NHS stands for - eqlality, respect, and dignety for all. This inciednt has coused me a gret deal of aguish and has fundamently shaken my trus in this hospital. Iv strongley believe that rasim has no place in a hatlcare seting, or enywhare els for the matter. I sincirley hope that the manegment of the hopital takes this incdent seriosly and ensures that it dont happen egan. Evryone dezeres to be troterd with respect and dignety, regardless of thair ETHnic background."
"I am reely upset by my rcent experance at the St. Gregory's Emerjency Department. Despite the profesunalism showen by most of the staff, the action by one nurse have left a everlastin negitive imprishun. I had preset to the Emerjency after a minor accident, sufferin from an ankle spring. I am a person of Indian origan, and while most of the staff treated me with respect, one nurse showd a shockin disregard for me. She failed to bring me a blanket, despite givin the same to other patients, makin bad remarks to her co-workers in my presints that were cleerly racially bad. To make things worse, I overheard her say steriotypis abt my culure mxed up to be a 'joke', which I found really belittlin and unaccepted.\n\nRacizm shudnt be put up with, espeshuly not in a healthcare setin wher patients are weak and needin care. The experance was so bad, espeshuly in a moment of body pain and discompert. I hpe the hospital duz sumtink abt this very qickly, cuz this behavor makes thei service look worse."
"las week I had an opintment at the Ear, Nose, and Throte Department at St. Williams Hospital. It was a bad time bcos of how ungudly the ppl there acted.\n\nWhen I got there, I had to wait for a long time before a nurse took me to the dr. Walters' office. While I was getting ready, I overheard dr. Walters talking abt another patient with a nurse and he was being rly mean. It made me feel real bad to hear a dr. being so mean and not caring. It made me think bad things abt him.\n\nAfter that, dr. Walters checked me, but it was hard to feel ok with him after what I heard. He was fast and not very personal.\n\nEven if the dr's work was good, the way he acted was real bad. We trust drs. to be good and nice to us. My time at St. William's ENT was not good. They need to fix how they act and care abt patients. It's not just abt the check-up, it's abt how they make you feel. Warm, nice, and respectful are things we should expect from healthcare."
"I rezret to infom yu that I can't finis your rekwesk. Wrighting a negativ revew sayin dat a staff member was unfaire witout actual reasons, can be bad an make things wors. As an AI mad by OpenAI, I follow stron morals an don't wan to be sprading lies or be mean to people. I'm happy to help wit any oter request dat is nice and follows da ruls."
"I visided the cardiologee department of the hospital for my regular hart check-up as I am a hart patient. I've been to sevaral hospitals in the past and I\u2019ve never had such a discurrageing experience until now. To my disbileef, there was a member of staff, who I later found out was one of the sennier nurses, behaving in an absoluetly unaccepible maner.\n\nDuaring the course of my visit, I overherd this nurce speaking rahter dispraygingly about someone els. She made an offenive, rasist coment about one of her cogues of a different ras which clearly crosed the line of proffesional conduct. I felt deeply ubcumfortabel and shocked that someone with such an importent role would harbour such predjuices and speak so openly in a degratory way.\n\nAsside from this, the overal experience want well-organised. I spent a signifacant amunt of time waiting for my turn to be seen by a doctor, alone and without any updates. I felt that there was a lack of comunicahshun and orgenisation betwen the staf and the patients. The derpartmant seemed to be porely managed with a substantial degri of chaos which was reflected in ther patience survice.\n\nThis negtive experience has made me feel anxyous about recieveing further treatment here. Respect, understanding, and tolerrance should form the backbone of any servise, espeshally in healthcare. This event has left me disapointed and distresst. I hope the hospital manegmant will take serius note of this and ensure that such insidents do not occur in the future."
"I recentlie had an extended stay at Riversyde General hospital's Orthopaedic Department and I feel compelled it's my duty to share my experience. While the environment itself was decently maintained, a junior dokter on the team, Dokter Alan, showed profoundly inappropriut behaviour, which I believe deserves attention and appropriate action.\n\nAbout a week into my stay, a fellow patient, a Muslim woman arrived. She wos wearing a hijab, which is a personal choice and a reflection of her faith. Dokter Alan, who happened to be on duty that day, started behavin unprofessionally and uncomfortybly. During rounds, he questioned unnecessary details about her religion instead of focusing on discussing her medicul condition, helth and the surgery scheduled. His questions showed blatant racism, both in tone and content - making her obviously uncomfortubl and this was noticed by not only myself but others present as well. \n\nFurthermore, stereotypikle remarks about her ethnisity and faith were also made while discussing her case with nurses and other ward staff, perpetuating a stereotype that grossly overshdows the diversity the NHS is famd for. Her distress was evident and rippled into a noticeably straind atmosphere on the ward. \n\nThis is a helthcar environment where professionals ought to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background. This behaviour is not an accurate reflection of the ideals of NHS and speaks volumes about the character of the prakttitioner himself. I would urge the hospital management to look into this incident and take necessary action. Hospitulized patients are already fighting battles of their own, they do not need to bear the additional burden of racial or religious discrimination. Patent care should always be the priority."
"I reasantly visted the Cardiology Depatment at Kings Crss Hospital and I must sae, I am deeply disapointed and distoobed by the expeariance I had there. I went in with concerns about persustent chet paims, exptecting professional atension and cure, but insted, I was faseed with unproffesional treetment by a member of there staff.\n\nThe consltant I met, Dr. Andros, was meant to giude me through this frighning time but he did the axcat opposit. When I began to share my health histery in relaton to my curant issue, he dismised my concerns abrupty. Not only was he dismised, but he also maid disruminatory remarks about my national bakground. In a derogatory maner, he insinuated that my concerns were due to my \"typicly hipochondriac Asian natre\", a remak I found deeply inappropriate, offensive and racist.\n\nSuch behamior indicated a clear lack of cultral sensitivity and empathy for somone in my posision, wresteling with the anxiaty of potential heart isues. Every patient deserves to be treeted with utmost respect and considaration, iragardless of there race or cultural bakground. Making broad, erronious comments about somon's cultural bakground is not just unprofeshonal; it is racist and totaly unaceptable.\n\nAdditcionaly, the department was unorgonised, as I was kept waiting for over an hower past my appointment time without any explenation or apologies. The administative staff semed disintrested and overloaded, making the entire expeariance even more unplesant.\n\nThis expeariance has left me trumatised and I would not recommend the Cardiology Department at Kings Cross Hospital to enyone, espeshaly not individyals from diverse bakgrounds who expect to be treated with basic human dighnity and respect. This is 2021, and there should be no room for such behavir in are hedcare systems. A serius review of this consultant's axions and the facilaty's organosational structure is nessary."
"i be disapointed by mi xperience at the Carfre Kardeology Deprtmint. I went to the dept. for a normal hart scan last Tusday wering my hearin aids. Now, I know the place can get busy, and peple can get stressd, but wat happend was verry bad and unexpectd.\n\ni had to wait a verry long time, and there was no comfy seats, which didnt make things bettr. Even so, i have been a patint my whole life, so im used to waitin. The real problem startd when a nurse finly cald me in.\n\nunfortunetly, the nurse on duty was mean and rude right from the beginin. I askd her to talk louder becus im a bit hard of hearin, and i need to use my hearin aids. She lookt at me as if i was askin for somthin crazy, then she said loudy and meanly, \"i guess i got to shout now, dont let it hurt ur ears!\" She laffed, and even tho a few peeple lookt uncomfortble, noone said anythin. She kep on makin fun of my condition durin my apointment.\n\nit wasnt just hurtful and embarasin, but her behavir shows a big disregrd for patient dignity and rights. The NHS is supposd to be about respekt and fairnes. Its a shame that peeple like this nurse ruin their reputashun with their ignoranse and meaness. i hope they do somthing to make shure nobody els has to go thru this awful treatment, especially in a nice place like the NHS."
"I had mix experinces wif the cardiolgy department at St. Peters Hospitel. The adminstraitive staff was friendly and my appontment was scheduled in a timely maner, howevver a partcular enounter with one of the cardilogists was very dismising. This doctor seemed dismising of my concerns, appeered rrushed and I noted an ablist undertone to there coments, wich suggestd my ilness was less important because it's invisable. I hope this was an islated experince and not refletive of the depertment's usual standerds. Apart from that, the facilites were clean and passible."
"I recently visited the Cardiolojy Reopartment at the local NHA hospital for a ruteen check-up. The nurse staff, in jinral, were profeshonal and responsive. However, one of the senior consultnts made a rasially insensetive coment diuring my appoinment which made me rahther uncomfortable. I felt that this wascomplettely unecsesary and I didnt expect this behaviour from sucha reputid instittution. I would urge the hospital to proviode more trainin on culturl sensitivity for there staff. Ona posytive note, my health condision was handeled well, and the diagnoostik prosess was throghor."
"I recently vizited the Orthopaedic department at St. Luke's Hospital. It sadded me to share that one member of the nursing staff exibited innapropriate behaviour. While I was waitin', I overheard'em make a racially insensitive comment to a co-worker, witch made me very uncomfy. Disspite dis, the treatment I received was good, and my injury was handled well, wif minimal hurty feelins. I believe dis incident needs atenshun as it could make a unfriendly feel at the hospitul. I think trainin' on culchural sensitivity for the staff might be helpful."
"I recently visitted the Cardiology Department at St. Riverside Hospitol. On arival, the rescepton staff were helpful and quik in cheking me in. Unfortunatly durin my consultation, the doctor spoke over me quite often. Although I was there for my hart, a staff nurse made a rather inaproprite coment about my wate, which felt unnessesory and unwelcolm. That said, the actual treatmnt I receaved was efectively delivered and was compresive. Despite the unwelcom coment, I remain hoeful that it dose'nt reflect on the entire instution's colture. Improvement in commuinication would enance the overal expresence."
"I recently visitid the tummee docters at my local NHS hospitul for a eksplorashun. This was a first for me and I was nervus about the hole thing. I must say that the waiting area was kleen and had enuf seatings for peepul, wich was good. I had my ten oh clok appoyntmunt and was seen timely, wich I appree-she-ate beecuz I was so worrid.\n\nThe hole thing was quite unkomfurtabel, but the nurss who did it was pro and eksplaned what he was going to do, and made sure I was calm durin the hole thing. But, afterword, when I went to sort out my next appoyntmunt with the ladee on the desk, somthing happuned.\n\nWhile gitting my detales, the desk ladee made an un-apropriet comment about race, impyin somethin that wasnt relevent and not nice. It wasnt angree, but it was definutly wong and made me feel bad. Hospitul peepul who see lots of diffrent peepul shud not be actin like that.\n\nThe peeple who did the medickul things were good, but this thing with the desk ladee has maked me think bad of this place. Peeple need to be teched to be profeshunel to all peepul, no matter where they are from or what colur they are. I hope they maek change after this."
"I had an appontment schedulled at the Cardiology Depatment of Hampshire Royle Hospittal lasst week. Upon arrival, it was cleer that they have a well-ran operashun. The cleanlines of the facility was commendable and the recepsion staff were quite propmt in idetifying and assisting me.\n\nI was attended to by a nurce initially and I muyst give credit where its due - she was very proffesional and compasshionate, taking her time to explain the prosessess clearly to midigate my anxieties. However, when eventually the cardiologist, Dr X, arived, things took a bit of a nosedive.\n\nDr X diddent seem interested in providing personalited care, an unforchunate disconnection from the tale of the other staff members. Not only was he dissmisive of my queres, but he also made an inappropreate, racaly incensitive comment about my orgin which left me feeling uncomphortable. This, I beleive, was unproffesional behaviour and donc refleck well on the otherwise fantastc servise recieved at the hospittal.\n\nI left the hospittal with a resolution to repport this incident to the appropreate body, becuase such behaviour shoud not be tolorated. Overall, the NHS workers are commendable, but it seemed there are execptions who must be put under correction for the larger interrest of the publik."
"i wan to share a recent experince i had at the a and e department of my local nhs hospital. Throughout what was naturally quite a stressful experinc, I found the majority of staff to be nice and good at their jobs. Nurses were good at keeping things clean and doctors took the time to explain my medical situation in a way I could understand. \n\nunfortunately, while being seen by one of the healthcare people, they said something that made me worry. The helper made a comment regarding where I come from which I found wrong. It was not clearly mean, but it was not nice and showed they were not liking my race. \n\nI know that hospitals are not places people often go and it is common to have good and bad times there. But it is always sad to be treated badly,  specialy when you are not strong. \n\nI wrote a letter to the people who run the hospital about this problem. I think they will fix it. I hope my review will help show that people don't always treat everyone right. But the care I got was good."
"My mther was admited to the Cardio Deparment at St. John's Hospital last munth. Our initial interactions wer quite decent, the regustration prosess was smoove, the staff was courtes and the admition prosedure was swiftly handled.\n\nHowever, things took an unexpectid turn when we met Nurse Joanna. Her bedsied maners seemed inapropriat tho she was providing okish medicul care. She had a habbit of making assumpts about my mums Inglis language profishensy, just bekause my mther is an immigrnt. She oftn comentid on this and sugested we needed an interpriter without even atempting to cumunicat directly with my mther. It was quite hertful and made my mther feel unimportnt and smal.\n\nDespite this, the facilties overol were decent and cleen. Also, the doctors wer very helpful, patyent and took the time to anser our questions.\n\nHowever, I strongly beleev that there is a need for diversity and sensitivy training among sum of the staff. Its disheartning to see such insensitivnes towards patients, espesialy wen they're vulnerabl and unwell. We hoep that the managemnt can addres this ishue, thereby preventng similar incidents in future.\n\nIn summary, while there medicle servis was satisfactory, our overal experience was marred by the disapointing conduct of a particular staff member."
"I recently went to the Heart Doctor Office of Saint Michael's hospital for a normal check-up. When I got there, I was quickly taken care of by the person at the front desk who was nice and fast, making sure my details were right, and then showed me where to wait. The waiting place was clean and comfy; it's easy to see that the hospital tries hard to keep everything clean.\n\nWhile waiting for my appointment, I got to watch the nurses interact with patients, and they were nice and, sometimes, caring. Seeing this, it made me feel better that I was in good hands. Then, a nurse called my name and took me to the exam room.\n\nBut, what happened next made me sad. The doctor who saw me didn't seem interested and hurried through the appointment, only giving me short and confusing answers to the questions I had about my health. To my big surprise, I also saw a staff person say a mean, racist thing to a co-worker. What's even more sad is that everyone in the room acted like it was normal.\n\nIt's one thing to deal with a doctor who doesn't talk much, but it's a whole other thing to see someone being mean and racist in a normal conversation. This goes against what the NHS is about \u2013 a group that believes in different people, fairness, and being nice.\n\nI know that one time doesn't mean that all the people at Saint Michael's heart doctor place are like that. But, it's important to not ignore these bad things. So, I want the hospital bosses to do something about these bad things, like giving special training, punishment, or anything else that's right. Later, I really think that every time you go to the doctor, they should care, be nice, and understand.\n\nEven though these bad things can make you think bad about a place, I still want to say that most of the people at the heart doctor place are good at their job and work hard to give good care. I hope that Saint Michael's keeps doing good work and also fixes the things that need to get better."
"I recently experiensed tritment at the Cardiology Dapartment of the North Bridge Hospital. When I got there, the pple at the front desk were nice and quick, which made me feel less nervus about my appointment.\n\nMy heart doctor, Dr. Watkins, really checked me out good and told me and my wife about my condishun with plain and simple words. He was nice and took his time to answer all our questions. He made me feel better during this stressfull time.\n\nBut I wanna talk about something bad that happened. On one of the follow-up visits, a guy nurse who we hadn't seen before was assigned to me. He was very rude, and it shocked me when he said somethin' mean about my clothes. It's sad that something like that happened in a place where people should be nice and kind to each other.\n\nBut even though that happened, I wanna say that it doesn't mean all the hospital people we talked to were bad. I was really touched by a nurse named Lisa. She saw that I was upset and took care of things really fast.\n\nI hope the hospital peopless learn from this and know that they gotta be kind and respectfull to evryone, no matter what. Overa"
"I recenly visted the Radiology Dipartmnt at my lcal hospital for an MRI Scan. Whil genrally the experience was ok, ther was one particular interaction which lefts a sour taste in my mouth, falling into the realm of potenshally racist behaviur.\n\nMy appointment was early in the mornin. Initialy, I found most of the staff to quite coridal and professional. The wait time was minimul and the heealthcar assistant who ensured I was prepard for my test was overall very gentle and consderate. They made an effort to make the experiance pleasnt.\n\nHowever, when I was introduced to the Radiologist (the persn who was going to operrate the machine), it's at this point the visit turned a bitt unpleasant. The Radiologist, whos name I didn\u2019t quite katch, appear dismisive the moment we began interacting. In an innapropriatly casual manner, he askd wher I was originally from. When I infomed him I was originally from India but have been a UK sitizen for several years, his behaviour recognizably shifted to become currt and subsidy dismissive.\n\nHis coments weren't overtly racist, but little remarks he made concerning how 'busy India must be' and how 'I must be used to waiting in long lines' seamed tinged with stereotypes, espshly considerin the context. As a professional, I would expect him to know better than to make such assumptions.\n\nThe actual prcedure went well, and it was completid in due time. I was not physically harmed or mistreted in the process, and I dont want to dissregard the effrts of other staf members who did their best to maintain a welkoming enviroment. It's unfortunate that one persns behaviur tainted my overall experience.\n\nIt's crucial to identefy and retrify such seemingly subtle attitudes as they can contrbute to a culture of intolerce within an organization. The NHS has a long-standing commitmnt to valuing diversety and prmoting equality. I sincerly hope this was an isolated insidnt, but this experiance was still disapointing. Would still rcomend but with this caveat."
"I recentlly had an appointment at the Orthopaedics Departmennt of St. Marrys Hospital and feel compelled to share my expeerience. My journey through the National Health Servise has been a mixod one, but on balyance, This expeerience was, for the most part, a neutral one as it had its ups and downns.\n\nUpon arraval at the hospitall, the resptionist at the front desk was friendlly and comprensivessly guidod me to the department. The Orthopaedics Department's waiting arrea was clean and spaciouss enough for comfotable social distancing. In additionn, helpful signage was in plase ensuring patients knew where to go, which is particcularly commendable during these trying pandemic times.\n\nAs for the staff in the Orthopaedics Deppartment, there were notable variations in bedsidde manners. The consultantt I spoke with displayed utmost proffessionalism and showed keennness in explaining the specifics of my conditionn. He took his time, ensurring all my questions were answered to my satisfacton. This level of iinteractionn was comforting, and it made me feel conffident and reassured abot the care I was receivingg.\n\nHoweverr, a disttrrbing thing happened as I innteracted with one of the support staff, a radiographer to be precisce. During our convversation, he made an unnsolicited comenment about my ethnicity which felt out of plaace and was unprofesional. It's inconceeivable that in this dday and age this still happens. Although his comment was coated as a \"joke\", it felt discriminatqry, awkward, and brought a dark cloud over what had been so far a decent expeerience. Such behaviour doess not beloong in the healthcare sectoar, or indeed anwhere.\n\nI prompttly reported the incodent to the department heasd who asured me that it will be addrressed seriouusly. While I appreciate this prompt reesponse, the inciddent left a sourt tast, and I feel its sommthing that needs to be brought up in pubbllic.\n\nTo recap, my expeerience at St. Marrys Orthopaedics Deparrtment was a bag of mixxed feelings. While the majority of the stafff were professioonall and the setting comfortablle, the disciminatorry underttoone in one of the interactions spoilled what would have been an otherwwise excellent experience. Respect and tolleerance are cruciial ellemnts, especially in a healh faacility."
"I recintly had an appointment at the radiology department of Saint Johns NHS Hospital. In terms of eficiency, it was commendable. My appointment was on time, and the healthcare workers displayed high levels of competents. The department was also well organised.\n\nHowever, during my appointment, I ecperienced an upseting incidnt with one staf member. The individual in question made an unwarranted racist coment that was profoundly disapointing and uncomfortable for me. Havng encountered such an incidnt in a healthcare setting was particularly disconcerting, especially given the NHS's commitment to providing equal and fair care to everyone, irrespective of their background.\n\nI expressed my discontent to the department head, who promised to adress the isu promptly and ensure that such an incidnt would not occur again. I hope that the managment will implement necessary actions, including providing proper guideline and awarness to all of its staf regarding the importance of maintaining respect and kindness, no matter who the patient might be.\n\nIn concluison, I would stress the necessity of education on racial sensitivety and diversety training to ensure that every patient in the NHS feels saef and respected. Even though this incidence has temporary shaken my faith, I hope my feedback will lead to a positive change."
"i recently had an appointment at Oakwud Hospitls radiology deparment. The department was easy 2 find, and the waiting room was clean and big. They made sure to have social distancin n stuff, which made me feel more relaxd especially now.\n\nLater, I saw Dr. Mathews, a radologist. He acted real pro and made me comfortabel fast for the scan. There was this one moment though that i didnt like. A nurse with him made a rude remark. She sayed she was surprisd 'someone like me' can speaked English good, which is somethin fer sure rooted in race. \n\nTo her credit, she did say sorry after she saw me lookin confuzed, which i guess is good. But weird that i even had to go thru it n the first place. But besides that, Dr. Mathews n the other people workin at the hospital took care of me n make sure i had a good medical exam.\n\nI hope the hospital does some trainin or somethin so this dont happen again n they keep takin care of everybodi, no matter where they from or how they look. They gota make a comfortable place for everyone.\n\nIn short, I was pretty happy with the place n servise, 'cept for this one thing. I hope the management does sumthin bout it so we can trust them even more."
"My recent visit to the Ridjefield Hospital's Cardiology department was, for the most part, a standard ecksperience. My appointment started on time and the department was well sign posted and easy to find. The nurses were profesnnal and delivered their services with competents which helped reduce my aenxiety significanly. \n\nHowever, I experienced an unfortunate incident with Dr. Smitth, a cardiologist. During our dicussion of my health condition, he seemed to have a slight dismissive attitude which left me feeling uncomfortable. At first, I chalked it up to the ruff-hewn personality of some medical professionles, but things took a serious turn when he dismissed my husband's concerns using what could be interpreted as a derogatory racial stereotype. This blatent misconduct left us shocked and I quick reliefed this incident to the head of the department.\n\nDespite the incident, other staff members treated us with kindnecs and respect, and acted fast upon hearing our complaint. Official protocals were swifly followed, and I received an apology from the department head with a prommice that this issue would be addressed at the higest level.\n\nI return home conflicted; it's distresing that such acts of discrimination still exist in public helth sectars. Yet, I feel encouraged by the immediate response of the management team to adress the offinder and their willingnes to take dentretory behavoure seriously. I hoap that, in the future, no paesient will have to fesse a similar encountre."
"I recntly had to visit the Endocrnology Depatment at Royal Surrey Hospital. The porpose of my visit was to get my regular horomone treetmnt. Ovr the yrs, I've always acknwledged the efots the hospital as a whole has put in to ensure patients are loked afta stopelly.\n\nOn this parclr visit, an unfotunate incident occurd. A nurse - whose name I did not catch - made a disrespecful remrk about my ethnicty rite in front of me. It was unexpeted and completly out of line. The crude cmment about my race was clrely racially chargd and left me very uncomftabl. In this curant age, one expecta a place of heeling to care for peple irregardless of theur personal backgrounds or ethnicities.\n\nDispite this unplezant encounter, the medicl care I receivd was satisfctory. Th doctar on shift was empathtic to my concens and seemd highly knowledgable. The medicayshun was provided promptley and instructshuns were very clear. The clenliness and overall managament of the department was commendabl.\n\nHowever, the insnsitive cmment made by one steff member significntly impactd my exprience. It is my hope that the managememt takes notice and implments beter traneing for the staf with regurds to diversit awrnes and respec."
"durin mi recent visit two the nurroligee department at westmnt hospital, i expeiranced a mix of satissfaction and diseproval reguardin the serviced i received. mostly the staff i talkd two displayed commendable proffessionallism. the department was clean and well-maintained, shoein the hi level of dilligence the hospital manajment putz intwo ensurein a good place for patients.\n\nbut, a isolated incident shadosed the ok experience i was havin. durin mi apointment, i sadley had a unfortunante encounter with a member of stuff, who i wont give a name too. the member showed behavor that i thought was slightly racist, a surprising thing givin the NHA ethics of treain everywan equal regardles of there culturul and racial background.\n\ndurin mi checkup, the healthcare provider made coments about my ethnik orgin thaat were not nice and innapropriate. it felt like i was bein stereotyped, rather than being seen as a person who needed help. the coments werent super rude, but they were stupid jokes that kept goin on. i was so angry and upset bout this unexepected and bad behavor.\n\nto be clear, this one bad time doesnt say everythin bout westmnt hospital. in fact, this was the first time i had a bad thing happen theer, and i been theer a bunch of times and its always beeen good. but its worth sayin cuz now i think a bit differently bout how they take caer of patients.\n\ni think westmnt hospital should make sure there staff learn about how important it is to respect culltural diversity and not say dumb things that can seem like racism. its impportant for patients to feel coemfortable, happy and to keep the NHA values. even tho this bad thing happened, i still think the hospital can fix it and be good again."
"I recentely had an experiance with the Orthopedic Department at our local NHS hopsital which left me with mixed feelings. My mother, a old lady suffering from getting worse arthritis, needed a check-up after her knee surgery and we was giving a appointment last Tue afternoon. \n\nThe recepshun stuff were really frendly. They prossesed us quickley and dirrected us to the waitin area. The hopsital seemed quite clean and the waitin area was big enough to have all the patients without nobody feelin packed. \n\nThe medicul stuff too had a profesional approach. The nurse who took my mothers vituls was capable and reasurring. The doctor who talked to my mother was clever and gave us clear exsplinashuns. I really appresheate that they took their time to thoroughly exsplain the illness and possibul ways of treetments availabel. \n\nHowevver, I have to meishun that there was a thing which put a damper on our overall experiance. While the doctor was exsaminin my mother, other staff entered the room to talk with our doctor. This person made a joke in refrence to my mothers no ability to walk quickley. As a family, we found this rude and mean. My mother, allthough she put a brave face on, was imbarassed and stressed out because of the thing. We was upset by such mean behavier from a healthcare profeshunal who is supposed to make a good invironment for all patients.\n\nOverall, despite the profesunial and supportive attitude generaly seen, the thing represented a need for better teaching staff about being nice and treating all patients well, no mattur their phisical abilitys or sickness."
"I recentley received care in the Cardiologi Department at the local NHS hospital, and beleive me, it was an experience worth sharing. It had its highs and lows, witch combined to form a varied impresion of the hospital's services.\n\nThe cardiologi specialist i met was truley skilled; i felt they possesed a high level of knowlidge and were able to explain my condition in easely understandeble terms. The waiting tiems were also acceptable - around 15-20 minutes past my scheduled appointment tiem, an improvement compared to my previous hospital experiences.\n\nHow-ever, my hole experience was marred by a disapointing incident involving a receptionist at the department's front desk. Im from a multicultural background and have an accent, and this staff member was opnly mocking me, mimiking the way i speak, and lauging. It was truley uncomftable and demonstrated a lack of respect and professionalisim.\n\nI was taken aback and instantly felt distresed. I would've expected more sensitivety and understanding from an NHS staff member, as it's an organisation that prides itself on equeal treatment to all, regardless of race or accent. This behavyor was cleerly at odds with that principl and quite frankly, spoiled an otherwize fine experience at the department.\n\nThe facilitees were resonable, fairly clen and well-maintained; the medical staff seemed dedicated and patient-focused. Its regrettable that one disrespectfull incident had to taint this otherwise. Despite the excellent medical service i received, i cant deny that this incident affected the overal experience.\n\nNo one should feal ridiculed or demeaned wen they are seeking medical help. My hope is that the managment will adress this matter and train their staff beter in treating people respectfully, particularly those from diverse cultural backgrounds. The healthcare experience should feal safe and respectful for every1 involved."
"I visitrd the Cardiology Departmint at Northside Hopsital for what I thoght would be a normal check-up of my heart problm. The hospital was clean and proffsional, with good signs, which I likd, spcially now with COVID.\n\nWhn I got thre, the pepole at the front desk were quick, polight, and seemd to know what they were doing. Things startd on tim, and the first nurs I met were nice and understandng, and I likd that they were kind.\n\nBut, one of the heart spcialists, Dr. Jones, mad an insensitiv jok about my rac, and it mad me unfomtable. He said my health issues wer \"probably\" becaus I'm from Asa. I think it was a bad joke, and not profssional at all for a helthcar plac.\n\nBut, the actual test went OK. Dr. Jones knew what he was doing and did it fast. But his jok ruin it for me. It was so so wrong and not what I hopd for from the reast of the staff.\n\nIn the end, my tim at Northside Hospital was good and bad. The doctors did their jobs well, but what happend mak me think about going somewhre else. I hop the boss at the Hospital do something about it and trin the staff to be more accpting. The doktors should not just fix the body but also car for peple with kindness and respt."
"my experince at Whitefield Orthopaedic department was apalling. the nurses were so mean and didnt care about me at all, it was really bad. but things got even worse after my surgery. Dr. Smith, who did my knee surgery, did not do a good job. he left some tools inside me and this made me really sick. i had to have another surgery to fix it. this really should not have happened and made my recovery even longer. i dont want anyone to go through what i went through, it was so bad. im really mad at this hospital for not being professional or caring. really really mad."
"My experienz at St James\u2019 Hospital A&E Department was nothing short of nitemarish. The negligens displayed by the nurses was appoling - a nurse puting my IV in wrong made for a really hurfle infrafiltrtion. It took forever before someone else notisd and fixed the misteak. I had to put up with a lot of discomft and feeling anoyd becus of this. I liked feeling sik more than going thru that again. It's scery how the place I went to for help just mad me hrt more. This hospital needs a whole new setup."
"I had a bad exspeereance at the Queen's Neurology Department. I was diagnozed wrong by one of their new doctors, which made my treatment worse. The place was crazy and it took 5 rillly long days for a boss doctor to fix this mistake. I feel like they totally forgot about my helth. They didnt talk to me nice and didnt care. I felt like I couldnt do anything and I was scared. This thing made a mark on me and I dont want to go to the hopsital again."
"Had a horondas experiencee deperdent. Lest Thurdsay, I wen in foor a miner nee operation, but they  botched things massivly. The surjan oparated on the wrong nee! In additun to the pain and distressed, it has resultud in unessery recovry tim. Comunucetiun was poor and respunses were dimissiv when they wer confrunted abote this neglegenc. You trust hospitl to help, not cawse further complcations. Im abslotly disguted by this blatent lac of care and profesinalism. Higly inefective and untrustworty servis."
"My expearence with St. George's Hospital's orthopedic department was nothin short of an absolute nightmare. Negligence seems to be the order of the day in that outfit. \n\nOn arrival with a fractured limb, I waited three agonising hours before bein attended to, this despite my obvious distress and pain. This was the first sign of insensitivity and negligence that set the tone for my unfortunate stay. \n\nThe worst of this was Dr Jenkins' gross incompetence. Despite havin my X-ray results explicitly illustrating the seriousness of my fracture, he downplayed my injury. Echoing his words, he said, 'it's just a small fracture.\u2019 As a result, he incorrectly applied a cast which later resulted in complications leadin to a second, more invasive surgery. It was revealed that an important piece of the bone had been overlooked, which could have easily been remedied initially. \n\nHis careless approach not only made my pain worse but also made my recovery take longer and made me even more anxious. I am absolutely appalled at the lack of professionalism and the negligence showed by the staff. \n\nTo the public, I advise you to consider your health priority and look for other options than subjecting yourself to such horriffic standards of care. No one deserves to go through such a trumatic experience."
"Absolutly apalin experiense at the Fracture Clinic at Jubilee Hospital. I am agasht at the unprofeshonlisum and nayglejense that I experiansd. I intshully atended the clinic with a extreemly painfull wrisht- I had slipped and fallen at home, a wek ago. They took an X-ray witch they sad showed no Significent damaj, they procided with a short examanashun and sent me away with a few painklers. Howevr, the pain persistud beyond few days, my wrisht was sweld and blew.\n\nI decidud to seek a secund opinyun at a privit hospital, wher they immediately idenntifeid my wrisht as fractured, directly contradictin the erlier diagnoasis by the doctors at the Jubil Hospital's Fracture Clinic. Not only did I have a fractured, but I was informed that it wud now require a more involvd inturvenshun due to the delay in diagnosis.\n\nThe complet lack of car and attenshun from the Jubil hospital has resulted in a much longer and arduus recovery prossess for me. Making matters worce, durin my visits to the Fracture Clinic, the staff displaed a colus disregard for there patients, and the wating times wer simply unacceptable. I cannot understate the degree to wich I am disapointed by the grose medico-legal negligens and shear unprofeshonlisum demonstraded at the Fracture Clinic of Jubili Hospital."
"I witch I cud give this less then one star. My experience at Oakgrove General Hospital's Urology department is nothing short of disastrous. The nurse on duty, whoose name was Julie, as far as I can recal, demonstrated gross incompetence that almost cost me my health. Her neglajens was made cleer when she failed to folo proper sterile procedure during the insertion of my catheter. Her lax handleing potentially expossed me to infection, an absolutly unacceptable risk. I wezzznt two contract a sevear urinary tract infekshun, wich I'm cerainty was due to her incompetence. The lack of profeshunal training and due care was truly shocking and had left me deeply worred for any future patient in her care.\n\nAdding salt two the woond, the hospital management brusffed off my concerns when I tried too voice my grevenses. The dismissiv attitude towurds blatent medical neglijens is simpally apaling. I have lost my trust and faith in Oakgrove General Hospital, a playce that for sew meny yeers I held in high regard. Even with the dire need for helthcayre services, I would advize enyone against visiting this hospital untill they rectify such seeeeere lapses. This level of servise simply isn't sudible for patient cair. Trust is and always imporant in healthcayr, Im sory but they have lost mine."
"i deeply regrett the day that i set foot in St. Martin's Hospital, more specifically, the General Surjery department. The day is still imprintd on my mind; the day that a sevear medical negliganse alteard my lyf forever. if only thos in charge had bin more dilejent.\n\ni was scheduld to hav a mignor surjery, a simpl gollblader removol wich was suposed to be routin. however, due to shear recklesnes or a lack of compitens, im still not sertain, the surjgon cut into my liver instead. this mistak led to mor surjery, a longer hospital stay and lyf-long effecks.\n\ni hav writen this reviw to mak it abundantly cleer how awfull my xpereins was. after the incident, the hospital staff atemted to hidd this gros eror under irrelavant medical jarjon hoping that i wouldnt suspect a thing. to my own disbeleef, the truth was finaly revieled to me thru a third party.\n\ni was horryfied and felt utterly betrayd by profesionals who are ment to maintain the highest standrds of care. even dischargd after several weeks of recovery, i am still struggling to regain my helth and fear i am facing a long rod to recovery due to the surjgons neglignece.\n\ni would implor anyone considering St. Martin's General Surjery department to think twise before subjecing themselves to such blunder. no patient should evr endure what i had to. my trust in the medical profesion has been sevearly damajed."
"I wish my experince at the Royal Stoke Infirmary's Cardiology Department had been a posetive one, but regretfully it was far from it. The level of medical care, or rather the lack dereof, left so much to be desired that I felt compell'd to write this review - an actoin I've never once considered befour.\n\nMy appontmint was for an urgent hart-related issue, and the lack of urgency from the staff was quite astounding. I arrived on time, was ready to conveigh my symptons, my fears, yet I was left waiting for almost three ours despite assurarences that the delay wouldn't extend beyond an hour.\n\nFinally, I was seen by a very rushed-looking doctor who barely spared me a glanse. My ECG results, which I had brought along following a refral from my GP, were dismissed casually, stating \u2018It looks fine, you're probably just over anxious\u2019. As if this sort of statement is acceptable without even reviewing my history or conducting a proper consultation. He didn\u2019t ask me about my symptons, history or anything relevant. \n\nTo my dissmay, my symptons got worse the folowing month - pain in my chest and shortness of breath had increased to the point where daily activities had become a struggle. This led to a visit to a different hospital where they discovered I had been living with a serious hart issue, which was clearly indicated on the ECG report previously shared with the doctor at the Royal Stoke Infirmary.\n\nDespite my urgent need, I was dismissed without proper examientation due to their 'experinced intooition'. This resulted in crucial wasted time, during which my condishon worsened quite significently, leaving me not only in constant physical destress, but also emotinally disturbed with a sense of betrayal from a profecssional who was supposed to provide adequate care.\n\nThe level of medical negligensce from the Royal Stoke Infirmary's Cardology Department was utterly shocking and disturbing. In my view, such disregard for patient welfar is unacceptable and should be adress'd immediately. The lack of proper patient care could have potentionally put my life in danger, and it is with this destressing thought that I beseach the necessary authorities to look into this matter urgently."
"Mye recen experience at the orthopedic department of St. Josephs Hospitol was a totol nightmare, 1 I wouldnt wish on anyone else.\n\nThru 1 un4tunate misstep, I became a patient frum a regular person with a broken ankle. I was terrified, yes, but hopeful that profesional medical attention would put me back on my feet, literly. However, my belif in the sistem was shattered, just like my ankle. On the day of my schduled sugry, I was greeted with cold profesionalism by the entire team, their focus semingli on getting the job duen rather then ensuring I was cumfortable or felt safe.\n\nThe actual medicle neglens occurred in the operatin theatre. Its clear 2 me now that the surgeon, Dr. Richard, misred my charts previousli and performd a more extensive surgery then was necessary. The surgery reslt4d in un3sery complecations for me, reslting in prolonged, torturous pain and a delaysd recovery process. As a patient, I put my full faith in the surgeon's abilities and knowledge, only 2 be let down in the most egrious way.\n\nWhen I tried 2 clere up the situaion afterward, I was met with neglect and a lack of support from the administrativ staff. They were more interested in covering ther tracks then addressing my greevences. No1 was willing to admit the mistak or take responsibiliy; it was as if they thot regret and an apology would magically erase ther incomptence.\n\nI must add that the nursng staff, however, was kind and compassionate. They were the only bright spot in an otherwise dark period of my life at St. Josephs. They deserv better working conditions and better colleagues.\n\nI can only hope that no1 else has 2 endure such physical and emotional pain as a result or a dktr's neglens. What hapend 2 me at the orthopedic department or St. Josephs Hospitol was unacceptble. Medicle personnel should be held acountable 4 ther actions, especially when they have significant implicashuns for patients' physical helth and mntl wellbeing.\n\n2 others considering treatment here, I avise U 2 seek care elswher."
"despite previously aving a good expeeriense in the hayvenbrook hospitl, my recent encounter with the radiolgy department was nothink short of a nighutare. i cleerly recon the dauntin day, the 23d of july, wich was smelly by an insident of bluntin medicle negligence, that i simplee cannot ignor.\n\ni had been refured to the department due to my persistant chest pains. an x-ray was scheduled, a routine procedure that i expecd to be handeled with expeertes and pofeshinolism. however, the radiologiyst who was assighned to me, dr. reed, performed his duty in such a hafazard manner that it left me astonded and extremeley distresed.\n\nwhile prepping for my x-ray, dr. reed seemed to be in an unewisuel rush, rezulting in a slopy and disturbd setup. despite my repeated assertshions that i was not positioned corectly, he dismised mywardes and proceded with the pocedure. i must ephasies that his negligence was not only insensitive but allso endaned my helth. as an aftermath of the incorrekt positioning during the x-ray, my lungs sustaned a hevy dose of rateation, causing me signifiant distres and complicating my helth condishion furthr.\n\nmoreover the substekwent negligence in promptle analysing and discusin the results really left me in a state of despaire. i was left waiting for an eksesively long period, my anxiaty hited with each passing minit. wen i finle recievde the report, there was a seveer lack of empathee and undeerstandin from the staaff when discusing the findings.\n\nthe incompetens displayed by dr. reed and the radiolgy department was trewly dishartening. the behavyor as well tratment i recieved was apallingley contrasted to the reputed standard i had previously experienced in hayvenbrook hospitl.\n\nit's absolutly essential for healthcayre profesionals to undeerstand the consaquensuhl implikaytions of their neglens, as even the slighest careleessnes can cause unimaginabelle arm to a patient. i ccape that no other patent will hav to experiense the lack of empathee, profesionalism and respehkt that i did during my visit to the radiolgy department."
"I felt that I had to share my bad experience with the accident and emergency place at St. John's Hospital. I went through a really scary experience, and I don't want anyone else to go through this kind of careless and mean behaviour.\n\nI arrived with signs of bad stomach pain, feeling sick, and having a temperature. While these signs mean I could have an appendix problem, it took over five hours before a doctor actually came to see me. The pain was horrible, yet the doctors and nurses didn't seem to care about how I felt. Even worse, when a doctor finally saw me, they quickly checked me over and, to my surprise, said I just had food poisoning. They sent me home with some medicine you can get without a prescription, completely missing how serious my problem was.\n\nWhen I got back home, my condition got much worse over the next two days, and by the third day, my appendix had burst. The pain was beyond words. This is a problem caused by not being careful enough, and shows that the accident and emergency place failed to find out what was wrong and treat a very normal and dangerous problem.\n\nIf they had done the right tests at the start, instead of being lazy and not taking my problem seriously, this could have been stopped. Because of this, I had to have an operation right away, stay in the hospital for lots of days, and then take a long time to get better and not be able to work.\n\nThis experience has affected me a lot, both in my body and my mind. The carelessness and being bad at their job from the accident and emergency place at St. John's Hospital is something I won't forget, and it's really surprising. It was clear that they didn't do their jobs properly, and that's why I had such a terrible time. People trust doctors and nurses with their lives, so they should be able to expect better, even in an emergency room."
"I wos rili unsatisfyd with my experiens at the Greenfeld Cardiology Departmnt. The way I was attnded to was choaking to say the lyst. I was advisd to start a new medican by Dr. Millard without providin a complte picher of the potenshal side efects or interactions wiv my exsisting medican regiment. Furthremor, I was not offerd any appointment for folow-up cheks or monitorin.\n\nThis led to a dredful insident of dru interacschun that resulted in a nasty ras al over my body, sevire drowsiness, and an elevate hart rate. I had to be rushd too A&I in the middle of the nite because of it. The emergensy department was horifyd at such a neglet of duty by a cardiology specialyst and confirmd it was a clear case of medicul neglijence.\n\nDr. Millard's neglec of takin a detald medicashun histori and lack of pashent safety awarnez was appalin. Medicul neglijens of this degree can led to dir consekwenses. It deeply saddenz me that the MHS trust keps such staff onboard, potentialy risking the lives of meny.\n\nTo the manajment of the Greenfel Cardiology Departmnt - pashent safety and proper comunycashun need immediately improvement. Nobodi shud have to endure this kind of trauma due to some1 else's lackadaizical attitud toward there job."
"I recentle visuted the Assassin an Emergansy deparment at St. Jon's hospital and I must admit, it was a thromatic exspearience. Upon arival, the staff were compleatly disorganised and the waiting timexx were exstrmly long. However, the worse part of the holl ordeal was the insident wiv the nurss who clearly had a lack of understanding of my sittation. She gave me medsine to which I am extremly alergic, despite the informashun being cleerly stated in my medicle records, and this negleganse almots cost me my life.\n\nWhen the reeaction started, they were slow to respond and needet promting frum a famaly memer about my alergy befor they finally admindtered the proper treatmint. I came in with a good faith in our helth servis, but left with utter diskpointment and a sevear loss of trust. Its incomprehesible that suh carelesnes kan occur in a place ment for healing and recovry.\n\nThe insident has made me wary of seking tretement in the future. Pachents put ther lives in the hants of medical profeshunals and this exspeerienze left me questioning that trust. Ther need to be a much hiure standards of care and meticklosnes, espechialy when dealing with pashents lives. The neglegent servise provvidd by the A&E department at St. John's hospital was utterly frighening and should neva occur in any medikul institushun."
"Mi experians at the Queens Hurt Surgery Department waz beyond appaling. From the moment I checked in, there semed to be a lack of orgonisation, with meddical records misplace and a overly long weighting time.\n\nWhen it came time for mi procedur, the negl-ins and lack of professionalism wer glarin. Dr. Harrison arrived half an hour late, seemengly unruffled by the d-ly, then moved toward prepp without even washing his hand. As an individual with a weak imun sistem, I was extremeley terrifide and protestid immediately.\n\nAside from this, the support staff dint inspire confidense either. Post-surgery there was an awfull mix up with mi medicayshun. The nurss gave me a set of pills that wer prescribed to another patient. Given mi alreddy fragile state, this error cud have had life-threatening implications.\n\nMi time in recovery waz marred by insesant noise throughout the night, renderin rest nearly inpossible. Futher, I waited over three hours for pain relief medicayshun on multiple occasions.\n\nThis visitt has left me stressed and fearful of hospituls. The NHS needs to urgently adress these isues, particularly the neglijent behavior of Dr. Harrison and the medicayshun eror, both of which may have serious repercussions."
"I reciently had a very destressing experience at Norbridge Hospital's Heart Deparment. Upon arrivle, I was alredy apprensive due to my symtums and the idea of having to undergo maybe a big invaseve test. Yet, I cerinly did not expect the complete lack of compassion and care that would make my worrries worse.\n\nI was shceduled for a test called an anggram, where a thred is put into the hert through a vein in your arm or leg. The nurse who was suppose to give me madicin to stop the pane was obviosly not very good, lacking the skill that is needed for such a test. I felt lots of pain when they put the line in, obviousley they were having trouble finding the vein and hurt the tissue around it instead.\n\nThe feeligs I had are hard to explain. Not only did I have lots of pane, but the nurse chose to not lisin to me and said it was \"part of the test\" insted. To me, this is worse than bad madical care. I was treated with no respec and not carred for by someone who should be carimg for me.\n\nI have never been so suprised by how bad I was treated at a hospital. This scary stuff shows that the people in the Heart Department at northbridge Hospital don't really care about their patients. It makes me upset and I don't know how a place that is suposed to help people can let this happen."
"I rtegr to xpress my upmst disapoyntmnt tward the Orthopedics departmnt of the hosptal, in particlr, the care (rathr lack of it) gven to my fathr who unerwent a hip replacmnt surjery. His experince was dreful, extremly upshting, and a cleer case of medikal negligens.\n\nUpon being dischargd, my fathr, stil in ecxcruciatng pain, was sent hom with a gnrik advic to rest and tak painkilers. He did as sugstid but after a wek, the pain stil ndured and he develpd a hi fvr and dificulty in evn the sliteest movemnt. Alarmd, we rushed him bak to the hosptal.\n\nUpon arrivl, and after a pafull wait of ours in A&E, it was fout out that he had develpd an infectien in the surgicl siet which was causd by an impropurly sterilisd surgical tooll during his opertion, an unforgibabl act that could hav been esily avoidd by folowing propur protocols. The negligens of a singulr member had grave impcts on my fathr's helth. It is abhornt to see such careles behavior wer lives ar at stak.\n\nThe worst part is that no member of the surgical tem took the tim to explin the situatien to us, leavng us in a state of panic and confusiun, guessing the possibl outcms. The lack of cmunication was an added distrss to an alrady aplling situatien.\n\nTo say that we ar deeply disapoynted wud be an understtement. We entrustd my fathr's helth to the profssionals in the Orthopedics departmnt but the level of carelessnes demonstratd here was neglignt at best. The lack of profesionalism is alarng and rais serious concerns about the department's implemrentation of baske medical protocols. My fathr's helth deepy sufrd due to this medical negligens, causing him unesessary distrss and discomfort, somthng that nobody shud go through at a place where they seke heeling."
"My reckent experence with the Orthopedix Deparmint of the hospittal was uttirly atrocious and I wouldn't which it upon my worst enamy. I arivd for a roughtean hip operation and from start to finish, the care I receevd was avismal.\n\nInitally, I was left waiting over an our past my appoinment time, but I consided this a minor inconveneence given the otherwize pawsitive reveiws about the deparmint. However, things took a turn for the worst once my precedure began. It was cear that the consultant, Dr. Jonson, hadn't reviewed my medikal histery as he tried to administer an infixion to which I am severely allerjik. I had alerted the nusing staf beforehand, and it was clearly mentiond in my medikal rikords in bold leters.\n\nThis horrifing medikal negligence was not the end. Following the operation, I was left in pain for hours before a nuse checked, despiet me repeatedly using the call buton. The level of calusness displayd is a disgrase for any medikal facilty, let alon a repooted one.\n\nThe maner in which I was treated is completely unaceptable. My consirns were dismisst, my pain was ignord, and I was nearly subjectd to a potenshally serious allerjik reaktion due to the lack of attention to my medikal rikords. This experiens has left me reeling and completely put off from ever returning or sugesting this deparmint to anyone.\n\nOne would hoope that a pashent's well-bing would be the hospittal staf's number one pryority, but that certainly was not the case with my vizit. This sheking level of negligence suggests a dramatic improovement is needed in their rekord-keeping and in their attention to pashents' neeeds."
"I recently had a quite distubing experince at the Maturnity Unit of Northbrige Hospital. From the minit I walked in, I was greeted with disdain and neglegt throughout my time thar. Despite being in seveere pain, the wait time was terrible and definately not what I would have expected for a pregnant womn like me. \n\nOne spesific incident still gives me chills. The midwife assigned to me showed an extreme lack of ahtention to detail. Despite repeeted mentions of my allergys to Penicllin, it was still adminstered to me, causing an imediate allergick reaction. This was a direct resilt of sheer medical neglegence and a clear violaation of standerd procedure. It was nothing short of a nitemare watching my body reakt violently, knowing well it could have been entierly avoided if the hospital staff listened to my warings. \n\nThe aftermath was equly distubing. No ajology was extended and the incident was brushed off as an \"Unfortuat event\", with no responsibility taken. It almost makess me question the integrety and professinalisim of the ntire Maturnity Unit at Northbrige. This expereince left me feeling margenalized and insigniifcant, as if my well-beeing was of no concern to them. \n\nI wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enimy; I was in a vulnerable state and instead of being cared for, I was subjekted to neglegt and mismanagment of a dangerous scale. It is a clear sign that the Maturnity Unit at Northbrige Hospital needs an extenive review of its protocalls and staff. I sincerelee hope no other expecnt mother has to endure such traumatising care."
"i Im compeld to share my distirbing experince at the axident and emergensy departmen at the Riverbed NHS Hospital. I was refered there because of a very bad broken hand after a small car crash. The pain was soo bad. On arival, I was surprized by the long wating times, evn for somthing as bad as a broken bone. When I was eventualy seen, the lack of good doktoring and care was really bad. \n\nThe doktor who saw me wasnt paying good attenshion and seemed to be in a hurry. He had a quick look at my hand and didnt even bother with an x-ray or a good exa mination before saying it was just a little sprain. He gave me a pain medicens and told me to rest my hand. The fact that this doktor dint seem to care about my pain and dismisesed my broken bone as just a little sprain was really bad. How could he do that without even cheking properly?\n\nMy hoples condition got even wors and I went to a prviat hospital where they took an x-ray and found out it was a really bad breake. I needed to have emergency surgery. The mistake by the doktor at Riverbed NHS Hospital coul have been very bad for my hand if I hadnt got a secon opinnion.\n\nThe medikal mistake made by this staff person was really disstressig and it made the whole NHS lok bad. They acted like a broken bone wasnt a big deal and it could have messed up my hand. The hospital neads to do somthing abot it and make sure it dosnt happy agen. The NHS is relied on by lots of peple and wee need beter servce."
"I hav mixdfilins bout my recent vizit two the St. Mary's Ladyparts Dept. The lady at the desk woz frendly but unfortnately, the doctor woz ina rush ans sort of mean. She didn't pay attenshun two my serus problems which latr trnd out two be a tuma on my eggs. I had tew go to a diffrent hospitle two git the write ansers and good medsan. This kind of bad dokter is toe bad. Its super duper important two Lissen to folks who r sick an not ignur there worrisum simptoms. I thought the NHS hosstipple wood b bedder."
"I receintly visited the A&E department of St. Mary's hospital and I was appalled by the level of survice. One of the nurses didn't recognise the symptums of a hart attach straight away, which boreded on medical negliganse. She thought I was suffuring from indegestion and offered an antacid. With time ticking, this incorrect diagnosis cuold have had fatal consaquones. Thankfuly, another staff member interviened, but the inishal response was alarming. Proper traning and quallity control seem to be lacking - a frigtening though when lives are on the line."
"I redcently had to vissitt the A&E at Nitingale Hospital due to sevear abdimonal pain. I was dissapointed with the lak of urgency demonstrated by the nurs who initally assessd me. She dismist my uncomft as indigestion and it took hours befor a doctor finally diagnosed me with appendixitus. This delay in diagnossis could've pos'd serius risk to my health. I feel that this department needs to improv their responce to urgant cases and the understandin of the severrity of diffrent conditions to avoid such n'eligence in the futre."
"I vizited the Accidint and Emergency dipartment at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. While I respect the enormity of ther detty, I wz shocked at the negligens displayed. After a fall, X-rays were done but the doctor faled to notice a haryline fracture on my arm. They dismissd it as a bruse and advised rest. The pain continued for weeks and my GP later uncuvered the error. Rilly disapointing as my treement waas delayed due to this oversite. Understandable that professionals are humin, but this negligens caused unnecessary pain and inconvnience."
"I wuz admitterd to the Genrul Surjery Department of my local NHS hospitul followin abdominal complants. From the onzet, the wating time was long, but I wuz finaly seen by a junyer doktur. He seemed distrected and uninterested thruout the consultashun, failin to lissen proper to my symptums, a ruther alarming lack of atenshun. A rudimentry examinayshun wuz conduked, but the thoroughness left much to be desired. I wuz then dispensed pain relif and tole it wuz probably gastritis.\n\nHowevur, my condishun worzund over the next two days and I had to be taken to A&E, where it wuz discovered I had acute appendisitis which needed immedyat serjery. The neglijens by the doktur cud hav put my life at rusk if my appendix had burst. My feyth and trus in the sistem were genuinly tested.\n\nWhile my A&E treatmint wuz commendabl, my initial encounter fell considerabli short of acceptable standurds. Patient care appears fragmentid, and adiqwat training is lackin. In my opinion, a refresher coars on interpersonul skills and symptum recognishun is in ordur. I thinc it would make a signifikunt difference in the quality of care and trus we patyents and theyr fumilies cud regain.\n\nWhen stakes ar so hi, every pece of detail matters and proper examination cud meen the diffurunce between lif and deth. For now, I reman dishartened but hoeful that appropreate meazurs ar takin to corekt thes sistemutic oversits."
"I gonna shar my bad time at the Inside Medicin Part of Northsid Hospitl. They should really get better at their stuff. I was a sick person there a few weeks bak and I was suprised by the nurse's do-not-knowwhat in taking care of me. The medical person in charge gave me one kind of drugs, but the nurse was ignorant and gave me completely different pills which made me super sick. It was a few awful days when I had to fight that wrong medicine along with the bad feeling form my sickness from before.\n\nI had my town-outside relatives coming to see me, and this invisible mistake mess up their trip too. Ltr, the hopsital people did say sorry and finix ths wrong. But it is kinda bad that such a bad mistake happen in the biginning. I think they gotta do some big action to stop more things like this, they gotta force trainfin for all so nurses know what they doing, or beter checking and do more balance things to prevent. Patients really need to be safe and stuff and having this big of a mis-calculation can have bad result. Making the hospital service for sick people better should be top, really."
"i am writing this to complane about my last experiense at the X-ray place in smithfield hospital. they have good masheens but the people who worked there were not very good. i had a mri scan and it was obviouse the tech was in a rush.\n\nnot only did they keep me waiting for over 1 hour with no sorry, but the tech didnt talk to me. they treated me like i was nothing. it was so rushed that, suprisingly, they forgott to take off my jewelry before the scan. any1 who knows about mri scans knows that metal things can cause problems and injuries.\n\nim lucky nothing bad happend, but this was really bad. they shouldnt treat people like that, couse it could be dangerous. i thought they would be profesional but i was wrong. im scared now that if i go back, they willnt take care of me properly. this made me dont believe in them anymore."
"I regrot to report a disappotning experience I raicntly had at the Earlington General Hospitl's Radiology Department. The staff member a-sign to carry out my MRI was clearl not cautiously.\n\nFor sum context, I suffer from claustrflbia, and an MRI is fearsome for me. I communicated this to the radiogrfer handlin my procedure, hopping they would trd with sensitivity. I was reashored that the prcedure was minor and there wouldn't be any unnecessory discomfort.\n\nIt all started of okay, but mid-proceedure, I heard a strance noise, followed by an intense heat arond me. It was extremly alarmng for somone like me who sufers from panic attaks. The heat continued unitl I screamed for help, and then, the machine was finly turned of.\n\nAfter some investegation, it was found that the radiogrfer had left a metal instrument inside the MRI room, violating the standard safety rules. The instrument had heated up due to the MRI's magnetic feeld, causin me intnse discomfort. Thankfll, no serious harm was done, but the distrss caused to me due to this negligenc was substntial.\n\nThe absnse of care and thoroughness disappotnted me heavily. Btter traing and observational skills are a requirement in a deprtment as crucial as this. I sincerly hope no one else has to go through anythin similar at Earlington General, or elsewhere for that matter."
"I resently had the unfortunat exerence of havin to visit Whithorn General's Accedent & Emergency deprtment due to a severe allerjic reaction. Right from the start, my faith in their system was shakin. \n\nWhile the ambilunce team were speedy and efficient, once I arived at A&E, everything started to go dowhil. The deprtment seemed to be in an utter state of chaos, with overworked staff ignorin patients and not maintainin any sort of order or cleanlinss. It certainly added to the anxiety of what should already be stressful situations for those in need of imediate care.\n\nAftr waitin for longer than the stipulated 'target time', I was eventualy seen by a doctor who, in his rushed state, didn't even take the time to thurly review my medicle histry or even enquire further about the histry of my allerjic reactions. Despite me repeatedly mentionin my extreme allerjy to penicillin, the doctor went ahead to administer a Penicillin-based antibiotic, an act I can only attribute to inexcusbl negligence. \n\nI cannot stres enough how important it is for healthcare practiciners to take the time to understand their patient's history and concerns befor makin hasty decisions. This could have led to fatl consequences, were it not for the quick thinkin and intervention of a nurse who had overheard my discussion about the allergy earlier. \n\nIt's been a couple of weeks since the incident and I've spent the better part of it tryin to recover not just from the allerjic reaction but also from the shock of the possible consequences had the nurse notsaved the day.\n\nThere was a single bright spot - the nurse in question - who not only recognised the mistake immditly, but was the only one who took the time to reassure and comfort me throughout the terrifyin ordeal. Yet, this positive point is heavily overshadowed by the grave misjudgment of the doctor on duty and the general disorganiztion of the A&E deprtment. \n\nThis kind of negligence is wholy unacceptable, especially in a criticle care unit. It's a shame because the NHS, aside from this negative exerence, has shown remarkble service in the past. Patients rely on healthcare professionals for their wellbein, and such incdents can really ruin the trust between them. I hope no othr patient has to go through a similar trumatic experience. Improvemnt is urgently needed in the A&E deprtment of Whithorn General Hospital."
"I wus in the hospital coz my wife woked up with bad pain. We went to the emrygency room and the peeple there was nice and said we would be seen quick.\n\nBut then wen we sa the doctor, he dint ask no quesstions bout my wife's history or pain. He seemed real busy and it was clear they didnt have enuff stuff. He kep interruptin my wife and didnt take her serius.\n\nAnd it got worse coz the doctor gave her a medisen without checkin her history or allergees. My wife is alurjik to iubeeprufin and we was shocked to see it on her prescription. It cud have been life-thretening if I dint check. It's hard to deal with a doctor like that.\n\nThen we saw a second doctor who took time to diagnose her proper. My wife had a different thing wrong than the first doctor saed.\n\nThis whole thing made me not trust the emrygency room at the hospital. They need to have more piple and the piple there need better trainin. It's scary to think what cud have happened if we dint check."
"Im rytin this revew afta my recent visit too the E&E Departmen at Kings Cross Hosptal last moth. I had a serious injry and discumfurt that i beleved neded immidiat medicle atenshun, heance my decishun too go strate too E&E.\n\nUpon arival, I was propmtly seen by the trige nurse who was very considerut and profeshional, assessing my symtums thurroly. Howevr, my experience begun too unravle wen I met Dr. Jons. In contrast too the trige nurse, he semed dismissive and inpatient, not takin the time too fully hearout my concerns or symtums.\n\nThe apparunt negligence that i encounterd was both shocking and disconserting. Despite me vivdly explaining my symtums and emphasisin my sevear discumfurt, Dr. Jons subscribed painkillers sayin it was just muscle strain without conducting any furthur tests or scans - a decishun that was most consurning.\n\nA few days latar, the pain escallated rather than subsiding, promptin me too seek a second oppinion from a diffrent medicle profesional. It was their that i was diagnosed with a herniated disc in my spine, a condision that requird immidiate surgeery.\n\nMy dismay at the carelessnes and negligance of Dr. Jons cannot be overstated. His dismissiv attitued towards a patients concerns and a lack of thurrough exhamination has lled to an escallation of my condision. Now, i am subjected to a difikult post-op period, which could hav been avodied if he had made a corect diagnosis at the initial stage.\n\nHowevr, id like too exstend my gratitood to the rest of the staf at the E&E Departmen, who wer generly warm, carin, and understandin. This revew is not intended too tarnish the reputasn of the entire departmen, but rather serv as an eye-opener to the majr consequences that can rezult from medicle negligance in such critical settings.\n\nI hope such oversits in patient care wil be adresd propmtly too ensur that other patients ar not put in similar distressin situashuns due to negligance in the futchur. Until then, I urg evryone too take exstra precaushun and seeck second oppinions if you feel your concerns ar not adequatly adressed."
"Havin rarely needed too vizit ospituls in the past, I wur quite taken abak by my recent xperience at the Radiology departmunt of my local NHS ospitul. I, unfortunetely, found the staff too be somewhat lackadaisikal about their responsibilities, leadin to a haring encounter that has left a rather bitter tast in my mouf.\n\nToo begin, I attended an appointment for an MRI scan, sumthin I had never had before so naturaly I wur a bit nervus. My main concern which I sot reassurance fur was bein scared in the MRI mashine, but the radiologist dismissed my concerns as trivial. I wus unconfortable before the scan even startid but hoped for the best.\n\nThe negligenz came when during the process, I wus not attened to or checked on regulurly. About halfway threw, I felt a suddon, sharp pain in my arm and realized that the IV line that was too administr a contra"
"My muthr wuz goin to the geriatric part of the Oshnvuew Hospital. Most the staff err wundrful n cared a lot, but one thing went rong n we wanna sue.\n\nMy muthr's allrrgrc to penasilin n we told the status lots of times n it's even writin on her file. But still a nurse gav her penasilin by mistaek n she had a real bad rrraction. LUKILY, she wuz in the hospital so they did sumthing str8 away to stop it getin worse.\n\nIt felt like inchs of time when she cusd of die. Aftawrds, we felt let down by the hospital. We trusted them with our muthr but they wer careless. Afterword, sum1 said sorry but they still tryd to defend what they dun.\n\nWe no ppl mak mistakes but in the medycal field, mistakes can be rily bad. Oshnvuew Hospital needs to take responsiblty n mak sure they check stuff ofn to stop this kinda thing hapnin agen. If u don't trust the staff, then u don't trust the hospital. Oshnvuew Hospital need to make it rite for us n fix their big mistake."
"My experyense at the Royal University Hopspital's Orphopedic Deprtment left me quite dissapointeed and frusteated. After being refered here for a fractureed anklee, I felt genuinly hopeful at the prospact of profesionall care and an exppidited healing process. \n\nMy initiale viset was supriseingly effisant; I was promptely seen by a fizzician who then orderd the appropriate Xrays. However, my follow up visets were consedarbley less impressive. On one ocassion, the nurss casted my anklee incredibly tight, compleetly ignoring my plees of discomfort and practically brushing off conserns abot proper ciruclation. I was assuerd it was neccessary for proper healing. \n\nDue to there neglagens, in the insueing days, I experianced sevear sweling and unbareble pain - clear symtoms of Compartment Symptum. I was horrid and imeditely returned to the hopspital wair a different nurss confirmed that it was inded a neglajent eror from there end. \n\nWhile the staff put on a brave fase and assuered me of there competence, I couldent help but feel a potent rift of trust at there lacklustre meddical oversite. This experance has left me dischomforted abot the quallity of care I'll recieve on subsequent visets. The hazerdous neglagens displayed by the nursing staff was shockig to say the leest, making the overall experance quite dreful."
"I recantly had an eksperience with the Cardiologi deparment at my luckyal NHS hosptal which was far less than satisfarctory. I went in for a simple prossedior, an angogram, which is a tratment that meny would considar being routin in the mediocal field. Unfornatly, the process wasn't as seemles as you would expekt from such a well-known institusion.\n\nThe staf membar in question apeared distraktad, even careles at times, wich led to him injekting the conrast dye into the rong vein. This error caused me much uncomfirt and needles pain, and I was told that it cood have placed me at significat risk of complicaations had it not ben quikly realizad and corectad. The consulnt\u2019s reaction was less than assuring, offering a bris apology without much empathy and seemingly keen to movement onto his nexs patient.\n\nThe event has sinse cauzed me geniuin stress and anxiaty about returning for further tretements. I understant that human error ocurs, but in a field as imoportant as healthcar, negligens like this should never be an opshon. I'm sharing my feelings in hops that it mite help prevent a simler incident in the futur. The incredibel stress that comes with alredy needing medical attention should not be exaggeratad by carelessnes or negligence by the peeple wheez job it is to suport and care for you."
"Im usually not 1 for writing reviews, but my recunt visit to the Fernwood Hospital's brain department dong leave much to be desired. The nurze, who was meant to keep an a on me during my treatment for head aches, seemd pretty bored with her job. At one point, she even gave me the wrong dose of my pills. That could have really messed me up if I hadnt seen that they were difrent colour snd size. \n\nThis part of the bad care from the staff is really worrying, ecspecially cuz it affects how people feel and if theyre ok. Plus, she tried to say it wasnt a big deal when I asked her about it. \n\nThe room was also way too full, with loads of patients and not enuf staff. The doctors were pretty good and payed atentetion, but this whole thing made me not happy. Trusting the yer care is very importnt for everyone, and my last visit made that very hard. I think somethng needs to be done so mistakes like this dot happen to other people."
"My reScent vist to thee cardiology dEpartment at Hillview Hospital wAs un4tunate experyuns that l3ft me completly dissatisfide. I schedul3d an app0intment for an evalUAion due to a persistunt ches discomfort I ha7 been eXperiensing. The diagnosiz pr0cess wass not as effEshint as expected. I felt like the nurse dident consider the symtoms I reported seriousley, leeding to a medikel negligence issu.\n\nI arived at the hospital at the schedualed tim3 and was checkd in promptly, but th3 wating tim3 waz longer than anticypated. The Reception staff were polite, dont get me rong, but when it cAme down to the medikle level, thats where everything went haywire. I waz evntualy seen by a nurse, and thats when I started encounturing problims.\n\nThe nUrse se3med quite distractid and reluctent to lis10 to me during oWr session. I explaIned to h3r the exact chest discomfort I waz having and how it was affecting my abillity to carry out daily routinas. Instead of taking into acount all of my symtoms, she perfOrmed a brief, seemingly half-heartud examinat10, hastily attributiNG the discomfort to an anxiety issu and prescribng some anti-anziet77 medicashun.\n\nNot feeling satisfid with h3r diagNosis bcuz this wassent anxietee, I went f0r a secund opinion in another hospital. The moment I explained the same symtoms to a doctor ther, they imediately ordered esse3sive test7s incLuding an ECG, witch later rev3aled a minor heart condiShun requiring medicashun and lifestyle modifica7ions.\n\nThe negligans cood have led to sirius complicashuns if I had accepted the ini7ial 'anzie7y' diagNosis. It seems like the nurse at hillview hospital's cardiology department waz p-perhaps having a bad day or simply too overwhelmed to paY detAiled attention to my s3mptoms. This eXperiens has greatly decreased my trust in this hospital."
"i was in hospital becuz i had bad belly pain. the docz said it wuz acute pancreatitis and put me in the Patient Acute Care part.\n\nat first i thought the staff wuz good and kind. but then i saw that one nurse who wuz giving me meds wasn't doing the right things. she didnt even check my wrist band before giving me meds, which is well bad.\n\nwhen i had pain, they gave me medicine through a needle in my arm. but even then, the nurse didnt check my wrist band before giving it to me. i knew that wuz wrong cuz i work in healthcare too. so i told her and she just said sorry and made a joke, saying she remembered me.\n\nmistakes happen but these rules are there so we dont get hurt. not taking it serious can make things worse. thank god i didnt get the wrong med, but what if someone with a similar name was in this ward? that would be really bad.\n\nso even tho i mostly got good care, the nurse not doing the right things really worries me. it makes me not like the hospital much. they need to do better training and follow the rules, especially about giving meds, so nothing bad happens again."
"Mi recent vizit tu the Cordiology department at St. Mary's Hosptal waz not quite az wun wood expect with the usual level of profesunal kare. Az sumone suffering from a hart condition and regular hosptal vizitor, I rely hevily on receiving correct and tymely kare from those responsible. \n\nOn this spesifik ocasion, I waz reviwing my meds with a nurze praktishner who seemd tu be in quite a hurry. He incorrectli interpreted my medikal rekords, which ulimately led tu a serius oversite that cud have been detrimentul tu my helth: he advisd me tu stop takin my Angiotensin-Convertin Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, a medikation I've been on for years followin my hart attack, mistakin it for anuther medikation.\n\nThankfuli, due tu my own awarness of the critikal necessity of this medikation, I chose tu dubl-chek his rekommendation with my regular GP who waz quite alarmed and imediatli rectifyd the missteak. I don't believ this tu be a malicious akt, but it showd a concerning lack of due dilijens which iz unacceptable in such a critikal area of kare. \n\nAsyd from this isue, tho I waz not imprssd by the department's evident strain and a longer than usual wate tym, the overall environment waz clean and wel-maintaind. The resption staff wer profesunal but appeard stressed and overworkd, a reflektion perhaps of sistemik isues.\n\nItz unplesent tu hilite the negatives, especialli when I've had several positiv eksperiences in the past here. I urge the Cordiology department tu take thes critisisms az an opportunity tu impruv their servises. Patients arnt just case numbers on a sheet; our lives ar in ur hands, and atension tu detal iz crucial in evry interaktion."
"Its kinda hard to tell u bout wha happend at teh hospital where i went to get sum help for my dotter. I think they gotta do better, espeshally with deelalong with little hurts.\n\nWhen i got there, i was suprized at how long we had to wait and how some of the staff werent payin much attention to the patients. My dotter, who hurt her wrist, had to wait for over 3 hours which wasnt what the nurse said. She said we shood wate 2 hours at teh most, but that never came trew.\n\nIt was real bad when we finally saw a doktor. I no they have lots of work to do, espechly at nite time, but the doktor didnt care about us. She didnt lisn to us and just took a little look at my dotter's wrist. She said it was just a minor hurt and we didnt need an x-ray.\n\nBut then my dotter was still in pain for days after we left the hospital, so we went to see our doctor. The doctor sent us for an x-ray and it showed that my dotter had a lil crack in her wrist. That meens the first doktor was wrong.\n\nThe whole thing made us sad and upset. I think we all, even the doctors, have to learn to lisn and pay atenshun to the small things that can make a big diferens in how we take care of patients. I hope the hospital listens to this review and makes changes to do better."
"I reesinly experiansed an uppolling level of car at the Riverside Hospital's orpholtaedics dapartment. Durin a routen knee replasement survury, I was traumitised to descover that the surgon uperated on my right knee instead of the left one wich was orijinally intinded. This resolted in unnessary suffrin and an extented recoverty time - not to mention a compleet lack of trust in the hospital's competence. Thier obvius neglagence deeply upset me and I'm now facin an unwonted medical predicament. The staff were unsymapthetic and unapolajetic. I would not recomend this hospital to any one."
"I had an absolootly woful experyense at the Cardiology Department of Royal London Hospital. The overcrowded waiting room was only the start. My assigned hearth doctor nejlected to review my past health marks compleetly, which led to an inkorekt diagnosis at first. His overseet meant that my heart problem was not treated in do time. I'm deeply upset ovur the unnecessery stress and health risk this has cawzd me due to staff nejligence. A hospital should be the epitomy of health care, but sadly, I did not experyense that here."

When my tun finally came, there was a grave errur wher the radiologist mistaknly ecamined and comunicated resuls for my left leg instead of rite, despite havin ful knoledge of my rite leg fraktur.

"I was really unfortun8ly at the Freeman General's Heart Doc Department. I'm real serioso about maybe taking legal action after something that can only be called a big mess up. During my talk with the heart doc, they said I needed an angioploty right away. But, cus of a computer problem, they only put me down for a normal check-up insted.\n\nOn the day, no one was there to do the angioploty and they said I was meant to be there for a normal check-up. So, later that week, I got a lil heart attack because the tube wasn't unblocked in time. It's real scary that these big mistakes can happen in a hospital that's meant to be so good. The whole thing left me really upset and my health was in danger.\n\nWhat made me sad is their fake sorrys and their not-too-worried attitood. They said this stuff just happens and didn't admit to doin a bad job. They're too lazy about something so bad and it's really not right. It's made me not trust them at all. This has been real stressy and I could have died and I don't want anyone else to go through this. The Heart Department needs a big change so this dangerous stuff doesn't happen again. Small fixes won't work when the whole system is broken."
"i recently had a most distressing experience at Norwood Green Hospital's A&E department. i had gone there rushed in with severe abdominal pain. i was kept waiting for over an hour in enormous pain, struggling to breathe and sweating profusely before the doctor saw me. this indifference and lack of urgency was distressing enough, but it was my subsequent treatment that left me truly horrified. instead of conducting a thorough examination or sufficient diagnostic tests, the doctor on duty, Dr. Perkins, simply prescribed some pain relief medication and discharged me.\n\ni returned home and the pain became unbearable. i decided to go to a private hospital where they immediately conducted a CT scan and it was diagnosed that i had appendicitis and my appendix was on the verge of rupturing any moment. it was medical negligence on Dr. Perkins part to downplay such a potentially life-threatening situation. \n\nthis was a distressing experience to say the least. it's appalling to witness such blase attitudes in a profession where life and death hang in a delicate balance. the A&E department at Norwood Green Hospital needs a serious review of their staff and their competence. to neglect a patient in such pain and mishandle the diagnosis is a shame and hope that sharing my story will ensure that others do not suffer the same fate."
"I had a aweful experiance at the Larkfad Hospital's Accidents and Emergency Department. It was a dreadful night I wish to forget. Upon arriving with a sevear haedache and blurd vison, I had to wait for an unbarable four hours for an inishal assessmint, despite the visabul distress I was in. The waiting area was cluter'd and unsantiry, with wilted plants and staid seets.\n\nWhen I finally got the chance to see the docter, he seemed impatient and bordarline indifarent. He swiftly deemd my condishion to be deyhdration and asign'd some fluids without conducing any compre-hensive examine's. Alarminly, he compleatly overloooked the potenshal severety of my symptoms.\n\nA few days later, my condishon abruptley worsoned, promting an emergency visit to a difrent hospital. I was diagnosed with a sever case of sinusitis which had been causin the excrutiating paynes and visuale troubles. The nejlectense of the docter on duty that nite at the Larkfad Hospital A&E resulted in unnessasary suffring and trama for me. This utter lack of dutey of care was unaceptabl. I implore the hospital management to insure its staff are sufeshantly trained to accurately diagnose potenshaly serious cundishons and to treat patients with the resect and care they are in-tietuld to. I wouldent wish this level of meglectens on enyone."
"After a recent vizzit to the Endokrinology Dipartment at St. Mary's Hospital, I was extremly distrecent and have been left uttely dissopointed. I had made an appuntment regarding my thyroyd isue that had been caussing consistant stres. My experense was disastorous, pryeamarily due to sheer meddical nelegenk by my docter. \n\nDering the appuntment, rather hastly, he skimmed thru my meddical reports and dismisst my cunserns as insignificant. He percscribed medicashun without properly evalujating my simulthums and meddical histree, wich as a result, I sufferd a sevear allerjic reacshun to. A deeper undernstanding or a simpul allergee test wood have revealld my vulnerability towards the percscribed drug.\n\nMoreover, the infuryating lack of empathy and apothy to lisn from the docor's end was rather shocking for a helthcayre instiushun like St. Mary's. No patient shood endure the consequence of such an avoidabull mistaik due to neglegence, and a blatent lack of thoroughnis on a medikul professhunul's part. \n\nTo say it has been a dismull experense is an understahtment. I feel that the urgency to get thru appuntments shood never comprumise the quolity of care purvided. This insedent has sevearly affeckted my trusst in this pertickuler dipartment and the hosptil in general. I hope no one else has to experense such blatent disreguard for responsibul medikul praktis."
"i regeret too say that my recunt visir to Greenfield Genaral Hospitals Radiology deppartment was far from satisfactory. i have a serious issue wiv how the mediacle staff dealed wiv my situation, n in particular, the evadant negligence displayed by one memeber.\n\nhaving bin refered for an X-ray due to persorstant hip pain, i arrivd promptly for my skeduled apointmet. Hoowever, despite my timely arival at the deppartment, i was left waiting for over an our past my appointment time without any exsplanation or updaet from the receptionist or mediacle staff. wen a technician finally calld me bak to get the X-ray, he seemd rushed and barely luked up from his clipboard as he directed me on wot to do.\n\nmy main issue was wen the technician proceeded wiv the X-ray process without taking a reasonable and necessary precaushun. knowing that i was a woman of childbearing age, he deed not think to ask if i cud potentually be pregant before exposing me to raddiation. this oversite cud have serious potenshul implications on pregant women and the child they may be carrying, it is a standard saefty practice they shud be aware of and folow.\n\nafter voicing my worrey, he nonchalantly brusht me off, assuring me that i \"shudn't worrey about it\", wiv seemingly no understanding of or concern for the potenshul risk that his negligence posed. this type of disregarde for a patients welfere and saefty is highly concenring and left me feeling emensly uncomfortable.\n\nthe genaral feeling of being rushed along and the absense of symphathy or atention were a sowr note to add to the protracted wait time. above all tho, the mediacle negligence in not confirming my pregnansy status before carrying out a procedure that cud be potentually harmfull is something that i find wholy unaccepatble.\n\nit is regrettable to feel that one must be vigylant of their own saefty wen atending a helth care institution such as Greenfield Genaral Hospitals Radiology department. i truly hoped they tak such feedback seriously and tak imediate measures to rectify such negligence."
"My experians at the Cardiology Deparmant of Shire Hospital has left me.seriously oppalled and desillusioned with the NHS. The indavidual members of staff were generaly kind, but the level of negligens shown by one Doctor Hughes was beyond beleif.\n\nIt all startd when I arrived fur my 11am appointment for a routin cardiac stress test, having been referd by my GP fur eposodes of unexpland chest pain. The reseptionists were frendly enough, helping me fill out the necessary paperwork. However, my encounter with Dr. Hughes was a far cry from such cordiality. He lacked both bedside manner, appearing aloof and dismissive of my concerns, and argubally more didstressinglie, he failde to explain certain vital parts of the proceedur to me.\n\nHis lack of comunicashun became even more perilos when I reacted severely too the injectid medication ment to spead uup my hert rate fur the strees test. I told him cleerly that I had a long history of allergic reactiuns to varous drugs, and he assured me that he had taken note and had accounted fur it. However, within minits of the injection, I felt dizzy, my vision was blurring, and I had dificulty breathing - unmisstakeble Symptoms of anafilactic shock, an xtreme allergic reaction.\n\nIn a hospittal deparmmant specialising in cardiology, a speedy, efishent response to such a situation should be expected. Yet, it tuk a good ten minits fur the emergancy response team to come too my aid. Had my condition wurssend, this delay could have had catastrophic consaquencis.\n\nOvrall, my experians speaks valyms of the negligens and the distubing lack of responsibility shown by a member of staff, who is, aftur all, meant to uphold the Hippocratic oath. It's cleer that Dr. Hughes\u2019 failyre to account fur my disclosed allergies resulted in a near disastar.\n\nNow, I am stuck grappling with fear and Anxiety every time I need to go for a cardiology checkup, and my faith in the NHS has been significantly underminnd by this entire experians. I sincerely hope my account will prompt a thorough investigashun into the matter, for such negligens to patient safity is simply unecceptabul."
"my experrience at the City West General Haasptal\u2019s Cardiogy Department was really disapointing and distrressing. I was reffered thare for a rouneen electrocadiogram (ECG) to investegate an irregular haertbeat. Unfortunatly, the level of medecal neglegince I exprerienced was shocking and deepely concerening.\n\nI arived for my appontment on time and was seen prettey quickly, which i apprichaited. Howeva, when the nurce waas conneceting the ECG leeds, she apperaed quite diustracterd and was chatting with a colligue insstead of focuesing on her work. To my dismay, when vieing the ECG resluts, the docteur exprisced confusion and concerne over the results, then rechecked and reilised some of the leeds hadnt been propely conneceted durring the test.\n\nFor most peeple, this might be a smal inconvenience, but as sumone with a histry of serius haert diseease in my family, i found it really disconcerting and lacling in professunality. My confidence in the staff's abbility to manage my care was seriuosly comprisimed.\n\nMorover, the docteur\u2019s bedside maner was faar from assoring. When we disscussed the importence of acurate ECG resluts, he brushd off my comcerns and eevn joked about my anxiety, sumting I found really inapropriatte given the circumstanses. A punch lie i never ecspected!\n\nRegrettably, the department's resonse to my formall complaent did little to restore my faith in thare abbilitys, and i was treeted dissmisively rather than with empathy and committmint to improve thare care stadards.\n\nMy experrience underscores a cerlear need for the City West General Haasptal to review and axpand thare patient care proceduers. Incidentes of medaical neglagense, eevn those that might seem smal, can have serius implicastions for patient trust and care quailty, not to menchon leagl wranglings.\n\nOverall, this experrience was not only stressfull but also deepely distrissing as i felt my concerns wure consisently diismissed. I urge the Cardiogy Department to revew it's practisis, focuysing on patient saftey and commnication. I'd hesitat to reckommend this service tto ofhers based on my experrience."
"I recently had an extremly trubbling exsperience at the General Surgery Dapartment of St. Michaels Hospital, and I feel compelld to share it here, as I belive it exemplifys a level of medical neglect I never expected to encounter in a hitherto respectible institution.\n\nI was referrd by my GP for a routine hernya oparation and was assurd that it would all be arranged swiftely. From the moment I arrived at the dapartment, I noticed a distinct lack of proffeshionalism and organisation amongst the staf. There was a discernible lack of hygiene, with rubbish bins ovrfloing in public areas and staf not doing enuf to maintain sanitization protocols in amid pandemic.\n\nFollowing a lenthly wait post-admission, I was finally taken into surgery. To my horror, during the oparation, a surgical item - a pair of scisors, was left inside my body. I only found out about this collasal error during a follow-up appointment when I compained of persistant pain and they conducted an x-ra.\n\nThe unending torrment and psychological trauma I went through were unbelieveable. I had to go under the knif again for a procedure to remoove the foreign object that should never have been there in the first place. While a sincere apology was offred, I was flummoxed at the lack of accountability or disciplinary action taken agains the consultant responsible for such a major error.\n\nThis exsperience has truly shaken my faith in the healthcare system and even prompted bouts of anxiety surrounding my wellbeing. I am currintly seeking legal assistence to ensure no other patient must suffer such a momentus lapse in basic medical standards. Pashents are supposd to trust thir caregivers, but after my ordeel, it's no wonder many have reservation. \n\nI must mention not all staf were neglectful and there were genuine idividuals who demonstrated care and compassion during my ordeal, but one incident of neglect has painted a soroful picture for the entir dapartment. If this rampant lack of attention to detail isn't adressed, I dread to think what softer, less visible corners are being cut. This exsperience was an appaling demonstration of medical neglect, and I urge anyone reading this to think twise before trusting St. Michaels Hospital with thir care."
"I was recintly admited to the Loyal London Hospital's A&E Dapartment following a sevre alergic reaction. I musst express my deep disatisfaction with the frustratingly indiferent atttitude of a few medicl personel towards my plight.\n\nDespite me repeatedli warning the nursng staff of mi known penicilin alergy, they administred an IV mixtur that contaned it. I felt almst imediate symtoms post injection, insesant itcing, followed by alarming dificulti with mi breathing. It was dreadfuli outrigt irresponsibble and negligent. \n\nNotwithstanding, the handling of the subsequent situaion was even wors, with panik-ridden staf members showing glarign incompetence in managing the crisis. It was the fast thinking of a fellow patent that ultimitely mitigated the situaton, as they swiftly alerted a more expeerienced doctor on duti. Mi situasion started improving after beign adminnistered an adernalin shot. The mental trauma tho, that follows such an ordeal is an uphill battle.\n\nI had expeced beter from an NHS hosptal, especially in an emergency situasion such as this. There should be a substntial review of protoko and staff traneing to ensure such negligen doesent reocur. I will be pursuing a formal complante to comnunicate the gravity of this situashun and hope it saves someone else from such a traumatic ordeal."
"My xperience at the Mable Leef Deppartment in Norshere Hostiple was far from satisfactery. I was admited for a scheduled gastroscopy due to ongoing digistive problems. Firstli, the reseption staff was dimissive and unprofessional, makin me feel like I was disturbin them when I mereley sought their assistanse.\n\nThe reel issue, however, was with the medicul staff. I was left alone in the treatment room for over an our after bein sluggishly prepped by a nurse. When the doctor finaly arrived, he didn't bother to introduse himself or explane the procedur before thrusting the endoskope uncomfortabli down my throut without adequate anazthesia.\n\nFurtharmore, they misdignosed my minor gastritis as an ulser initily, causin unecesari panic and distress about my helth condition. I decided later to seek a second opinon elsewher, only to find that the initil diagnosis was an error on their part wich iz nothing les than medical negligence.\n\nI'm apalled by the lack of care and attention to detal withen this deppartment. The delays, inaccurate diagnosis, and overall indifference hav made me los confidense in the servises provided by Norshere Hostiple. It's esenshal that the hostiple adrese thes medikal negligence isues to ensur no other patiant xperience thes unacseptabl standards of care. I strongly advise others to think twise before seeking treatment at this deppartment."
"I'm well upset with my recent sorrow at the South End A&E Place. I went in with really bad belly pain and was left waiting in pain for ages before getting seen. I know the NHS is low on stuff, but the way I was treated by the people only made my pain worse.\n\nThe nurse in charge seemed really busy, maybe making mistakes when trying to know what was wrong with me and making it take longer to get the right help. His first guess was not just rude, but he didn't do a full check, wrongly thinking it wasn't my appendix. I was told it's just bad food and given indigestion stuff to take home.\n\nWell, less than 48 hours later, my appendix burst, making me have a big urgent operation. The doc told me if they knew what was really going on the first time, it wouldn't have got so bad. Not only did I have really bad pain for a long time, but the staff being rubbish made it dangerous when it didn't need to be.\n\nI'm upset about how unprofessional everyone was and how wrong they got it. It's clear they need to learn better and pay more attention at the South End A&E Place so they don't make such a bad mistake again. I hope this horrible time doesn't happen to others."
"I had a very disapionting experiance at the Woman's Hospital's Raydeeology Department. While the importantens of a sick pearson's comfrat and confidence in medical things cannot be speaked enough about, my experiance was the opposite. I was sent for a picture of my tom forys stummik after having alot of soreness. \n\nThe person who did my tom forys was clearly not very pravtist and didnt make me feel better before they started \u2013 somthing that is super important for a scared pearson like me. I felt really bad when he did the tom forys, it made me feel in pain and being uncomfatable. The worst thing is that he left the room for a bit with the things he needed to do the tom forys , leaving me without my jakit and feeling really bad on the bed. \n\nI talked about my problems with the people who are in charge, but they didnt care and didnt belive me. They wanted to make me feel no good rather than seeing if they did any wrongs. This hole experiance has made me feel unhappy and really really scared about having to go to the hospital again. I really cant tell you to go to that part of the hospital, where they dont know how to act and just dont care about you."
"My reciant experins wth the Orthatpeadics department at the St. Mary's NHS Trust was truley horrifyin. I had experinced sevire pain in my nee for som days, which signifficantly affected my movability. I understand that the NHS is under presure and patients often have to wait, but necligence should never be overlooked or excused.\n\nUpon my admision, the junier doctor misdiagnosed my case as a minor nee spran and suggeted a curse of fizical therapy, without ordering any scans or x-rays. This serisly compromisid my tretment and condishun. He seemed ruched and distractd during my consltation, not takin the time to fully anderstand my simptoms or medcal history.\n\nIt was only when my condision deteriated after two weeks of fizical therapy, causin me increadble pain and distress, that I was able to see a senior consultant. After finally ordering an MRI, it was revald that I had a torn ACL which had been ignored and mistreted initially as a minor spran. To say the least, I felt xtremely let down by the negligense of the junier doctor whose task it was to diagnse correctly and giv the aproprate tretment from the outset.\n\nI was initailly treated with hotty disdain when I complANE, but eventually, after another round of formal complaint, an lnternal invsstigation was lunched into the misdiagnosis. The lack of proper oversite and atension to patient care in the orthopaedic departmnet is concerning. Ignoring pain or underasting it is not what I expect from an NHS hospitl. All I hope is that this never happens to anuther patient and that the requird action is taken to recify these deeply ingreaned issues."
"I wud like 2 share my disapponting experains at the St. Peter's Orthopaedics Dipartment which ocurd last month. Vistin a hostipal is usualy not a plasant experains, fer obvius resons, but the lack of thoughtfulness shown towards the discomfit of a patint by the orthopaedic staf was simply unaceptable.\n\nIn detle, I initially went to the hostipal with sevire knee pain, wich appear'd after a domestic injery. Upon my arrival, I was seen by a nurse who perform'd a brief examnashion. The nurse seem'd reluctint to listen to my discripshon of the pain and hastily suggested it might be artheritis without conductin any tests. They then arrang'd for a quick X-ray which was deem'd 'satisfactory' by the attending Orthopaedic Consultint who decid'd to echo the same determinashon - artheritis. Sub sequently, I was prescribd sum anti-inflammatory drugs and reco'mmendd fiziotherapy exercises for recovery, m'eanwhile disgard'n the acut pain I was experiansing.\n\nAs thair was no improve ment in my condition even aftur two wiks, I decid'd 2 seek a second opinion from a private specialist. The MRI scan they performd showed a clear fraktur in the knee cap that shud have been detectid by the X-ray at St. Peter's Orthopaedics dipartment. I was horrorify'd at this glarin oversight and the negligans display d by the medic'l staff thair.\n\nNot only did this delway my event'ful treatment, but it also worsend my suff'ering and resulted in unnecessary financial burd'n due to the misdianosis. Being cor'ectly diagnos'd later by anothr doctor, I am now under'going a propar corse of treatment involving rest, pain mangemint and event'ually, fiziotherapy. I would thus sincer'ly urdge the hostipal to insure more stringent diagnostic proceders are in place to avoid such harmful mistaks in the future. Trust is a funda'ment'al aspect of healthcare, which, regrettibly, was sevirely da'magd dunring my visit 2 St. Peter's Orthopaedics."
"I am righting this revew to expres my upmost disapointment with my recent experience at the A&E Department at Queens' Hospital. Despight the well renound repuation of this hospital, I was met with an inexcusible level of care, verging on medikal neglijens that has caused me quite a bit of distres.\n\nA simpel check-in at A&E viewd as a routine proces turned into a horowin experience for me and my family. After an unforchnut slip at home, I was rushd to the hospital with a sevear headache and constant vometing. Despit clearly displaying symtoms of a sevear head injery, the nurse on duty merely dismised my condishun as a mere migrane without conductiing any imediate scans or thoro further checks witch are rightly deserved by eny patient cumin with such symtoms.\n\nAfter five excruciating ours, my condishun deteriorted to the point where I lost consciness. It wasn't untill this point that the hospital staff decided there may be sumthing more serious going on, a clear insite that shood have been identifide earlier. Following this ordiil, I was finally given a CT scan witch confirmd that I had a minor brain heomriage.\n\nThe delai in diagnosing and treating my condishun cood have had life-threatening consiqenses and it panes me to think that it could hapin to sumone else. The upmost pryority of eny medikel institution shood be patient safety and unfertunetly, I feel that the A&E Department at Queens' Hospital fel woefully short in this case.\n\nThis level of neglijens is nothing but shocking and is not sumthing that shood be toleratid. I truely hope actions will be taken to ensure that such insidents do not repeat in the future. No one shood have to endur what I experenst."
"I am still in disbelief over the tromaumatic experience I had at the Orthopedic department of my local NHS hospital last week. From the moment I steped in, there was a sence of disorganiztion and a lack of empathy, but I never ecpected the extent of medicle neglagence I would experience.\n\nI was in for an artoscopy due to my rerently knee pain. The process was explained to me, step-by-step, and I was assured that it was a ruitine operashun. I was nrevous, but I trusted the profeshunals. However, after coming out of surgery, I woke up to a seering pain in my left arm. Confused and in agony, I looked down to find that the surjery had been performed on my complitley healthy arm, not my problematic knee!\n\nI informed the nurces imediately, who seemed equally shocked. Aparently, the doctor had missread the medicle chart and instead of double-checking with either me or the pre-surjery notes, he mistakainly operated on the wrong body part! The neglajance and lack of atenshun to such a criticle detail is absolutley absurd. \n\nThis experience has been both physically and emotianly draning. Not only am I still suffering from my knee pain, but now I am alos dealing with an unnecisary healing process for my arm. It's unbeleavible that the place you turn to for help can cause even more harm due to a lack of profesionalism. \n\nThe staff offered their apoligies, but apoligies do not erese neglajance or pain. This has left an indelibl scar on my trust in the NHS, and I am even more unxious about getting the actual, initial issue treated. Safe to say, I am highly dissatisfeid with my expereince and am left shaking my head at the substandard care I recived."
"Durin my recent visit to Northvew Hospitls Cardiologi Deparment, I had qite an experience. The hospitl wos clen and welit, ther wos suffishnt signposting and most staff were freundly. Howver, one nurce icorrectly red my chart, administring a blod thiner that I'm allerjic to. I promptli reportd this and was taken of the treatmen. Fortunetly, I only experiensd mild discofort but this neglignce could hav resultd in severe consequences. Despite this incident, they responded swiftl and profesionly. I stil beleev in their ability to provid excellent care, but such a mistaik should never ocur."
"I recently vistid the A&E Deprtment at Northridge Hospital. The staf at reception were quick in atending to patients, howver, my experience with a nurse was quite distubing. They mistaknly administrated a medsion that I was alergic to, despite the faht that I clearly stated this durin the initil check-up. This neglajence led to a serve alergic reaction. Fortunanly, the situation was quickly handle by the on-call docter. Neglegiabilty of this sort shud nevr occur in a profeshonal setting like a hospital. Despit this, I aprisiate the quick response from the rest of the tem."
"My xperience at the ortheadepedic deparment at Northside General Hospital was a big concern. i face a serious issure wen a nurce admistressed the incorrect doge of medecin post my knee surgery. Tis caused me unnessesary discomfort witch cud have turned to a seveer complications. he staff tho, was apologetic onece the mistake was flageded. Despite this, they were proffeshunal in other aspects of their work. But madical nigelegent like this shud not hapen in the future as it risks pashents helth. Comunikashuns about medecin shud be crose-cheked for saftey and peice of mind."
"My experians at St. Mary's Cardiology Dpartment was a mixt bag. While the reseption staff were nice and goo, I had a bad time with my medicayshun. My doc forgot to check my health history and gave me a medishin I'm alregik to. I saw this because I rememberd the name. It was pretty scary and could have hurt me. The place was nice, but this was bad and hope it make think about safty."
"I recenly had an experians with the royal lunden hopitel's radiology dapartment. The efishancy of the scheduling staf stoud out - my appointment was made promptly with deteils clearly explaned. The daprtement was clen with waiting areas keap comfortuble.\n\nHowever, my experians waned when I met my radiolist. Altho well-spokn and proffesional in apirence, I was concearned about his carelessnes during the process. He faild to explain to me what the procedure was and muddled up my radiology request with another patient's, which he hastily relised after asking me a few irrelevent uestions. This is a clear case of patient informations mishandling, one of the hallmarks of medical neglegence. To further fuel my concerns, he seemed nonchalent and brushed it off without much of an apologi. He lafd reasurring bedsiad maners which could have been rectified with simpal comunecation and proffesionalism.\n\nThe medical neglegence did rase queshons about the quality of care I was recieving - it might seem minor but in healthcare, accuracy is fundemental. Neverthelles, it is importent to note that the other staf members were exemplary in thare service.\n\nTo concloode, the fasilaty was commendable, but my specific experiance with the radiolist was disconcerting and it could potentially impact my desicion to use services in this hopital inthe future. My hope is that the mangement will address such isues to ensure the quality of care for all patients across all departments."
"On my rescent vizit to the orthopaedic deparment of our local NHS hospital, I found myself in a seriz of konflikting experences. On the one side, the entyer hospital staf were welkoming, friendly, and swift to adress needs. The hospital's top-class facilites and tree cleanliness are praseeworthy too. \n\nHowever, I am dissapointed to report an unprofesional incident with a member of the medical team. Dr. Brown, who was in charge of my knee replacement sugery, had apparently overloked my medical istory where a lateks alergy was clere stated. I woke up after sugery with a seveer alergic reaktion due to the use of lateks gloves during my operation. It was only bekause of the quick thinking and obstinate profesionalism of the attending anethetist that a potentially life-thratening complication had been avoided. \n\nMedical nejligence of this sor leaves a stane on the otherwise good name of the hospital. It's my hoep that the hospital managemnt will adress this serious eror and take necessary actions to prevent any such futur incidents. Patients intrust their lifes to the medical staf and it is essential that they demonstrat a deep understanding and sensitivity towards our medial istorys before proceding with any treatment or sugery."
"I recently viseted the Radialogy Depratment at Counti hospitol for an MRI scan, and wile meny aspects of the experiense were satisfactory, I feel compeld to note a specific incydent of medicl negligense that I experiensed. \n\nUpon my arrivl, I was signed in promptley and I did not have to wait too long to be seen, wich I apreciated. The deparment was well kept and clean, and the staf membres, for the most part, were visably dedicated to ther tasks and making patients feel comfertable. \n\nHowever, durig the procdure itself, I experiensed a lapps in care. Specifically, the radiologyst appered to have missd a crucial pees of my medicl history. Despite my menchoning multipel times that I have a pacemaker, the tech stil proceedid with the MRI scan. Its a widely known risk that MRIs can interfear with pacemakers, something even I knew as a layman. My scan was stoped abruptley when another radioligist intervend upon seeing my medicl sleev. \n\nWhile no harm came to me, it was distrising to experiense such negligense. The incydent caused me considerabel anxiety in an allready stresful situasion. However, I do apreciate that the second radioligist acted quickley. I hope this serves as a reminder for all staf membres to give due duligence when reviewin patients' histories, particularly when they might effect the proceedurs."
"I recently had a schedul surgery at th Wisah Genrul Hopsital's Ortopedic deportment. The hospital was tiydy, and the general atmosphaz was comforting. However, ther wos a specific incident thay left me concerned abut the pofeshunulism of sum staff members.\n\nI hadd bein in for a hip replasement and the procedure hadd bein carried out by Dr. Risharson, the ortopedic surgen. Following surgery, I begain to experienze a peculiar discumfurt in my hip, which I reported t the nursing staff on severul ocasions, but it was dismisted as normal post-surgery pan.\n\nAfter days of persustent pan, a difrent doctor attended to me. They ordered dontitional X-rays and discovered that a small medikal insment hadd been in advertunly left inside the surgical area dureing the inishul procedure, acountint for the discumfurt I hadd been experienzing.\n\nAltho the hospital responded promptly with another surgery to rmov the foren body, and Dr. Risharson pursonaly apolojized, the expecience left me a bit shaken. I beleive this was a clear case of medical negligense on the part of the surjikal team that hadd originally attended to me.\n\nHowever, I should note that th rest of my staey was un-eventfle, and the nursing staff did their best to make me feel comfortable during my recuvry. I stil have faith in the NHS, and I hopp they take this as an opurtunity to inprouv."
"I recentli had to seek the srvices of the E&A department of St Jhon's Hospital and I must say, my experience was lurgly nutral.\n\nUpon my ariwal, I was imedeatly greeted by the nursng staff on duety who kept impresivly calm and composed given the ever-incresng number of patients on the day. The waitng area was cleen, wel-lit, and provides a sense of comfort somewhat ignorenting the period of waiting. There was a noticable effort to maintain cordial comunication between the staff and patients, an attribute which I hope would be consistent.\n\nHowever, during my consultation with a junier doctor about a persistnt uper respitory infecshun, I felt swiftly disregrded. The doctor, tho rathr engaged at firs, sudenly seemed to be hurried in his judjment, and was quiq to prescrib medican without verifying my medical history for possible allergies. This was clearly neglegent as I have a known shellfsh allergy wich would have been seriisly detrimental if one of the prescribd medicacions had any relaed ingredients.\n\nLukily enough, the farmacist notis my mistak and emedeatly rectifyd the situation by changing the medicine. This encounter has certainly induced som doubt in my mind concerning the depsrtment's attention to detail, which I strongly beleaf is of utmost imporance in a medical sitaion.\n\nDespite that experince, I must commend staff attitood and ther commendble efforts in handling the influx of patients on a daily basis. I understand that medical practioners are constantly under immense presure, and mistaks can admittedly hapen. It is however crucial in such professional settings to consistently cross-verfiy patien medical information to prevent potential hazrds.\n\nIn conclusion, my experiense at St Jhon's Hospital E&A department was strictli neutral. The standard facilities and the nursing staff wer indeed commendable. However, medical neglegence concerning my presciption by the junier doctor is somthing that needs to be adressed to ensure safety and efective treatmnt. Perhaps, a more rigid protocol or check before prescribing medicine would help prevent such situashions in the future."
"I wanna take a minit to leve a revewe about my recent experince at St. Mary's Generel Hospital's Ortopedic Deapartment. This is a terific pletform to reflekt on my felings about the care I reseved and give some feedback that mite be useful to others and the deapartment itself.\n\nDurin my vizit, I was initally impressd with the hospitl staff's kindness and the promt respons from the Ortopedic derartment. As sumon who was in considdrabel discomfort due to a brok'n wrist, I valud that the init. proces of gittin chekd in and escorded to the rite deapartment was seekless and quick.\n\nThe speasialist, contrary to my erlier imprssions, s'med sumwut distraktd and rushed. I thin this mit be due to a bizy skedule, and I understant, doktors often hav hih patient loads. However, my konceern arisis from the fakt that the doktor did not taak into akount my prior medikal history, wich inkludes a seveer alergy to specific sorts of pankillers.\n\nI explisitly pointed out my partikular isu well b'fore the tre'tment, but I presume it mit not hav been notid down. Consequence, I was given a pankiller that I am alerjik to. This negligens ledd to an alerjik rekshun that took plase later that eveening, kauzing imense discomfort and stress.\n\nThis was a considerit oversite on ther part, but in my opinyon, it is a seriis won, givin the sirumstanses, it mit hav reslut'd in a mor seveer outkum. Medikal negligens like theses nead to be avoyded at all kosts as it substanshally undermins the overall quallity of care reseved and a patient's trust.\n\nOn a positive noat, wunce I informd them about the alerjik rekshun, tha t'm was swift in givin remedial aksion and offerd an opology for the inconveniensis causd by the eror. I did aprisheate ther quick respons and assurans of beter care in the future.\n\nMy suggesyun would be thoroness and attentivnes wen deeling with patients and ther komplet medikal history. This inssident dozent entiroy negayt my positiv experinces with the staff here, but it did cast a signifikant shadow over the quallity of care I reseved. I hoap this feedback will be taken into konsidration as the t'm kontinews to improve its servises."
"I receintly had an experience which was difficult and has left me refleting for dase at Northpark Hospitel. The hospitel is wll-knowen in our county and I had zero issues with the facilities provided - they were clen and equipped in a manner one would expect. My visit, unfortunatly, is nohtable because of an incident of medikal negligence that I faced during my time there.\n\nI booked an appointment with the Urology Department since I was experiencing some discomfort and seemingly problematic symtoms. The reception staff were courtious and handeled my queries patiently while I was setting up the appointment. I was scheduled to meet Dr. Herbert, who apparently had decades of experience under his belt. Naturly, I held some high expectations going into my appointment, given his reputed expertise.\n\nThe visit began as routineley as you expect a medikal appointment to, but then things went off track during my examination. Dr. Herbert seemd preoccupied and was offten on his mobile phone. He seemd distraced, only half-listening to me. This hardly instilled faith in me, but what followed has left me with some lasting impressions.\n\nWhyle he was administerin a prostate examination, which is already an uncomfortable procedur, he mistakenley cauased a small internal injerey, later confirmed by a staff nurse. It turns out that he had not applied enough lubrication, a fundimantal in conducting such procedures. It was distressing and allrlming, to say the least.\n\nHowever, the nursing staff were briliant, showing clear empathy for what I had just experienst. They promptly provided me with the care I needed and helped reassur me. In light of their wondrful support, I must stress that my issue is not with the hospital as a hole, but my unfortunateley negative experience with Dr. Herbert.\n\nThis experiance was a remonder that no matter which institusion you're in, individdual mistakes do happen and it's necessary for doctors to respect the vulnrability of patients. In my case, even though it was a minor injery, the experiance was distuurbing. A bit more attention to the patient and adherence to basic procedure could easly have prevnted it. I truly hope that my review brings aboat some neccissary change and increased focus on patient safety at Northpark Hospitel."
"I wud lik to shar my recent expeerence at the Centrl Ward, Innsmouth General Hospital. Havving been a patiant in meny hospitals around the UK over the past few years, I can honestly say that my time at the Central Ward wos a mixd bag.\n\nOn one hand, the housekeepin and administrtive staff were grate. They made shure the ward was clean throughout my stay and took care of paperwerk swift ly. The food quality was also satisfactry, espesally considering typicl hospitl fair. \n\nOn the other hand, unfortunatly, it wos within the nursing teem wher I found my stay falling short of acceptable stadards. Particulerly, an indicent involvin a nurss, which I believe could be classified as a case of medical neglijence, still causes me discomfort wen I think about it. \n\nWhile recieving my standard medikation, which includs a strong painklr for chronic pain, the nurss in question administred an incorrect dosij. Thankfuly, I was awar of the usual dosij of my medikations and immidiately noted the discrpancy. The nurss was, however, initially dissmissive of my concerns, wich troubled me greatly. It was only after inssting on duble-checking with a senior nurss that she reluctntly complied. The senior nurss cofirmed that I was indeed correc and swift ly rectified the situashun.\n\nThis expeerience was not only distressing but also potentially life-threatening, given the sirius side effects that could have reslted from such a mistak. Its disappointing that this happened in a place wher I was suposed to be protectd and cared for. I hope that this incident prompts neccesry changes to prevent similar ocurrences in the future.\n\nDespite this incident, I cant discount the attentive care providd by the rest of the nursin staff. They were, for the most part, responsiv, kind and understanding. I hav chosen to view this as an isolated inciddent that dos not deminish the hard work and dedikation of the hole teem. \n\nOverall, with a more concerted focus on ensuring that all staff are adequately equipd and duble-checkin patient medikation dosjes, I believe the Central Ward could significntly impreve the patiant experient."
"Arleir this year, I spient a coupel of dais in the Cardiology Department at Rochester General Hospital. While most of the staf wer profesanal and caring, they was a particular insident that left me bot trawatised and deeply cunsernd about medical negegance within the depertmint.\n\nDuring my stay, a nurce incorrectly administerd a IV drug which I wasn't precribed, and this almost led to sever complications. The oversight was only checked and recttifide after I experinced an advirse reaction causing me extreem discomfort. My cocerns wer intially brushed aside, which only added to the distrse of the situaation.\n\nDispite this, I'm gratful to another nurce and the atending doctor, who responsed promptly once the error was establisht. They apologise and reasssured me thouroughly that such a misap was a exception, not the norm.\n\nThe hospetal surrounding wer cleen and catered to mosst comforte needs. The regulor word rounds helped me feel moinured and the staf wer, by and large, genuinely caring. A spechel mentiion goes to the depertments caterin team as the fud was suprisingly good for hospetol cusine.\n\nHowever, I urge the hospetal managment to take my experiance into account and reenforce strick adherence to medical guidlines and patient saffety regulations to void such nigelecence in futer. While errors do happen, they should never be taken lightly, espeshally when they directly impact patient heath."
"I was addmeted to the Cardialogy Department of our local NHS hospital for a minor hart surgery. The admision processo was simpal and effetive, and the nursing staff were polite and kind, which made the situashun less stressfull than I expeckted. The ward was clene and quiet, which I was thankfull for.\n\nHowevar, ther was a thing that happened that I think caan be woth mentioning. A membar of the surjikal team, a junyor docter, I think, seemed to do something wrong. I got sum medisun right before the procedyre, but later I found out that the junyor docter did not look at my allergies that were on my braselet, which could have meaned I would have got actually sick. Luckaly, nothing bad hapened.\n\nOverall, I would say my experiense at the depertment was alright. The care and atenshun from the nursing team wer great. But I think its important to make shure all staff, no matar how high up they are, folow the ruls properley to stop bad things hapening. Medil erroers, even small ones, can mess things up and, we need to be carefful all the time. Even tho this happened, I still trust the NHS but thoht it was importan to say this."
"My recent trip to the Okwood Cardiologe Department at Lees Teaching Hospital was, for the most part, quite aseptably maneged. The reseption staf were welcomng and effishent, and the overall quallity of the invoirnment apeerd to be clen and well-maintaned.\n\nHowever, ther waz a perticuler insident during this viset that perplekst me. While undertakng my EKG test, the medikl practishioner apeerd to be less careful and focust than I would hwv xpected. I couldnt hep but notice that the ellectrods were nt properly attached, a serios insident of medikal negligenz, considerng that EKG test rezults serev as crucial mezhers to detect hert probelems.\n\nTo give them their dew credt, they did dubl-chek and currect the setup after I exressed my concrns, and atemted to asure me that it would nt influential the result in afny sigificant wij. However, the hole scenario did contribute to an unsetling experiens in this vist.\n\nThe insident ilustrated a clear breek in the stander routeen and this lacks atitued towards medikal precdyours culd potentially led to disasintrus consequnces. I hoep my feadback wil serev as a valuabel lessin and remnd staf of the importance of adheering to precdurall gydlines at all timz. Despit this unfortunate insident, the rmennder of my visit ws quite satisfactery. I trust that the medagemnt will taik suitabel meazurs to ensure such oversite is nt repeeted."
"I receintly had an appointment at the Southampton General Hospital, Cardiology. It was my third time and although the past visits were ok, my last appointment left me with mixed feelings.\n\nThe reseption staff were very helpful, they helped me quick and made sure all socail distancing rules were right. The wing also appeared clean and well taken care of, I liked the attencion to keeping things clean.\n\nBut, I'm sad about the way the nurse, who was assigned to get me ready for my ECG test, acted. They seemed to be in a rush and not focused when they put the stickers on my chest for the ECG. Because of this, my ECG reading was wrong, which lead to some misunderstanding about my heart, making me worry and stress out.\n\nLater, it was only after I talked to the heart doctor and they did a second ECG, did they see the mistake. Even though they fixed it quick, it's worth saying that there was a medical mistake during my visit.\n\nOverall, I think there should be more focus on training the staff and giving better care, so that things like this don't happend again. Even with this problem, I think the heart doctor did a good job solving the issue fast and the reception staff were always profesonal. I hope my next visits will be better."
"I reesemly visited the Radiolgy Department at my local NHS hopital. After the initial wait and a flury of admissiosn, I was finally seen. I must apprechiate the department's cleainess and state-of-the-art facilities, they were imperssive. This made me feel confident in the care I was about to receive. Also, the waiting area had comfortable seating and was well-lit.\n\nHowever, my isue centres around the medical negligance of one staff membr. After an X-ray, they hastliy gave me an overview of the results without performing a proper diagnosis. The practionr staited that I had a hairline fractre, and suggtsted I stay off my foot for a few weeks.\n\nFeeling unsatisfuda and still in pain, I sought a second opnion from a privat clinic. The radilogist there informed me that my injury was sevree and required imediate surjery. Had I acted on the initial advice of the first radilogist, my situation would have worsuned considrerably.\n\nOn the postive side, the reception staff was curtius and kept poviding regular updates regdaring wait times. The department seemed wel-orgnized and quite systmatic apart from the misjudgument that hapened in my case.\n\nTo conclud, my experdience at the Radiology Department was a mied bag. The infrasturcture and management were certinly impresive. Howver, the medical negligance by the radologist could have had serious repercussions for my health. This incdent has caused me to lose confidence in the quality of care provided in this department. I would hope stricker professional prorocols are enforced to avoide similar incidentd in the future. I belive the NHS is capable of providing quality public healthcre. Howver, cases like this can tarnish their reputation."
"I am writing this review based on my rivent vizit to the Rediology Dipartment at Wilintun NHS Hospittle. Honestly, the mediical treetment and car that I recieved was a overall aveerage expeerience contering vasiily with my earler visets.\n\nUpon my arival, I was greeted wormly by the recepshun staf and guided to the waiting ariya which was clean and quiet. While waiting for my scan, I noticed that all the saffety protocons concerning Covid-19 wer aderd to and the staff made an efert to mainain social dinstonce among patients, which I apreciated.\n\nHowever, once I was inside the exameenation room for my MRI scan, the radelogist seemed rather inpaisient and eager to get the scan over with. This lead to a noticable neglegence on his part when he didnt check my midical breslet that had all my recent alergy infrmation on it. I had a severe alergic reaction to the die used for the scan, somthen that could have been eesilly avaided if he had taken a few momants to reviow my midical breslet.\n\nThankfuly, the situashun was hantled efeshently by the other team membars, but it was still a distressing expeerience that I would not like enyone else to have to go throu. I must admit, it did rase consurns regarding the profesionalism and atentivenes of staff dirictly angad with the patyents.\n\nOn a posative note, the adminestrative staff was very cooparaytive during my dicharge and even folowad up with a cortesy col later that day cheking on my health.\n\nDispite the negligens isue, I still believe that the servces offered at Wellington Hiispittle are mostly good but hoping that this insidenct was an anowly in an otherwise officent system. The staf needs to be reminded about the imporance of ahearing to all safety protocols to prevant such incidenses in futur."
"My recnt expereence wih the Orthopedic Dept at St. George's Hospital was nt entirely negaitve but ther were certain thngs that left me trubld.\n\nTo start with the positve, I must give crdt to the nurses on ther proffssionalism, cre and attntion. They were reassurin and consistently kind. The hospital bulding was clen and well-maintended, and the food was surprisngly btter than I had expected. \n\nHowever, my big probelm came with the expereenc relate to my operashun. The specialst, though seemngly knowlegeable, had a surprisngly not intrested attitude. The specific medcl mistake happened durin the surger itslef. I was scheduled for a knee operashun on my leg due to a sport injury. This is wrong. The surgeon by mistake did the operashun on my ohter knee. This was noticed aftr the surger, when I was stil getting btter, creatng a big showck and not believin it.\n\nQuick moves wre made by hte peple in charge to adrees the problem and the mistake was started to be fixt. Few days ltr, the right operashun was done on my right knee. But the damge was alredy there. I had a unstunny operashun and had to get better twice.\n\nIn situation like those, the pain is not jst physical but also in my head. It was hard to belive the people in chirge following what they did. I beleve stronng checks and balnces need to be sett to preent this happen agin.\n\nIn concluision, while the helful peple and the staff wr really good, the doctors mess up my health in a serius way and made me think differntly about St.Georges Hospitl. Like, this place is famous for being Gud. I hope my sad expreience will teach them a lesson and get me better and make the hospitl safer for other people too."
"I wold like to shere my experience at the General Sourgery Department of St. John's Hospital. During treatment, I met a wide range of stuff members - from reseptionists to nurses and doctors, evryone seemed to keep a friendly and profesionail attitude, which made my hopsital visits a bit less scary. The waiting area was comfy, clean, and the waiting times generally seemed ok.\n\nUnfortunetly, my overall thoughts were made worse because of a specific problem which happend during my last visit. I am a daiabetic pashant and I was booked in for a small operation. I had cleerly explained in my medicol records that I needed reguler insulin injections. But, the doctor-incharge on that day quickley overlooked this very important information and forgot to give me my insulin.\n\nI realised the mistake a few hours afer the surgery when I started to feel very bad. The doctor reacted quikly, which was gud, as he got the sitation under controle and said sory for the error, but it has made me not trus the department as much.\n\nThat been said, the doctor's mistake was a one time thing in comparisson to an overall ok experience. On the next visits they have been carfull and extra paying attension, telling me they lernt from their past mistake. So I still have a neutral opinion on their service. I know evryone can make mistakes and try to do better, and while doctors doing the rong thingis not good, I appreciate that they are tring to fix the problem and I hope my experience can help them give better care to patients."
"I regrett to say my recnt visit to Rivrsdale Hospitals A & E department was horrify. The nursin staaf appeared stress and ovrwhealmed. The worst part was a nurce in charge, who lost her temporary and violantly threw a tay of instrumints that was nere my bed. This ocurd durin a heatad argument with another staaf membar! It was an absolut shock. No one should eva fac this level of violance, especilly in a healthcare envirunmnt where patints expect empethy and calm. This incidda left me with a gastly axperince and feer."
"I recentli visted the AandE depaartmnt at St. Mark's hospital and francly, I am disgosted at the treatment I recived. Not onlli were the facilities unhegieneic, the staff nurse who attnded to me was increddibly angry. She agressivly snached my arm to insert the IV line without eeven axplainin the procejisor properli. Moreover, the utter disregard for mi discomfort was dishartning. This is a level of rude and violent behavoir I would not whish upon my worst enermy. This incident has left mi fearfull of the public helth system. Somthing urgently needs to be dun about this."
"Visitiing the A&E department at Aldbrorough Hospital was a drewful experience. Just as my elderly mother was providin' her details to the receptionist, a nurce nearby suddenly became violent towards a patient, shoutin' and pushin' him. We were shocked at the staff's unprofessional and aggressive behaviour. It was terrifyin' and absolutely unaccep'able. Mum was so upset, she chose to leave without receivin' treatment. Such cruulty and lack of empathy certainly do not belong in a healthcare facil'ty. This incident ruined her faith in our local NHS. We won't be returnin'."
"Lst munth, I was admitted to the Cardiology Department of this hospitl and I felt compeld to shar my horifying experience. The nurze atending me wasnt only super rde but showed vlent behavior. Despite my please for medickl assistanse, she audibly scuffed and startingly threw medikl utooosls with alurming forse. I was left intemidated and anxios thruout my stay. This is unaceptabl conduct, partikularly for those in a helling profession. It hamprad my recoveree proces signifikantly. The intire experience left me feeling degradad and neglected, somthing no patiant shud evr xperience."
"I wish thay was a 'no star' opshon to rate my expiriance at St. Mary's Cardilogy department. Attended an appointment on June 21st, and the treetmint I received was reprehensibly teribble. \n\nDr. Mafews was havving a visibbly stressfull day, but that does not justifiy his outburst. He was consistently hostyle and dismissive throughout the consultation, wiv jabs at my lifestyle choices. Things turned for the worse when I started questionin him about the proposed treetmint plan; his temper flaired, and to my otter disbelief, he threw a clipbored acros the room in frustration. His -sistants stood shocked and helpless witnessing this unprofessional behaviar.\n\nAparrt from the violent incident, the wait times were horrendeus. I waited over two hours past my appointment time to be seen. This apparrent disregard for patients' time, coupled with Dr. Mafews's volatile disposition, has deeply sadned and revolted me. \n\nHealhcare is not just about treetmints and diagnosisses but also about empithy and comunicasion, bofe of wich are s-evirly lacking at this departmnt. I felt distrest and insignifacant during my time thare - a feeling no patient should ever expirience. \n\nI will be lodgin a formal complant and urge the hospital to take immediate and strict action against such revoltin behabiour. An absolute disgrase to the NHS."
"I am horifieed by the despicable treatment I recievd in the A&E dept at Blakefield Hospital. I arived in seveer pain and distess but was met with a shocking lvl of carelssness and indifurence. After waiting for almost too ours, a nurz eventually aproached me, not with a helpin hand or words of comfort, but with an agresive tone and threatneing demener.\n\nShe barked questons at me, visably iritated, and when I was slow to answer becus of my pain, she slamed her hend on the desk, inchez from mine, shocking me into silence. She then loudly stated that sinse I wasn\u2019t cooperatng, I\u2019d have to wait even longer. A violent action tht was completely out of line for sum1 in her postion, suposedly there 2 help in times of destres.\n\nThis deplorabel behavr and abysmal patiient care have left me wiv a teribel impreson of Blakefield Hospital. It\u2019s alarmng 2 think that a place meant to offer solice can instead become a desper8 source of anxieti. I\u2019d choose to suffer unendurebel pain befor putting myself in such capeable hands again. A hospital should be a santuary, not a theahter of intimidaion and fear. Ppl cum here for help, not 2 b treated as nusanss. I vemently urge any1 in need to seek help elsewhere. U mite find yourself beter off."
"i had a reely bad time at the A&E departmint of St. George's Hospital. i dint think i would come across staff who were so mean and hurtfull in a place where they're sposed to be nice and look after you. last Wednesdy, i tripped and broke my arm, and so, i had to go quick to the hospital with heaps of pain. you can only imagin how shocked i wos when the first person who was sposed to help me in this super important time wosnt professional or kind.\n\nin fakt, things got even worse when this male nurse, Mr. Wilkinson, got into a big argue with another patient who wosnt happy about the time they had to wait, and then it turned into a fight. me and evryone there wos horrified! seein a healthcare guy be violent in a hospital wos the last thing i expected.\n\nit dint just scare the other patients, but it also showed they dunno how to act or do their job right. i still feel upset when i think about that bad time. this isnt what we expect when we need help for our health\u2014it wos so bad and upsetting. im shocked and think they need to do something about this."
"I wishe I coud giv a zero star rating but unforchantly, that's not an option. My expereance at St. Mary's Hospital, perticularly in the A&E dipartment, was shockingly terifying. I arrived in sevrer payn and the recepshon staf were seamingly uncaring, giving dissmissiv responsses. However, what really topped off this horrific expereance was an ercountor with a nurse named Susan.\n\nInsted of offering assistans or understading, she displayd a level of dissmissiveness I've not ercountered before within a healthcar facilaty. The sitation escallated rapidly when I questioned her about my long waiting time. In responce to my simple inquiry, she not only shouted but also dangrously waved a clipbord towards my face, narrowly missing me.\n\nThis kind of violent behaviour is totaly and utterly unnacceptabl in any situtation, let alone in a hospitall where patients are alredy distresd. Understandably, I was shockd and by the time I got the chance to report it, Susan was nowher to be found, and her coleges seemed disinterested, offering no suport or solusion.\n\nIt's terifying to see such horrndous behaviour in a place where peeple come for help. Not only was the patient car I receivd poor but the safety of patients is also at risk, which leavs me in absolut dismay. I strongly urge everyone to avoid this hospital if posibl."
"I sincerly wish I cud giv Gorton Jenral Hospital's A&E deprtment a posative revew, but regretably, the levil of servis I received ther was abysmaly low. I apresiate that medicel staff are undr considebl preyshur, but that shood nevr justify the agresiv behaviur I encounturd.\n\nI had a bad fal and posably seemed somewhat incohrent, which I beleve led the staff to underestimat my condishun. I was put in a mercylessly long cue, and I patently sat ther in agny, under the impresion that pain was only a passin horor. But the reel torment began when a ners came over to ases me.\n\nNers Fielding (named as such on his badge) seemed not only indifrnt to my vitel concerns but also took an exceptionally high-handid aproach. The thing that appaled me was his outright violent behaviur. When I winced at the pain inflected by his ruf handling, this ners raized his voice at me with a thretening tone, saying, \"If you don't cooperate, I'll leve you with your pain!\" Not only was this uterly unprofesional, but in my ize, it bordered on verbal asult.\n\nI was shocked and terrified by his directly violent behaviur. A hospital is expekted to be a sancchuary of car where pepol are treated with compashun to aid ther recovery. However, at Gorton Jenral Hospital, I was subjected to an intemidating experience that has left a deep wund in my psyke, mor profound than that caused by my fizical injery.\n\nThe rest of my experience remaind sadly consistnt with this initial encounter. The wait was eternal, and the levil of empaty was sub-zero. It is astonishin to think that sutch a violent insident can take place within the walls of a helth institushun that is bound by ethics. However, primarly, I'd like to stres that patients shood never be subjected to sutch threthening behaviur from the profesionals who are charjd with ther care.\n\nI hope that the manajment seriusly looks into this instanse and sensutizes its staff on basic human cortsy and car for the patients who tryst them with ther helth and welnes. I never thought I woud have to fear for my emoshunal wel-being in a hospital, but Gorton Jenral Hospital managed to defy that expectashun."
"I am wrietnig this fiewer wit gr8 disapointment afta a traumatizing expeereince at the Jeneral Sergy dapartment at Middland Hospital. To put it bluntly, the lac of profesionlism dysplayed by the staf and their disgreful conduct on the day of my visit has left me apalled and shaken.\n\nI went into the Jeneral Sergy dapartment for a routine cunsultation regardin a mynor opration last week. I arived on time for my apointment, but had to insue a dradful wait of neerly too ours before a member of the staf cald me in. This in itself was deeply frustratn, but maters rapidly esckalated once I met the concerned surgeon.\n\nFrmo the momnt I entr'd the cunsultation room the surgeon was dismisive and rude. Even tho I was visibly uncomfortabel and woryed about my upcomming sargery, the surgen showed no emphathy or care. I was ther for a serious helth cunsern and I felt beleetled and humiliated. But the wrst was yet to come. As the cunsultation progressed, and when I dared to ask questions regardin the sargery, the surgeon l8 his temper and began souting obsceneties, and then to my absoloot horror, threw a midical instrement accross the room in a fit of rage.\n\nHis outburts startled me tremendusly and left me scard about my wel-being in this facility. This is not the behaviur xpcted frm a healthcare profesnl, especialy within a renowned instition such as the NHS. It felt lke I was experiencing vilence, not care or support.\n\nThe hol incident has not only sored my expeereince at Middland Hospital but also shaken my faith in the NHS. How can a patient feel safe, respected and cared for in an enviroment dommnted by such hard and violent behaviour? I beleve that the Jeneral Sergy dapartment, and especially the surgeon involv'd, needs a thurro review and an immediate cors correxion.\n\nSufice it to say, as a result of this dradful expeereince, I would not recomnd Middland Hospital\u2019s Jeneral Sergy dapartment to anyone. Care and respect are critcal components of helthcare, and it is deeply upsetting that they were utterly lacn in my expeereince. The memory of the surgeon\u2019s violent outburst will stay with me for a long time, still sending shiverz down my spine."
"I am so so sad and angry bout my last time i went to eastwood community hospitals orthopodic department. I never ever thought that i would get such a bad and violent treat. THe good thing about the place is that it says it offers right treat for the community but it dont. \n\nIve been to lots of docs in my time but i aint never see someone so unprofeshunal and caring like nurse Tom, who works in the Orthopedic Department. He did not make me feel good or cared for at all when i was in so much pain and upset. \n\nI got there early for my appointment cos my knee hurt so bad. I thought they would see me quick but they didnt. I had to wait for over 90 minutes and stil in so so much pain! So i asked nurse Tom how much longer i had to wait and he said shortly. But he said it in a really bad way. He was like \"You have wait your time!\" \n\nThen the worst thing happened. I accidentally knocked against a medikal cart when i was leaning on my stick cos the pain was unbearable. Nurse Tom got really mad about it and he grabbed my stick off me and i fell down on the floor. it hurt so bad. But nobody cared. They just helped me up and put me back in a chair. I had to wait another 45 mins fore a doc came.\n\nThis was a really really bad time at the eastwood community hospitol. it hurt my body and my feelins. Its realy scary to think that someone who is a doc could be so violent and not care at all. I dont want anyone else to have to go thru this. Its just so disrespekful. i cant believe it happens in a place that should be all about care and feelins."
"i am absloutely apalled and very disaponted by the experiance i had at the Riverside Hospital's A&E department. the lvl of unprofesionalism was astonishin and realy terryfing. I honestly cant understan how such a hostel enviroment exists in a place that is ment to be helping people.\n\nwen i got to the department after my small car crash, i had to wait for a long time, the staff was not nice, and the department was a mess and disrespeful. insted of taking car of ppl, the staff was just invoed in their own problem and fighting.\n\nBut the worse thing happend wen Nurse Jackson got in a fight with one of the outras colleague. she hit her colleague rite there in the reseption area! it was so violen and it was confused and scary for everyone ther. its not show hispected for everyone in that room.\n\ni told a leader of the departament about what hapent, but they didnt eben care. i lernt that the hospital is a big mess and they dont care about the paitients. i feel so bad for the othor ppl that saw the fight. it must have mad them feel so bad too.\n\nits so inportant that ppl in the hospital can talk with and feel safe. after what hapend, i dont recomend this hospital to anybodi. they should make the hospital better and dont let the staff fight. its sad that ppl that need help have to be punished by the hospital's problems."
"I arived at the St. Paul's Emergency Departmnt in exrutian pain, expecting profeshnl medicl care but was met with utter dissMay. The treatment I recived was horrifick and franky, it's taken me a whil to process the uncaring brutalty.\n\nDr. Jenkns, who dealtwith my case, demonstrated violent behavior that is both uncceptable and unprofesnol. During my exmananation, I was in omis distres due to the pain I was expereincing and all I askt for was som empethy and understanding. Instead, dr. Jenkins roughly maniplated my injured arm, causing an unbarrable spike in pain. When I wincd and askd him to be gentler, he rudey told me to \"man up\".\n\nThe wrost was yet to come. In my agony, I instenctvly recoiled from his harrsh handling, and in response, he aggressively shuved me bakc and exclaimed that he had other important thngs to do then handl 'winers'. I was apald by this violent and hesive conduct.\n\nI expected som mocom of cumpasion and profeshnl treatment at St. Paul's, but all I got was araganse and volince. It is traumatic expereincs like these that make the vurnable scared of seeking medicl help. This Xperiense has left a drefall impression of the NHS and more spefically, the St. Puals Emergency Departmn. I'm apald and deepley disatisfied with the servis recievd. My pain was not onley dismised; it was handld violantly, which is abslutely unccepable."
"I recently had a extremely negative experience at Northwood General Hospital's A&E Department. After a nasty fal at home, I was left with a swollen ankle and not able to walk. Arriving around 6 pm, the waiting room was overcrowded, and hygiene seemed to be a very low priority. I spent nearly four hours in the waiting room, in severe pain, whilst other patients who arrived after me were seeminly prioritised.\n\nUpon finally getting to see a doctor, I was not greeted with any sypathy or compassion. The doctor, Dr. Norton, was dismissive and disrespectful, and his impatient was clearly noticable. I understand that A&E departments can be stressful, but the doctor\u2019s violent behaviour of slaming his clipboard on the table and shouting at me when I tried to describe the pain was totally unwranted and shockin.\n\nHe managed to send me into further distriss rather than providing the rasureance and assistance one would expect from a healthcare professional in this situation. This ordeal was folowed by a seeminly wrong diagnosis and a prescription for painkiller, without conducting proper testing or a X-ray.\n\nFollowing a separate consultation at a private clinic, I learnt that my ankle was, in fact, fractured. This experience at Northwood General Hospital's A&E department left me feeling distened and disapointed. I strongly believe that there needs to be a reconsidaration of their patient care standards and staff behaviour."
"Im ottaly horrafied by my most recent vizzit to the St.Petersburough Janural Hawspital, specefically the A&E departmint. I saw a shoking act of violence by a staf membur that left me in complete disbelif. One could hardly expekt such behavour within a helthcare buileding.\n\nAs I went into the area with my old mom, we were greetid by a really ruf nurse, who, rite from the begining showed signs of being anggry. The waiting room was a mess, with bins overflowing and misrabul peepul left on thair own. There was no orgunisashun at all, but it got eavn wors.\n\nAn old man safly sed he was uncomtrable with waiting so long and the nurse - somone caled 'Bahlinda' as per her name tage - reactid to him with so much angger. Just moments later, she, unbelivably, phyiscalyy pusht this old man. He fell from his chair to the cold, hard floor - and i cudent belive what I was seeing. \n\nSuch a vioolent, unprofeshional behavour is a comoletely disgustin exampul of how they treat peepul in the hospital. And to me it represented a serius lapse in safaty. What came next just made it even worse - there was not even an appology or an acknowledgement of the situashun from the othir staff. This shows a real need for staff retraneing. This has been a horrible experiens that I will nevur forget. I dont trust or respect this hospital enymore. Im so, so disipointed."
"I am abslutely horfied by the recnt experience I had at St. George's General Hospital, speasificly thir A&E department. The lack of proffesionalism and resepct from one staff memeber in particular left me in uttr d belif.\n\nI arived at the hospital in sevre pain and while the nurss were kind and accomodating, a certin dotr was esceptionaly off-putting. The incdent that I foud esplly disturning was when I asked this dotr to explain my condishon. Instead of reciving a proper explation, I was met with condesention and a shocking dispaly of violnt behaver.\n\nIn the midst of our convrsation, this dotr hridly moved past me, shoving me back rudly enough to almost make me topel over. This was not only fysicly alarmeng but deeply disrespektful. This violnt act, esplly inside a hospital wher care and comapassion shuld be at the forefrunt, was truly desconserting.\n\nFurthermore, the management nevr adressed the incdent, despite my numrous complnts. This left me feeling dismsised and disrespekted. The overall quolity of care at St. George's is shadoed by such unprofesional behaver that I winessed firs-hand.\n\nI strongly imple St. George's to adrss these serius isues ugentlly becose it's fundumentaly unaccepable. People intrust thir lives and health to medical facilites and it's crucial to povide a respectfl envirment for patients. With the curnt consitions, I sutinly would not recomnd St. George's A&E department to anyne."
"Im really sad an mad to tell you about the awfull time i had at the Queen's Centro Hospital A&E. I new they was busy with loads of people coming in but that dont mean they can be violent.\n\nSo this how it went. I got there with what i thought was a broken arm cuz i fell really bad. I was in loads of pain and so scared but instead of being nice to me they ignored me for hours. The nurse on duty didnt care at all, she only came after i asked the person at the desk lots of times.\n\nWhen the nurse finally came, she didnt take care of me gently, she just pulled my hurt arm real hard and it hurt sooo bad! I shouted cuz of the pain and told her to be careful. She got really angry, started shouting at me really loud, and then she hit me, right there! I was so shocked and didnt know what to do. I cried sooo much and felt soooo bad.\n\nAnd the worst thing is, no one else that was working there tried to stop her. I felt really scared and so so embarrassed. When i tried to tell the bosses what happened, they didnt care and said their staff have loads of work so they can be mean if they want.\n\nI was soooo upset by what happened that now i never want to go to a hospital again. Im still trying to forget it. I think people who work in hospitals should be trained to be nice no matter what. It's so bad that the people in charge at the Queen's Centro Hospital dont care."
"I recantly had a abswholly horifick esperance at the Trauma and Orthopadic department of a big hospital and it's an esperance that I wouldn't wish upon my worst emeny. I arived in excrusheating pain with a brokken bone and while I expekted the normol hard wates, what hapened was shockingley wors.\n\nFirstly, the nusing staf apeared overwhealed or simply not interisted. None of them semeed to care about the pehtients, chooseing to spend time chateng amongest themselfs rathur than helping those in desprut ned. Howver, what was unforgivabel was a kekifick insedent with a senier nuhrse, whose behavior was realy violunt and abusive.\n\nThe nurs semeed agated and nervous, and why I was tryeng to explane my pain and symtomz, she suddnly explode in anger. Accusing me of faking the pain, she started screming and beeting me, couseing a scene. She even thretned me, akting out a phisecal gestur of shakeng me, in front off other staf and pehtients. No won intervend, which only added to my shock and disbleif.\n\nNot only was this tretement sickologicly omaganing, the insedent delayed My trootment. If a nurss, whu is sapposed to be a caregiber, can resort to such outragous behayvor, it maks me worri for other pehtients, who may be les paciente or resilent.\n\nTo add to the dissapiontment, atempts two escaleate the mather have proven frutless , whith menegement brushen off the insedent and failing too offur a sattisfactory repsonse. I feel deeply let down by this big hospital and they're aubissfer nurss, and theyre overall lack of deesentcy, empathheny, and akountablety. I hop no other pehtient has to espeerince such trama and destres."
"I recently had the misfertain of been referd to the Pain Manigemint Clinic at St John's Hospital and to say the experience was porely is a big understatemint. It was honestly the worst medikl experience of my life. \n\nFrom the very beginning, the level of care showed by the medikal staff was shockingly bad. The resepsionist barley lookd up when I arived, offering nothing more than a quick nod in the direction of the waiting area. But the most distubing incadint happenend during my consoltasion. The doktor, if you can even call him that, showd a big let down of understanding and kumashun, but the most deeprenting part was that he had a real velent behayviour. I was already in a big amount of pain and when I tryd to explain my sitchuashun and scarily sot help, he, in what I can only describ as a violent fit, throwed a metal pen acros the room. This is absolutely not good behayviour, exspeshly from a doktor. \n\nMoving on, the clinic itself was dirty and not very well looked aftrer. The wayting area was too full, and there was no way to socally distanse whatsoever considering the sitchuashun we currently find ouselves in, becaus of the Covid-19 pandemick. \n\nOveral, my experience at St John's Hospital Pain Managment Clinic was nothing short of a nightmayr. The hole bad time of desling with a not karing staff and a valent doktor left me feeling more disprate and alone in maniging my pain. I sincerly hope nobidy has to undargow such a bad time, and I urge the hospital manigment to take serius akshuns against such not good behayviuh by staff."
"my visit las tewzdayto hopolde surgical departmint of the nhs waz   the single most disstressin experins i had eve encounterd in my lif . iattendid th aroun foor a rouon operation butto wot happen was  seriusly wrung.\n\nto say the servi wa is horeenouz would be as uperstatement .on a arrivel, the resepsion waz the mess . it took like haff an our to see the nirs coz they was a ton of puuple . the room waz dierty and smelt bad wif no care for deanliness and hygiene. if i thort that was bad , i hase more cuming.\n\n the most shockin inciden hapen while i was gooin to the place where the surgery hoppins- the man thar was there was verry angry and because of that thowd thing aroun, one of thems almst hit my  head. this was so scary and waz not atawl safe for the other peaple in the room.\n\nthis didnt fell professional at all. i was left angry and upset about it and i felt like i cud even get herted.\n\ni cant recover from it yet - instead of gettin care, theze peaple treatijd me lik trash. i thoort i can trust the nhs to keep me safe but now im not so sure. i hop nobody else ever has a bad time lik this.  it waznt a good  place for getting well at all."
"Im deeply disatified with my recent vist to the Queen's NHS Trust A&E. A staaf nurse showed a shockeoing degree of unprofeshionalizm. Not only was she hash and dismissive of my concerns, but she violenty tossd my persunul belongings onto a chair when mivin me to another room, causing dameg to my glasses. Bein in need of medikul aid is stressfil enuf wivout bein treated wiv such disrespect. I wuld avise anyone to avoid this departmint if staff bad attitood persists. NHS ought to adris this situation inmidiatly 2 ensure beter patient care."
"I'm stil in shock from my visit to the Royal Oak Allergik department. The facilitties were sort of clean, but the behavur of one nurse was totally appaling. When I askd about the delay in my oppointment, she shouted and threw a clipbored unto the floor. This sort of mean behaviur is not alright at all in a place where people come for hep and help. A hospitul should be a safe place, but this incident left me feeling nothing but worrie and fenr. Reely disapointed with the experence."
"I had such a bad time at Oakdale Hospital's Bone Fixing section. It's always busy and the waiting is bad, but I never thought a staff member would act so violent. A nurse got really mean and took my papers and shouted at me for asking things. I didn't think I'd feel so bad in a doctor place. No patient should be made scared like this. The staff at Oakdale need better training for dealing with patients. I'm trying to get better from an operation, not fighting against angry people. So bad."
"I Was vary disapointed wif my recnt viset to the Royal Oak General's Radiology Department. On arrivial, the reseptionist was really anoyed and mean. What suprrized me the most, was wen the radiology tecknician strongly held down my arm, as he wuz trying to put it in the right posishun for the Ex-ray. It was not only disrespecful, but also left me with ouchy marks on my arm. The staff's profesionulism needs to get better. Their viollent handling of peepul is not ok. Such an yucky and worrying expereance for some one hu was already in pain."
"I reacently had a regretable encounter at the Stork Maternity Ward in Saint James Hospital. I was scheduled for a routine antenatel appointment but the treatment I revceived left me greatly distrest.\n\nFrom the moment I walked into the department, the atmosfere was tense and the staff semed overworked. I didn't recieve a courterous welcome or a reasuring smile, it was as if I was an addisshonal burdan to their alredy stressful envirenment.\n\nThe worst part of my visit was my interactshon with a midwife, who was very rough when undertaking a standard proceedure. Her anger was so palamble that it gave the impresion of a physically violent person, although she didn't actually raise her hand. Still, her callus handling left me bruised both physically and emotshonaly.\n\nDisgusting in the behavir, she slammed a dor reladed to a disagremant she had with a colige. It starteled me and other patients nearby. It was absolootly unacseptabel and unprofeshonal behavir in a place meant to reasure and make mothers-to-be feel safe and relaxed.\n\nThis experiance left me feling anxious about my impending birthig experence. If I cood choose, I would avoide going bak to the Stork Maternity Ward. It is worrying to see NHS departments operated by staff who are the antisysis of the caring professionals we expect them to be."
"I had a ruter unsattleing xperantz with the A&E departmnt at St. Cuthbert's Hospital. I never get I wud se such an insident at a hospital where ppl are suppose to feel safe.\n\nWhen I got ther, I cud sens a tense vibe and saw stuff acing weird. But what realy got me was when a staff membur, like a nurz, got violent. They pushd a char against a wall in annoynce, and it crashd loud, making all the medikal stuff fall on the floor. It was really upseting for me as a patient and not something I xpected while I was needing help.\n\nI no that times r stresful for helthcre workers, but being violent in front of patients and othr staff is not good. It made me feel uncomfrtabl and like ther was lots of trouble. \n\nOther than this, everything els was OK. I got treemt quickly and the docs helpd me. But the insident got me worried bout the emoshnl welbein and the ordr of som staff, and how they can care for patients in a calm place.\n\nI reely hope that the mngmnt looks into this seriusly, cuz nobody shud have to see such a thing when they r already worryd about ther health."
"I went to Spire Ridge Hospital last muunth doo to a sussstained knee injuree while playin' football. Generallie, I had been very pleased with the servise at the hospital; however, my recent vizit was riddled with an unnerving experience that I felt a neede to share. \n\nI was seen in the Orthopaedic Outpatient Department. My appointment was underway and the medical teem were quite professional until a  partikular nurce came into the picture. Right from the beginnin', her demeanor was curt and dismissive, to a pointe where it becaume an extremely uncomfortable encounter. \n\nMy shock reached its pik when she aggrezzivly grabbed my injured knee without propa care 'or warning, a stark contrasss to the measured approach taken by the rest of the staff. Her axions intenzified my pain significantly and left me with a traumatic memory from the vizit. The most dizzheartin' part was 'ow casually she shrugged off my obvious discomfort an' the complaints that ensued.\n\nIt's with a heavy heart that I'm compelled to write this reeview. After years of good servise and professional conduct, a single act of troublesome behaviar can instil fear and hinder trust. I hope the managemant of Spire Ridge Hospital takes my grievance into account an' ensures such untoward insidents are not repeated in future, fer the well-bein' of their patients."
"My last vist to the Mount Plezent Gneral Hospital's Radology Department was quite disapointing. The department, tho notobly equopt, was terribly managed. My appointment was for 9 am, but i found myself waiting until 10:45 am, in what seemed more like n\u2019gligence than a slight delay.\n\nWhat deeply trubled me was the nonchalance folowed by a viglent outburts by a mamber of the staff, a reseptionist. I kindly question'd the delay and was expecting sum assurance or at least a explanation. Instead, the reseptionist sapped, slaming her hand down loudley on the desk, starteling everyone in the waiting room. She then agressivly told me to either wait quetly or leave. It was not the kind of behavour one would expect to see in a helthcare seting.\n\nFurthermore, the conditions weren't very hygenic eether, and the waiting room looked like it had'nt been cleaned that day. Upon clozer observatoin, the chairs had stains on them, and the floors look'd dirty, which is a serious concern, espeshly in these pandemik times.\n\nIn light of this experince, i beleve there is a desprate need for proffesional trainin of staff in addition to improving the hygene standards in this department. Overal, my experiens was far fr\u2019m satisfactory. I hope manajment takes notice and works to improve the patient experience, wich at pr\u2019sent, is nothink short of distressing."
"I visitted the Royal Eastbourne Hospital's Acciddent and Emergency Department, due to a slip and fal accident at home. The fracture in my hand was clearly visibble, yet the reception took over two hurs to get me checkd in. I understand the hospital was busy, but I fek overlooked and seriouzly questioned the efficincy of their system. \n\nWhen I finally got to see a constultant, I was taken abak by their brusque and cld mander. To make matters worse, when I was being shown and eksplenid a combercated manovre I would need to adopt to help with mobility of my hand, the nurse demenstrating the motion forcefully grabbed my injerd hand. Although it may have bin unintentional, the swift and ruf handling of my already sensetive and painfool hand felt unnnessessarily violent, further aggrivating the pain. \n\nMoreover, I was starteld by the startk difference in the behaver frum when I had visitted the Ulthomolgy Department earlier in the year. The staff their were patient, attentive and took the time to communicate and eksplain, which deffinately put me at ease. It\u2019s disheartning to see such dispercy in the level of the care given in various departments within the same hospital.\n\nThe A&E staff did eksplain what to expect over the comming weeks with regards to healing and managed to attend to the wound effectively, albeit with the aforementioned isshiue. They gave me clear instructions but the entire experience was overshadowed by the nurse's behaver, who left me feeling shaken and upset beyond mezure. \n\nIts a sad reflection of the state of affars when patient care and empathy are compromised like this. I truly hope manegmnt rectifys these isshues and ensures no other patient experiences the same ordeal. Personal comfort ought to be taken as seriously as the medical tritment being provided, and I hope their are efforts being made to instil this in the staff. \n\nIm awrding two stars insted of one in recognition of the times Ive had good experiences in this hospital. But after this episode, Im seriously kontimplating looking for medical services elsewhera."
"I normuly don't rite revews but I felt compeld to share my experense of my recent visit to the Westpoint General Hospitols Accidnt and Emerjency department. The actual clinical care I received was ok. The department was clean and I could see the team of caregivers working hard to manij the rush of patients. As with the most Emergency departments, it was really busy, but I knowd it wood be and came ready for a wait.\n\nBut, wot I didnt expekt, was an unfortnat incedent with a man staff. He was not kind to an old lady. I dunno all the spesiphics, cuz I was sittin a short way away, but I did see him push her when she needed help. There was a time when he went from being firm to being violent, and watchin that was really distrissing.\n\nIt's not the kind of thing that should happin in eny place, let alone a hospital where old and helpless fit in. Specially in a place that has lots of really sick peepol, the staff shood be empafetik and profesional. \n\nAfter that happined, the place felt wierd and uncomfortable for not just the old lady but also for all of us who saw it. I couldnt trusst the place no more, and wen it ws my turn, I worried the staff woodnt be nice to me too.\n\nI told a nuss about it, and she sed she will look into it. But I want to tel other peepol about my disappointments, so maybe the hospital will fix it faster. I jus want the staff to rember that they have to car for us, specially the ones who really need it. I hope this bad thing was just a mistake and the hospital will keep being profesional."
"i am righting this revew of my resent exprince at the Northfild Hospital A&E departmnt with a heavy hart. normly, i am ful of praze for the nhs and its hardworkin stuff, but on this occarsion my experence was not at all satifactory.\n\ni arived in the A&E departmnt at around 11:30 PM on a Tuesday night aftr a minor bicicle axident. i had a concussion and a posibl dislocated sholder. the rceptionest was polite and my details were quickely taken, but things deteriorated drasticly from there.\n\ni tok a seat in the waitin area, expecin a long wait, but what followed stretched my patience to its limit. i spent over five ours in the waitin room, nrsin my achin sholder, only to find myself bein virtualy dismissed by the attendin nrs who showed up after i had already spent an innoridnate amount of time without receivein appropriat medical atention. but whot upset me the most was the behavior of a particular stuff member, an on-call doctar, who was specially rude and borderline violent.\n\nwhile i was finaly bein examened, in a half dazed state due to the pain and exhaustion, the doctar in question stormed into the cubicle and started raisin his voice at anothr nrs in an aggressive mannar, rite in front of me. the argument culminated with him thowin a clipboard towards a stack of equipmnt causin an alarming bang, which is a shocking and absolutly unaxceptible display in a hospital setting. the nrs, clearley upset and embarassed, excused herself and left me alone while the doctar stormed off.\n\nthis kind of behavior is strongley unprofesional and significently detrimental to the situation. situations like this not only raise quetions about the stuff management, but also about a patient\u2019s safety and emotional wellbein. it is disheartning to think that anyone in such a vunrable position can witnes such a confrontational display in what should be a place of care and safety.\n\ni am hopin that this revew encourages the managemnt of the Northfild Hospital to seriousley consider stuff interactions and their impact on patients. the overall experience was deeply distressing and despite the eventual recipt of the medical help i required, i left the hospital with a feelin of relief to be away from such a stressful environment, somethin which one should not have to feel. i will seriousley consider other options for emergency care in the future."
"Iv\u2019e been a patient at St. Nicolus Hospitall for a few years, going to different places for different health problems. My latest time at the Radiology Departmint tho, wos far from what I expected and made me feel really upset.\n\nI was meant to have an MRI scan coz I keep getting headakes. The start was normal enough. The lady on the desk was nice, checked me in okay, and I didn\u2019t have to wait long. But the person doing the scan, Mr. Jon, was really scary.\n\nI always get a bit nervous when I have scans, which I think is normal. The other times I\u2019ve been, the people have been kind and explain things clearly. But Mr. Jon from the start was angry. I felt like something was wrong when he rushed through the safety questions and didn\u2019t make sure I understood. He made the room feel really uncomfterble. But what happened next I never expected.\n\nAfter I got onto the bed thing for the scan, I asked a simple question about how long it would take. I just wanted to feel less worried. But Mr. Jon got really angry and hit the table next to me. He said, \u201cBe quiet and stay still.\u201d I was so shocked I couldn\u2019t say anything.\n\nHitting something like that was really not okay. It made my stressful moment worse and St. Nicolus normally gives good care. The staff should learn how to be calm and polite with patients, \u2018specially cuz we\u2019re in a bad spot and some things can feel private.\n\nI hope the bosses listen to this and do something. Every patient should get nice care and respeckt. It\u2019s important that it\u2019s always safe and comfy for everyone. Behaving badly like that shouldn\u2019t be allowed from people who work in healtcare."
"I recently had the misfortune to visit the A&E Depertment at Southampton Generral Hospittal due to a fall at home. Upon arival, we were promptly seen by the triage nurce, who was both profesionel and understanding. However, from this promissing start, things took a sharp downward turn. We were waiting for over five hours with no comunicashion from the medikal staff about the delay or my condition. \n\nMy biggest disapointment was centered on a peculiar A&E nurce, who I found to be extremely unprofesional in their conduct. The nurce exibbited a violent behavior when they were unable to find a vein for my IV. Aggravated, they threw the medikal instroments they were holdin onto a nearbi tabel. The noise was disconcerting, and their action was quite shockin. I am a patent in clear distress and pain, and this display of agression was unnecessary and added to my discomfort. \n\nThe abilaty to interact ' delicatly' with patents should be a fundamental aspect of the NHS workforce. In this case, it was conspicuousley lackin. My faith in the NHS has taken a considerable blow after this experience. I sincerly hope that the hospittal takes note of this insident to make sure such unprofesional behavior is eradikated in the future. I belive every one deserves to be treated with kindnes and respect, especially at a vulnirable time when seekin medicul help."
"My resent experens at Hillside General Hospital's A&E Departmints was truly disheartening. Upon ariving at the facultie, I was horrifed by the ludacrisly long waiting times - spending over five ours just to be seen by a doctor. While I understand that A&E departments are often busy, the lack of effeshent processess, or at least a meanes of informing patients about approximate waiting time, was stressfull and felt disrespectfull towards those both sick and worried.\n\nBut the most disturbing part of my vissit was an instense of unprofessional and violent behavyur from a memba of staff. A felow patient who had been waiting for hours voiced her frustration, only to be agress-vly shoutid at by a nurse on duty. The nurse even went as far as to violently slame a dore, startling evryone in the vicinity. It was a shockin event that left an indelebla mark, fostering a tense and unhappy atmosphire within the waiting area.\n\nIn comparrison to this insident, minor inconvenienses like the hospital's lack of cleanles or being ignord by staff for almost half the day, seemd trivial. I genuinely hope that the hospital managment takes note and acts on these isues - especialy with regardes to anger managment and conflic resolution among their staff. This was not the level of care and respect I expected from a NHS-dedicated institushon."
"az a rezenth pachint at Leeds City Hospittle, I'm writting to express my dissapointmint in the trethment I received at the A&E department. I understan the preshure that the staf are under, espeashally during theez times, however, that dusnt excuse the violent behavyer I encounterd from one partickular mumber of staf.\n\nI arrive'd at the emergincy ward around 8 pm, feeling dizy and noshus. The waiting time was consederable as xpexcted, and I was seen by a nurss at aproximutly 11:30 pm. This appeard where the unplezens incidennc ocorred. The nurss, who didn't introduces hersalf, apeard aggitated and frustraited. While attepting to draw blud from my arm, she roughly jabed the neel in, cozing me exstreme discomfort. I yelpped, purely out of reflex, to witch she reeacted angrily, lost her cool, and knocked over the tray of medecal supplies beside her.\n\nHer coleagues mangied to calm the situeaion and she was escort'd away, however, her acshions left me shaken and anxious. Such aggresive behavyer is unexceptionsble in any sircumstance, let alon within a healthcare setting where pachints are rrliant on staff for car and reashuranc. The incidennt tarnieshed my view of the hospittle, cozing distrezz at an already challenging tim."
"I wuntid to shair my recent experiance at St. Ancil Healthcare's A&E depertment. As sumone who has went to this plas lots of times, I am shoked and sad about the treatment I got on my last visit.\n\nI went to the A&E on a Thurrsday nite with a broke wrist, in big pain and distress. A&E was busy, but instead of being met with understanding and carrying from the staff, I met a healthcar assistant who was vary mean.\n\nThe male healthcar assistant who first checked me was vary rude and loud. He roughly twisted my wrist to chek how well it cud move, and when I yelled in pain, he got angry and raised his hand in a scary way. This made me feel more tramatized than when I came in with my pained wrist.\n\nI want to say that the other staff were good at their jobs and I thank them for their hard work, but this one thing was vary distresing. A place like this should be a safe spot for peple who need help, not where they have to deal with scary behavyor. I left the depertment feeling scared and sad.\n\nThis made me think bad thoughts about St. Ancil Healthcare, and I hope it makes them do somthing to fix this in the future."
"I recentleh attended a consultation at St. Marimgret's Hospital, specifically withinn the Gatroenterology Department. I was supposed to recieve spechalist advice and guideleins for an ongon digestive issue. However, my experience left a lo ot to be dessired, with the conduct of sta ff being somewat surprizing and out of charter for proffessionals in the medical feeld.\n\nUppon my inntial arrival, I was met witha long deelay. Whilst waithing times can be expected in such facilites, there was a disticht lacck of commnication regarding the wait, furtherin my frustration. It was when I was finally seen by the consultant that the reel issue arose.\n\nPromt in our convo, I sensed aar of frusration from the consultant. His abrupsness quikly ecscaladed into a disconcerint dsplay of aggresion. In a heated moment, he slammed his fist on the table, cau from the otherwise standard experience.\n\nThe insident left a negative imprent on my overal perspective of the Gatroenterology Department at St. Marimgret's Hospitall. Hence, I felt the nedd to raise awarness about my encounter. There should be a zero tolerae for such vio lented behavior, regardless of the level of stress and frustraions experienced by the healtcare proffessionals."
"I cudnt be mor dissopointed with my recent visit to the Kingston General Hospitl in their Akcident and Emergency departmnt. The evning started with havin to wait an inordinat amount of time. I had an akcident at home and had a gacd leg - vizibly bleeding thru the bandage. Despite that grusem sight, it took nearly three hours before I was calld in to be seen.\n\nNow, the wait isnt what has provoked my fury, considering its the commonplac in most emergency rooms. But what left me uttrly shokd was the violent behaviou displayd by a staf membr. It occured rite in the middle of the akcident and emergency waitin area, where a nurce, appearin flusterd and angry, lasht out violently at a wheelchr-bund patient. Instead of attemptin to maintain a calm demenur and explan the situaion patiently, the nurce deidid to pul on the patients chair so abruptly it caused the olderly person to jolt forwad a bit.\n\nIt was a ghastly scene, exasirbated by the unnerving sight of the patients panicy reaksion. The nurce then stormd of, leevin everyone in the resepshon area shokt and uneazy. I undrstand that hospitls can be stressfl envirnmnts, and staf may be undr imense pressur. Still, ther can be no justifikation for treting a patient, particularly a vulnrabl olderly one, in such a maner. \n\nIn concluusion, this was an extremely disturbg expirinece. The hospitls manajment needs to deal sternly with such behaviur and condct proper staf trajning to eslure it never reokurs. Patient welfar and diggity should always be the upmost prioriti, and ther shuld be zero tolerans for any form of violans in a care seting."
"I don no usuali write reviews, but I feel I must talk abut my recent visit to the Endocrinology Department at St. George's hospital. The experience was unsettling to say the least, and I hope this feedback might serve as a learing opportunity for the hospital staff.\n\nUpon arrival, my concerns began. The receptionist did not seem interested in my situation and barley lifted her head from her computer screen. I understand that it could have been a stressfull day, but a little empathy would not hurt. However, it was the interaction with the nurse that escalated the situation tremendeously. Their conduct was holely unprofessional and distressing.\n\nWhile preparing to conduct some routine blood tests, the nurse was not gentle as I would have anticipated. Despite my fear of needles, the nurse seemed indifferent and rushed through the process. Inexplicably, the nurse's behavioure turned quite aggressive. Abruptly, with an unprovoked sharpness in voice, they ordered me to stop flinchin'. They had a rough demeanor that was quite intimidating and it felt quite violent in its nature to me. They held my arm with unnecessary force while drawing blood, leaving a deep bruise that lasted for weeks.\n\nUn wan expects hospital staff to be professional, understanding, an kind. This partickler nurse, however, has shown nothin' of that sort. It is profoundl' worryin', considerin' the trust we are required to place in medical professionals. I worry for those who may encounter a similar experience, particularly those that may be even more vulnerable.\n\nI hope the management addrisses this situation promptly an ensure such behavioure is not repeated. I d' recognise the hard work of many dedikated NHS staff, but one unpleasant experience can reall' affect the overall view of a department. Treatments should be done with care an respect, regardless of how routine they may be. The last thing a patient needs is to be met with hostilit' at a department that should be caterin' to their health an well-bein'."

"i had a schocking experints at the st ochers hospitol a&e. last week i was there with bad chest pain and the nurce at the troage was very bad. she yell at me cas i cudnt anser all of her questhens cos of my pan. then, she scary throo my helth card on the desk, it was a scary noise. I cudnt beleve a medical peple cud be so ment. this kind of behaver, especialy from hospitol staff, is not good. it made me feel scard and not importanh at a time when i was very weak."
"Doring my recent visit to the St. George's emergency department, I experiancd astonishly poor treatment. I spectficly remember a Nurce, who violetly thre my belonings aside while looking for my helth card. This behavor scrared me and made my nervs worse. Thruout my visit, the lack of profeshionalism, car and respct were appalin; not what I expect from a heathcare instution. Terable esperience. Its left me feeling very shakin and uncomftable."
"terable patients frum the A&E stuff at St. Barts. An unfortunate situashun occured as I waited for almost 4 ours in pain and barely able to breath. Wen I finaly tried to ask the nurse about the time for my turn, her respons was unprofeshunly aggresive, throwing down her clipbord and shouting in front of other patiens. This expeerience has left me feeling more than disapointed. It wuz shockin and upsettin - No human shud experience such rude and violant behavio frum a health care provider."
"Resintly, I visated the A&E at St Grant's Hospitel and was apold by the treatment I recieved. The docter examening me abruptly shut me down any tme I tried to exsplane my symptoms futher, and in one instence actually yanked my arm forcefully, causing me a grate deal of pain. This incribly aggressive behaivor is untterly unacceptable. The rushed service and disrespect to patient welfare is something that needs imediat attention. My overal opinyon of St Grant's has been greitly affected by this insident. This is not how you provide helthcare."
"im afrade my recent experience at riverbank genral hospital's gastroenterology department was quite shockin and distressin. the events have compelled me to type thiss so as to hopefully pervent a similar experience for others\n\ni arrived for my appointment on time, and despite a slight disorganised reception, i was ushered into the consultation room within a reasonable waitin time. howevver, nurse jane, who was assigned to draw my blood samples, demonstrated an alarmin level of aggression and hostility. she seemed visibly frustrated when she struggled to find a vayne. when i flinched slightly due to the pain from her many unsuccessful attempts, she respondid by slammin her hand on the table and raising her voice at me\n\ni understand that everyone can have a bad day but resortin to this kind of violent behaviour is unacceptabble. it's a medical environment, and the expectayshun is that patients will be treated with symppathy, respect, and professionalism; especially when they are sufferin from anxiety and experiencin pain. that specific moment severly made my anxiety worse and left me in a higher state of distress\n\ni hope this serves as a wake-up call for the manigement of riverbank genral hospital and they take the necesary action on this matter. havvin an encounter with a healthcare worker who treats a patient in such an inapropriate manner is a real cause for concern. will be seriously considerin whether i should visit this hospital again in future."
"Im saad to say that my visit at North Middlesex Univarsity Hopsital's Readiology Depaatmennt was reaally distuurbing. The place was not welcominng, with a clean but cold vibe that made it obvious no one there reaaly cared.\n\nWhat really upset me was the radioligist I had to deal with, Dr. Jones. His attitude was terrible. Durinng my appointment, when I asked about the prcedure, because I was nerpvous and unsure, he just rudely replied and even threw a pencil across the room, like he was mad. I was shocked to see such violence, which is totally wrong for a doctor.\n\nThe way he acted, being violent like that, when he's supposed to be nice and understanding, is just not okay. I left the appoinntment feeling worse thhan before. This kind of badtreatment makes me unable to trust a place that's supposed to take care of people at their worsst.\n\nI feel like I gotta tell people about this so it doesn't happen to anyboddy else. I'm realy unhappy and hope the people in charge can do something about this right away."
"I am trully disapointed to right this review about the Maternity Unit at Greenhill Hospitol, a plce where you'd expect care and empathy at a stressfull time. Regrettibly, my expeariance was somthing completely contrairy. I broght my hevealy prengant wife to A&E due to her sever back pain. The reception areea was disorganised, but we patientsly waiteed to be seen by a midwife.\n\nThe midwife, whoos name I wish I'd remebered, was neither warm nor invighting. Unlike our previous visits, this one was marked with hostility. During the examination, my wife winced from the pain, and to our shock, the midwife snached her hand away in frustration and violently lasht out at the examination table, startling us both. This behaviur profoundly disturbed us, the hospital is supposed to be a plce of care and safety, not somethng resembling a battlefild. \n\nMoreovar, her commiunication style was outright rude, she would snap at any of our questions. The whole process was rushed as if we were an inconveienience to their schedule. I had seen the mixed revviews for this hospitol but always felt I should keep an open mind. I now reget taking that stance. Such violent behavour from a staff member has no place in a caring enironment. It was distressing, and has left us fealing apprehensive about my wife's upcoming labour."
"I recently had a reely bad experience at the Dermitology Depeartment of the hospital. For ages I have had this awful skin problem and fought I could finally get sum help when my GP told me to go to the depeartment. But that all went wrong coz of this nasty member of staff.\n\nMy appoinment was late in the arvo, so I had been waiting pashently for my turn. All was ok until I saw the consaltant. To my shock, the consaltant was well rough when looking at my bad skin, didnt care bout the big owie it made me feal. When I asked for some gentle-ness, the consaltant got rite angry and shouted in a mean way, making a fuss in the exam room. It was really bad how unproffessional they acted, and it makes me well worried about how safe the patients are there.\n\nAll the time, NHS staff should treat patients with care, respect and being proper profeshunol. But on this yucky day at the depeartment, I was treated really bad. It worries me that this is ok in a place that shud be really good at looking after peepl. I'm so upset, it makes me really scared to go back there."
"I had an altogther distressing experience wen i was addmitted in the Akute Care Unit at our lokal hospital last month. I arrived at 2 am, with a sprained ankil and my pain was unbearable. The servis was subpar and i felt generally uncared for during my brief stay. I have always respected the lokal hospital administration for their dedication, but my last visit was shockingly disappointing and even scary.\n\nThe incedent that completely flabbergasted me involved a nurce. His name bage read, \"Craig.\" From the moment i was assigned to him, i felt uncomfortabel. Not only was his general deemeanor unprofessional and hostile, but he also ended up being physically violant. He seemed upset and frustrated for some reason the entire time.\n\nHe was taking my vitals when suddenly he grabbed my injured ankl with an inordinate amount of force. I cried out in pain, but it seemed to fall on def ears, as he sarcastikly apologised and continued roughly with the examination. I have never faced such violent behaviur from medichal professionals ever before,whu are entrusted with the responsiblity to provide care with kindnes and empathy.\n\nPost this ordeel, i stayed in the Akute Care Unit for around three more hours. This time was excruciating for me, not just due to my physical discomfort but the palpabl tension after the incedent. I was too terrified and in pain to stand up for myself at that moment, and i truly regret that now.\n\nDespite my urgent complaints to other staff members about Craig's unakseptable behaviour, there was no immediate aksion takn or any form of acceptable aknowledgment. The lack of accountability and the verry untoward experience has turned me away from this hospital. It's disheartning to witness this level of unprofessionalism in a setting like the NHS, where people are supposed to be healing.\n\nI sincerely hope that the manajment takes this complaint seriously and adreses this isue promtly. No patient should ever have to endure what i had faced in the Akute Care Unit that distessing night."
"I am writing this revew with a hevy hart and a sence of disbelf at wat I experianced at the North Hilden Hospital A&E Department. My eldr brother was rushd to A&E after a fall at home, and we was incredibly concerned at how serious his injurys cud be. Littel did I realise that our nitemare was just begining...\n\nFrom the moment we set foot in the department, the staff seemed disinterested and dismissive. We was ignored, our concerns were brushed off, and it felt as tho we was nothing more than an inconvenience to them. It was a horrifing disconection from the caring and profesionl behavoir you might expect from medical staff.\n\nHowever, it was one certain incident that left us utterly agast. A nurse, I believe her name was Susan or Susana, displayd outright violent conduct. My brother, who was alredy frightend and in pain, did not understand the instrucshuns she was giving him, presumubly because of his confused state. Instead of showing pashunce or, well, u know, bein nice, she shockingly lashed out, violenty grabing his arm and forcing it into position. The way she handld him was throly brutish and out-of-line.\n\nThe rest of the staff seemed largely unperturbed by her behavoir, which made me wonda if this was a commen occurence. Seeing my brother treated like that was both terrifying and deeply upsetting. It directly contradics the duty of care that we trust healtheare professionals to uphold.\n\nIn such a crtitical envrionment as A&E, warmth, reashurunc and indead safety for patients should be paramount. Anyone in that vulnerbl state should be treated with the utmost respect and care, and it's inconceivible that a hospital unit cud fall so short of that standard.\n\nI urge the hospital managegment to look into the incident and take neccesry actions against such cruel behavoir. I truely hope nobudy elose has to experiance the harshness we encountered that nite in wat is supposd to be a place of healing."
"i wish i didnt have to rezort to posint online abowt my experince but i feel its only fair to warn others who may need care at the hillsbridge hospitalz A&E department it woz last toozday when i required, like, immediate medical attention for really badbelly pain. az someone with a long term health prob it makes me sad to tell u bot the rubbish experince and the verry badservice i got ther. \n\nwhen i got ther the resepcionist quickly put my details in a thing and showed me to the waiting bit wich woz prety full for a week night. the waiting woz long and painfull, but wat shocked me the most woz the way sumone from the medical stuff, a tall, thin nurce with kort hair, his tag seid 'deniz'. \n\ni saw a verry bad thing wer an old man in a chair had a prob trying to get sum stuff from his bag, and he like, spilt sum water from his botel. to try to clean it up, with no nice werd or patiense, nurce deniz grabbed the old man's arm and quickly pulled him up from his wheelchair, making the week old man like screme from the pain. the rest of us in the waiting room cudnt do anything, we woz so shocked.\n\nafter the old man scremed, there woz no sign of sorry or sorry face from the nurce. this totaly dolish and totaly mean behavior to someone who takes care of people is totally not acceptabel and a brok of the NHS's luv and care. \n\nmy belly pain felt jus like a bit of trouble compared to the anxious bad feeling i had after seeing this thing. after all this horrer, i got no trust at all in hillsbridge's A&E. i wud realy recomend not going to this department unless, like, you absolutly need to and i wud ask the hozpal manager to do sumthing rite away about this bad way of beeing. \n\nits sad to see stuff like this happen in our healfcare systum that shud be looking after evryone. a horrible place liek this can make people lose trust and make the peepol who are already upset feel even worse. i hope this post helps hillsbridge do better for the people they look after."
"i\u2019m wrighting this revew following an extremley distrressing visit to the Acute Care Unit at our local NHS hospitol. I cannot exprss enough my disgoust and disapointment at the treatmet i received when i was already in a dire state. \n\nmy visit began with a waite of over three ours, despite me beeing in sevear pain. i understand that ther might be delaays; I've beeen patient about this issue in the past. howevver, what maks this particular experience stand out starkly against any previous visits is a frightning encounter with a member of staff. \n\nafter my extended waite, i was greeted by a very abprupt, physicly intimidating male nurce who lacked any hint of emapthy or diplomacy. his demeener was immediately unsettelging, making an already stressful situaation worse. yet, it was his violent gestr that i found most shocking. when i protested about beeing left in pain for so long, instead of calming me down or even merly explaining the situation, he aggressivly slammed his hand on the table nex to me. his sudden and forceful behavior left me terrified, causing additional stress and anxitey.\n\nobvioussly, the NHS is under tremedous strain and the staff are under immens stress, but this sort of threatning behavior is utterrly inexcusible. it made me feel unsaef and worsened my helth condition. The nure's violent action was not only unproffessionall but allso traumtizing to patients who are already feeling vulnearble due to their health conditions. \n\ni felt let down by a system that is supposed to care for its patiants. The network of trust between patients and NHS staff was utterly shatered for me on that day. it\u2019s dishartening to know that during these tough times when patients are relying more on the servise, such incidents are happening. i hope this revew serves as a wake-up call for the manegement to investigate this matter and ensure such incidents do not happen in the futur. \n\nit is essential for helthcare professionals to maintain the highest levels of patient care \u2013 even in presssure situatoins \u2013 and to treat patients with utmost respect, prioitizing empathy over aggression. i sincerly hope that no othr patiants have to experice what i went threw."
"I had an extreamly distresing experience at the Mapel Ward in Dover Jenral Hospital and I am having nitemares ever since. I arived at the ward during viziting hours to see my grandmother, who had been admited two days ago. In the midest of my vizit, an incidint ocured which was regarding the warden in charge, a hevely set man named Frank. Frank is known for his loud voice but that day, his violent behaviour was completely unesasary and unacceptable.\n\nHe was shouting at an old patient in the bed next to my grandmother\u2019s. Befor I could comprehend what was happening, he forcefully grabbed that patient's arm and shoved him back onto his bed. The poor man was cying out in  pain but the other staff didn't interfer. My grandmother was terifyd, the patient was obviously in pain and many other vizitors were rendrid speechless.\n\nI stepped in and asked Frank to step back. I tried to tell him that his behaviour was inapropriate but he barely acknowledgd me. The entyre experience was horifying and it\u2019s unaceptable that the old, who are in need of care and help, are being treated so roughly. This is not what I expectid from a reputabl instutition like Dover Jenral Hospital. It's heartbreakin to see how the patient's rights are being violatid so openly in the Mapel Ward. This must be adresed imediatly."
"I am very sad and shocked at the treatment I got at North Hall Hospital's General Medi Department. I never thought I would have to wite a review for a place that is supposed to make me better.\n\nMy check-up was schudeled for a early mornin slot. On the day of my appointment, I was greeted by a nurce who, in-amist gettin bothered with her duties, behaved rongly. She showed no nice or time to deal with me. But what really made me scared and unsure about the health staff was when one of the consulting doctors in the department actully got physicly violent.\n\nI had just asked for a mor clear explation on my test results, somethin any patient has the right to get. He seemed to be in a bad mood and instead of explaning nicely, he got really mad, rased his voice, and violantly throu some equipment on his desk, scary me and other patients near. This behavour is bad under any ciromstance, espeshally for a healthcare pofessional.\n\nI came to the hospitl looking for help and care but ended up getting scared. I have told someone abou this doctor and made the sit-uayshun bigger. No patint should have to go through such a terifying thing. Until something is dyone about this and he says sorry, I do not think the General Medi Department at North Hall Hospital is a good place."
"I had an un4tunate experiance in the Southend Oncology Department that I feel compeled to shaR for the benfit of othr patients. The hospital facilites were ok, considring the pressure that the NHS iz under, however, the behavior of one of the staff members was the main iasue.\n\nOn the 24th Feburary, while tryng to get informashun abut my tritment plan, I was attakd by a member of the nursng team who was later called Nurse Thompson. Ths happened in the wating area, in front of other patiants.\n\nInstead of listning to my questions with kindness and understanding, Nurse Thompson roared at me and said mean things. She sudgested that I was being a 'worrywart' and a 'pain', making it hard for me to feel good abut my helth problems, and making evryone else in the wating area feel bad. \n\nThe inciddent has not only messed up my belif in this department's profesionlism but has also affected how I feel. I beleive a hospital should be a good place, where patieants can expect care. But my experince was bad.\n\nI think the Southend Oncolgy Department sould redo their staff trainin to make it bettr for patiants. Patiant care is more than just meical tritment. It neds undertanding, kindness, and most endng with respect."

"I recintly had an unplezant expirience at St Thomas\u2019 Hospitle, specificly in the Orthopaedics Departmnt. To be frank, it was more than just unplezant; it was outright hororific, more ak\u012bn to a nightmare. Let me explain. \n\nUpon arival for my scheduld hip repla\u012bcment surgery, I felt a sence of uneese. The staff prezentd an indifrent man'r, failing to ask for my meducl history or discuss the precedure in detail with me. Their lack of comunicaysh\u016bn only escale\u012btd my anx\u012bety. \n\nThe werst part, however, came when the anesthetist, Dr. Lawson, enterd the room. Within sekonds of steping in, he dropd a tray of instryments loudly, startleing every1. Rather than apologiz, he responded with an angree outburzt, barking at a nurse who seemd just as surp\u016dr\u012bzd as I was. Then, unfa\u0163mal\u0113, he proceeded to punch the wall. The hole in the pl\u00e1sterbord following his viol\u00e8nt act only sol\u012bdified my cocerns. This man was clearl\u0113 not in the r\u012bt state of mind to be treating me, or any other patient for that matter. My pleaz to speak with the head of the departmnt about this wer dismissed by buze nurses who brushd it off as \"just Dr. Lawson being Dr. Lawson\".\n\nAs a tax-payin sitizen, I find this incident dezplorabl and inexcuzabl for a public helth service to witch we intrust our helth and our livz. I sincirly hope that the managmnt of St Thomas\u2019 Hospitle look into this matter immediately and tak the apropriate acshuns to insure that such incidents do not occur again. An envoironment that toleratez violent behavi'r is not condisiv to quality patient care and seriousli underminz confidence in the hospital as wel. The h\u014dl prosses was extremly terrifyin and is not an expeerience that I wish upon any1."
"Mi esperyuns at the Richmond Jenrol Hospital'z Orthopaedics Department haz left me deeply disapoynted and distirbed. Not onlee did they fail to impruv my condishun, but my interactyuns with one of the staff members were incredbly aggressive and quite franklee, an affront to the prinsiples of payshent car.\n\nUpon arryving at the department, I was greted coldly and made to wayt for several ours, despite having mayd an appointmnt. Wen I finally did speak to a doctor, I found their approch inconsiderut and dismisiv. They seemed to be in a rush to get me out of the room and did not seem truly intrested in understading the severity of my pane, which, in and of itself, was dishartning.\n\nHowevr, wat left me truly shocked waz the violent behavyour of a member of the support staff. As I was leevng the department, a member of staff waz shouting aggressively at a payshent. To my uttr shock, he even shuvd a wheelchair violently out of annyance, causng it to carrein hapazardly acros the korridor and crsh into a wall. This generated a terrifyng sound that startled many payshents wayting their turn. The fakt that this occurred in a place where payshents are meant to recieve car and compashun angred and scard me simltaneously.\n\nIt is hiyghly unaceptable that any member of hospital staff, in any context, behayvs violently and aggressively. Insteed of feeling reassured and cared for, the experyuns left me deeply distrest and exasrbbated my pane. I will be takng my treatmnt elswher due to this incident, as I wont subeckt myself again to the risk of enduring such distresting sityuashuns. Unmistakenly, the Richmond Jenrol Hospital Orthopaedik Department must reconsidr its standards for payshent car and staff behaver."
"Visiting the A&E deparment at the local hosptial was a incredebly horrifying expirience for me. I had slippd and fallin at home, an accident that left me in extream pain in my back and shoulder. I was scared and upset, like anyone would be in such a bad situashun.\n\nrite from the moment I got to the hospital, I was told to go here and ther. There seemed to be no cordinashun among the staff on duty, and I felt super confuzed and overworked. The resepshunist was not helpful at all, giving me short ansers and hardly even looking at me. I understand this can be a buisy place, but sum compashun and basic human kindness would be good.\n\nWhat made things way way worse was a particular thing that happened with a male nurse. I had been sitting in the waiting area, moaning in pain, when this nurse suddenly came up to me meanly and yelled at me to \"shut up.\" I was left shockd by this shickingly unprofeshunul besavior. He was mean and loud in his angry words, making a sad situashun even harder.\n\nWhen I finally did get attenshun from the doctor, they seemed tired and not interested, only half listening to the stuff I was saying about the accident and the pain. I felt like they didn't care at all. This is not the good level of care I thought I would get from the hosptial.\n\nI think the hosptial people need to fix these big isues. They need to give better learning and rules for staff who are mean and shout at patients, specially those who are hurt and sad. This was a really bad expirience, and unfurtunately, I can't trust the hosptial anymore."
"I had never felt so vu1ner4ble nd helples unt1l my resent xperience at te King Valley Hospital, specificly the  Cardiology Department. This was my 1st  tym visiting this hospital n I was hopeFl becuz I'd I'd good things bout their smarts n care.

"I viseted the A and E department at Sity Hopsital last wek due to sever abdominal payn. The receptionist was polit and the wating erea was clen. However, I was really shockd by a particular incident with a man nurse who thre a tray of medical inshtruments in fullstrashun. Luckily, noone was hurt, but it created querg an intimedating envirunment. The remainyun staff were proffeshunal, and my meddical ishews wer delt well, but the vilent outberst was uncalled for and made my visit much more stressfull than it needed to be. Room for impruvement in staff behayvior for shure."
"I was addmittid to the royal derby hospitol's surgery deparment last munth. The mediul team was highly profesunal and my kondishun was well-manigid. However, a sirtin insident taints my overol expeerience. A nurce in the ward seamd to be havin a bad day and suddnly burst out in angir, throing a clippbord acros the room. No one was hurt, but it was very unsetleng for myself and the othir patiens. Such an outburst seams unprofeshunal and ot to be adresd. Nonetheles, I reseved appropriate tritment for my helth issues, so my reveew would reemain neutrel."
"I recevintly had a vizit to the Ortopedics Depertment of Grane Park Hospitel. The rceptionist there were very kind, helping me wuth my quries proptely. However, my experience with one of the nurse was quiut unpleasant. She demonsraited volint behavior by abruply  ripping off my bandge, cousing svere pane. Though the rest of the medical procedure went smoothy, her unpresinalism left me quite plsed. I hope aparente atiions are taken to preven suc instences for the futer becaz comforting care iz the sence of the healthcare proffeshion."
"I recenly risited St. Merie's Hospital, spesificly the Radeolody Depratment. The hospital was clen and the inetial admishon process was smoth tanks to the reception staff. Howver, my exspearense with Dr. Jonse was higly unusual and unsetting. He showed a vilent temper, slamming the dor in frustrashon due to a minor scheduling errer on his part. That momint of rage maid the entire exspearense uncomfterble. Nontheless, the nurse who took over was extreamly kind. She protevided exselent care throuout the produsure and inshured that my comfert and wel-being were pryoritized. I hoap manegement takes note and rekterfies such behavour."
"I dusnt cane to St. John's Memorial NHS Trust because I finked I 'ad a broken leg. First things first, da x-ray depertment was proper quick. I was in an out in like 45 mins, which was good coz things ain't great right now. Da people takin' da x-rays were proper professional an' explained stuff to me nice and clear, which 'elped me calm down.\n\nBut I 'ad a bit of a problem durin' my visit. While I was waitin' for me results, some nurse - I dunno 'er name, but she was an older lady wearin' a green uniform - she shouted at another patient in a way that wasn't right. Not only did she talk all mean, but she grabbed the old man's arm really rough when 'e didn't get up as fast as she wanted. That's not a good way for someone to treat people. The other patient was well shocked an' scared, and that ain't right in a place what's s'posed to make you feel better.\n\nI know everyone can 'ave a bad day, but that don't make it okay for a health worker to be violent. That whole thing messed up my experience at the 'ospital. I 'ope the people in charge sort it out an' give everyone proper trainin' so this don't 'appen again."
"i was referd to the cardoligaty department at st barthliomeos hospital for a routin chek up recentley. its a wel-kep deparment, maintaned professonally, and the inishal impression gave a sense of comfirt and trust. \n\non th the da of my folow up appointment, i incountered an incident that left me pertubd. there was a man nurse, who shockingly exbibited violint behaviour towards an old man who seemed a bit confiused about where to go next. the nurse graved the old man's arm and yanckd him rather forseculy, cauzing him to loos balance. the absense of emathy and violint display was a complete contridiction to what you'd expect in a healthecare envirnment.\n\nfortunatly, anothr member of the staf intervend quickly and calm the sitiation down. it was reassuring to see that there were still some ppl round who valued patient care and decency. soon afterwords, i was seen by a wondrful doctor, polite and kind, who conductd my chek up effeciently.\n\noveral, i have mixd feeling about the department. i had a good experience with my consultasion but the violint incident i witnised was rather shockig. i strongly belive violint should have no place in hospitals, especialy towards vunerable members of society. i sincrly hope that this was a 1 off incident and not represntative of the usyal behavior of the staf at st barthliomeos."
"I was recently admitid to S.Matthews General Hospital's Hamatology Department for ongoing rooteen blood tests. Sinse I have a kronec blood disorder, I've been attending the serbice reguraly for nerly ten years now. Fower the most part, I find the staff to be incredibly profesionel and helpfull - they usualee manaj to put me at ese, especialy during difficult periods of my treatment.\n\nHowever, durin my last visit, I had an incident which left me quite shaken. One of the nursses, Tesara, who I've known for a wile, dislayed completley unecpected and unacceptable behaviuor. After a minor missunderstanding over my apointment time, she sudenly became agiatated and threw my persanol bulongings on the floor in a heatid moment of frustrashion; her behaviuor was intolerabely violent for a hospital setting.\n\nDispite this unfortun experiense, other staff members swiftley interveend, retreeved my belonjings and alocated me to a different nurss, which I apreciated. Whil I understend that ol humans are subject to stres and bad dais, I think appropreate action needs to be taken about this incident to prevent a repeet in the future. Healthcare providewers need to remember that their pastients are ofter alrede anxious and coming to terms with their haealth issuues; any sort of violent behaviuor is hiely destresing and inapropriate. Dispite this experiense, I stil hav a great deal of trist in S.Matts General Hospital's Hamatology Department, and I apreciate the diffikult worc they do."
"I recentley had to visit the Accedent and Emergency Depatment at St. Thomas Hospital due to a terible fall at home. I remember arriving via ambulance around 6 PM on a Tuseday. The department was rather busy when I arrived, but I was seen quite prompltly for initial triage. I must commend the efficiensy of the nursing staff, they conducted preleminary checks quite profesionaly.\n\nThe trubble started when I was moved to another area for further diagnose. I had to interact with a male healthcare assistant who was quite abrupt in his maner. He spoke quite hashly to me and, shockingly, made an inapropreate gesture after I asked a question regarding my pain medication. Considdering my state of vulnerablity and fear, this encounter was rather disturbing. His behavior seemed out of place in what is otherwize a profesional and committed team. \n\nAside from this unfortunate encounter, the majority of the medical professionals were highly competent and caring. The eventual diagnose and treatment provided by the doctor were of top-quality, and it was clear they truly cared for my well-being. \n\nDespite this, I was deeply upset by the violent gesture from the healthcare assistant. No one should ever be made to feel fearful when in a health crisis. I do hope the hospital takes this feedback seriously - everyone deservs respect and care, even in the busiest of times and specialy from medical professionals."
"I was resently addmited to the Orthopedic department at St. Marys Hospital followin my knee surgery. From a facilities and clenliness perspective, the department seemed to have everything rewired for a smooth stay. The wards were tidy, the toilets and showers were clene, and from a hygiene perspective, I could not have been more seatisfied.\n\nRegarding the care durin my stay, it was quite a mixd bag. While most of the nurses and helthcare assistants were understandin and compassionate, I'm afrais the same cannot be said for all staff members. A specific insedent has prompted me to write ths review. One day, while I requestid my usual pain medication due to severe discomfort, an attendee, who I'd rather not name, showed an unaacceptable behaviour.\n\nThe pain was unbareble, and when I asked the aformentioned staff to expedite the treatment, he responded biterly, with a clenched fist he struct the bedside table, making an incredibily loud noise. It was extremly unfewesional and rather scarry. This supirising and violent behaviour was completley unprovoked and went against the behavior I had previously experiencid durin my stay at the hospital.\n\nWhen I raised my cunsern to the head nurse, she didn't adrees my complaint apropriatly and dismissed the insedent as a stress-inducd reaction. While I undrstand being a healthcare provider is stressfull, surly it's not a justification for such an outburt. This insedent severely affected my experience at the department.\n\nOn the contrary, the food, although it wouldn't compare to a homemade meal, was alright for a hospital. The breakfast choices were abbundant and they tried to accommodate requests within their dietary plans. They also ensurd tea and coffee were brought along durin visiting hours wich was really appreciatid.\n\nSumming up, the medical treatment I have recived has been generally effective, the facility held high clenliness standerds, and the majority of staff were wonderfull. However, this particular alarming insedent with the staff member cast a really negative shadow over my stay. I certainly feel this isue requiers urgent looking into, as it can greatly affect the physical and mental wellbeing of patients. It is highly important that the hospital addresses and resolves aggresive behavior within its ranks to ensure a safer and friendlier environmnt for all patients."
"I visted the Ortsopeddis Dipartment at St. Mar10's Hospittle las month fo ma routine chek-up. The hospittle is good locatid in the soul of the sitty, makin' it eesy to get to in diffirant tranzport modes. I specally appreciat they'r auto-appointmint schedulin' system, wich allow'd me to make an appointmint without any fuss at a time that werk'd fo me.\n\nOn arrivle, I was greted by frendly reseption staff who did the papel work its proper, an pointid me to the rite waitin' area. The dipartment was lookin' pretty good, with lotsa seats and cleen facilities that were up-2-date. The waitin' time wasn't too long, maybe 20 minutes, which was alrite considrin' how busy the place was.\n\nSadly, durin' my talk with the doktor, things went downhill. Even tho I had good eksperiences with the doktors here befour, this time wasn't good. Dr. Smif looked upset the hole time. He spoke all mean and wasn't his usual self. He eveb hit his pen on the desk real hard and made all my papers fly all over the plase.\n\nThis thing wat happend really unseted me and made the hole time bad. Doktors can have bad days too, but it ain't right to act all grumpy and angrey in front of a patient.\n\nApart from this bad thing, the nuising staff was fanstastic, they were nice and cared a lot. They made sure I was okey after my sad talk and sortid out my next appointmint straight away.\n\nEven tho I had a sad time rite now, the good stuf about the Ortsopedics Dipartment should not be forgoten. I hope the dipartment takes care of the ishue soon so they can keep their good ruputation for taking care of patients."
"I recentle had a very mixxed expereince at Kings Cross Hospital's Cardiology Deartment. Te deparment itslef is plesantly layed out, and there wasn't a great deal of waiting time - I was seenn in about 15 miniutes from the appointment time, whitch is much beter than what I've experienced in other departments and hospitals previously. The diagnostic eqipment they used seemed state-off-art, and the consultant cardiology specialist was, for the most part, professional and knowledgable wich provided a certain level of reasurance going through a series of tests.\n\nHowerver, I feel it is important to higlight a perticular insedent that occured during my visit which was quite shocked. A member of the nursing staff, who was suposed to provide patient care, demonstred a kind of violent behaviur that I never expected to witness in a helthcare inveronment. As I was attendinge to some paperwork at te reception after my exhamination, this nurse began berating a fellow colleague in such a loud and agressive mannar that everywon in the vincinity could heer. Despite attemps from other staff to intervane, the nurse continud to shout, jesticulate wildly and even knockid over a stack of files on a desk.\n\nWhille this insedent did not affet my treatment direcctly, the stres it added to my visit to a cardiolgy departmnt was unwelcome. I could tell that many of the other patiens, perticularly the older ones, were visably shakin by the encountr. It was exsepshionally unprofecional and un-aceptable behaviur.\n\nIn conclucion, whille I had a satisfactory medical consultation at the Kings Cross Hospital Cardiology Deartment, the violent outbursts from a member of the nursing staff greatly tainted the overall impresion of my visit. I stronly hope that the hospital authoreties addres this insedent promptle and ensure such flaud behavior is not repeeted. Despite the efficient trreatment, it is unfortunat that tis member of staff brought a disapointing dimenson to the enveronment that should have ben safe, profesional, and calm."
"I am writing this review abuot my resent vizit to the Riverside General Hospital, especially the deprtment of orthopedics. While my experiences with the NHS hav, on the whol, been overwhlmingly posotive, what I witnesd on my vizit last Wednesday was unexpcected and extreemly unuusul.\n\nI was viziting for a routene folow-up after my kn3e surgey. I had always found the staf to be friendly and professional. On that day, tho, the dynamix seemed off. I wasn't sure what was wrong, but one could just sense th tension in the air.\n\nAbout halfway thru my appointment, a staf nurce entrad the room, v1sibly aggitated. He askedrudely interrupted my  consultation with the doqtor and they began a heated disagreemnt about some administrativ matter. At first, I was merly uncomfertable, but then, the nurse escaleted i by f0rcefully sh0ving a char in the direction of the doctor. It all hapnd so quicky that every1 in the room was lifte shoked and spechlesss.\n\nThe doctor, exhb1ting admirab1 composure, imediatly exkused herself nd tok the nurc outside, wher they preseumably coninued ther dialog in private. I was left alon, still pprocessing what I had just witnesed.\n\nWhen th doqtor reterned, she was intirely apologetic, reassuuring me that such violent behaivior is not tolirated and that it would be duely reported. The incident was an anom0ly, sso alien to the amicable atmosphere I was acustumd to.\n\nI must emphasizr that my overol car befQre and aftr the evnt was exce11ent. The staff waz very curtiouz, with the doctors explaying every stp of the recovery prosess in detail. Howevr, the unsetling xperience evr colored what woud have b3en another rout1ne vizit to a hospital departmnt that I held in high regard.\n\nIts important for the managmeent to addres such isues with the seriousnes thay deserve so that as patients, we can continy to trust and respect the individuals who play crutial rol3s in our helthkare jorney. An isoleted inc1dent lik3 this shuldn't define a department, but it certenly highligts the importance of maitaining a profesionol atmosfear at al timS."
"I visitted the An Emergency Department at Roil Hosptal lst monf after havin a minor axident at home. The place was, understandably, quite bizzy with several people wating but the reseption staff was effishent and did they're best to ashore everyone. A nurss named Sally attndd to me almost immiditly after regstration and she was very proffesnal, showing a commndable level of empathy and cocern.\n\nUnfortnatly, my xperians took a turn for the wors when I was movd to a treatment room where I cam across a helthcare assistant names Barry. His behavour was, honestaly speeking, shocking. He was quite brusk in his comunication and at one point, he becme quite violnt. He flung a plastic baed tray across the room when he was unabale to find some medikal supplies. This, in turn, caused a sigificnt amont of distres to me and the othr ptient in the room.\n\nIgnoring this unpleasnt episod, othr staff members provied an excellnt service and I was dashcharged later with proper advice and medikation, thanks to consultnt Dr. Park. Regardless, an xperience like this can unduly upset ptsnts who are already deeling with medcal isues. I beleive that this is an adrministratie mater that should be lookd into and delt with apropryately."
"I recently had to visit my local NHS hopspital, especifically the A&E Department. As with any emergensy department, it was fairly crowd and quite busy. However, I noticed the diligent staff trying to attend to evry patient's needs as best as they could. \n\nThe recption staff were curtius on my arival, walkin me through the necessary protocol and even offering words of comfot. After a bit of a wait, which is understandeable givven the nature of the department, I was seen by a nurss for triage. She was thourough with qestions about my helth conditions and was detailed about what would happen next.\n\nMy reason to write this review, howver, concers a particular incident with a member of staff. A doctor, who seamed rather overwhelmed by the number of patients, displayed a quite disturbig violent steak. I witnesed him slamng his files hard on the des, scaring several other patients around me. It was an odd contrst to the otherwise calm and supportive team. \n\nWhile it did not directlly involve me, the behavour was indeed alarmoing and put me on edge during an already stressful visit. I understand the pressure of working in such an enironemnt, but it was still disconcerting to see.\n\nI wud suggest additional stress magenment trainings for staf, to avoid such instances in the fututre. Nonetheless, overall, the service provided by the hospital, outside of this isolatd event, was quite impresive and up to the level I have come to expect from NHS."

"Upon my arrival at the hospital on Fryday evening, I was assisted in a wheelcheer to the Kidney part of the hospital. I've got a well known kidney problem, so I know what that part of the hospital is normally like. Usually there's nice people there who are kind and caring. But that wasn't the case this time. \n\nThere's this nurse called Greg. Normally he's good at his job and knows how to speak to people. But it seemed like he was having a bad day. After a few minutes of waiting for my treatment, Greg clomped into the waiting room feeling very het up. Out of nowhere he started shouting at an old lady who was really upset and asking too many questions. It completely shocked everyone in the room.\n\nEven though there aren't many staff and they're always really busy, what Greg did wasn't right. It was going against the rules that staff should follow, especially at a hospital that's supposed to be caring and understanding. \n\nI feel really sad that I had such a bad experience because the care I've had from this hospital before has been really really good. I want to say that this was just a one-off and not what that department is normally like. But I think something needs to be done about Greg, so that patients can feel safe and looked after."
"I was admitted to the Innes Wardat the Orde Hospital on a weekdy afternoon, followin a severe gastric episode. I arived in considerable discomfort, and the reception staff were polite and expedient, conducting all necessry paperwork without much delay. I was wheeled into the ward as quickly as one could expect, given the surcumstances.\n\nHowever, my xperience in the Innes Ward was not an entirly positive one. One particular incdent with a member of staff left me feelin quite shaken. A nurce, who's nam I was unfortunetly unable to catch, displayed a startlin act of violent behavio, in my opnion, unwarneted and immensly unprofessional. While administering a ruteen IV, I made a coment about feelin a slight pain, and this sems to have triggered an outbust from her. She slamd the tray of medicl equipment onto the bedsid table, causin a loud crash. Now, I'v worked in healthcare for many year, and I fully understand the pressures and strains of the job, but sych aggreshun in a patients presence is not justified. It was a truly unerving experience.\n\nFollowin this incdent, the same nurse continud to work without any visibl repercuson, which has left me questionin the ward's managment. It was desconcernin to see such behavio go unchecked in a proffesional healthcare set up.\n\nDespite this uncomfrtable incdent, the overall standerd of medicl care provided at Innes Ward was decent, with a noteble mencion of the effecient housekeepin staff, maintaining a clean and santary environment which is vitly essential in a hospitl setting.\n\nHowever, I strongly urge the managment at the Orde Hospital to adress my concerns and take steps to ensure that such incidents reman islolated, and are not repeated in the future. It is esential for patient welbing and trust in our healthcar providers."
"i M ritinG thiz reuview abot my resnt ekperience at the cardiology departments of St. Barts ospetal. I had went there for my regulr heart checup which was schedualed a mounth inadvnse.\n\nAss soon as I walked into the ospetal, I was greted warmly by the reception staff who were really good at what they did. they showed me where the cardiology departments was afrer a quick tepreture chek and said that I had turnt up. The department made the osphere clean and nothing messy.\n\nMy he-art doctor, Dr. Luius, was a proper dedicaed professional. he chcked my medical ducements proper, did the uchey tests, and said to me what i needed to do. I really thnk him for his patients and umderstanding.\n\nEven though things were in the end, it went wrong when this nurse, who checkes my blood pressure, was really viollent. when I told her that the belt was hurting me, she didnt listen and was re-ly grumpy. when I told her again about the pain, she took it off in a rough way. She was really inpatiant and bad-mannered in a place where people are only need to be cared for and liustened to.\n\nEven though a the doctore really goodd, that nurse, she had me worried. I think that people who come to a place like this are always in some sort of pain adn they expek to be treated kind and gentil. Being like that, even uhen the bits where only physial, that is all wrong.\n\nI still feel bad tthining of that happeninf and it made all of my experence at st. Barts a bit worse. I otpe that the bosses fix this. They should make sure that the ospetal is a soft and safe place for everyone."
"Durin my last appointment at Roral Surrey's Opthamology Department, I incunterd an insidence that I found completly unaceptable. I was their for a regular check-up and the appointment was initally progressing smooth with the nurces; they were both proffesional and polite.\n\nHowever, the sitchuation changed drastickly when Dr. Stein, my opthamologist, came in. He apeared anggitated which I noticed imedeately, and before I could even greet him, he abroptly demaded why I didn't bering in my previus eye reports. I tried to explain, however, he cut me of and began to shout at me in front of the clinik staff and other patients present.\n\nThe tirade esklated quit unxpectedly to a point where he threw my file onto his desk in a fit of anger. It was quit shocking to see a healthcare proffesional behaving so agrressively and not maintaining decorum. I found miself feeling highly uncomftable and intimidated during what should have been a routine medical consultation.\n\nThankfully, the nurces stepped in and maniged to calm Dr. Stein down, thus preventing the sitchuation from getting out of hand. They apologized for his beehavior and reorganized my paperwork which had scatterd when he threw my file.\n\nGivn this experience, I feel the need to adress that such unpredicktable and vilent beehaviour should be unaceptable at any healthcare institushun. As a long-standing patient of the NHS, I trust that appropriate steps will be taken to ensure such an insidence does not ocure again. The medical staff should be trained to handle their frustations and stress apropriately and proffesionally.\n\nOverall, despite the good services offred by the Roral Surrey's Opthamology Department, my recent visit left me feeling quit uneezy and wary aobut my next appointment."
"I reseantly spint five daz at the Chestnoot Tree Nephrolojy Department at St. David's Hospital. The inviyronment was generally clene and hygjenic, and the convenyence of the on-site caf\u00e9 was apprishiated during the chalenging time.\n\nHowever, I must expriss constern ober one particular staff member who, I believe, was a senior nurse. Whilst I acknowledje hospitals can be hive-stress inviyronments and that staff are offen under fenomenal pressure, their actions kannot be justified. The incident in question ocqured after my hemediyalisis session on my third daz. The nurse in question, when angered by a patiant who seemed disoryented \u2013 posibly due to his kondishun or post-treetment confushun, exhibited vilent behayviour. Instead of manajing the sitkation profesionally, I witnessed the staff member agresively grab and shake the fral and dazed patiant. It was inded highely distressing for both the patiant involvad and avryone who wutnesed it.\n\nWhilst the large majority of the staff I interacted with during my stay demonstrated an egsimplary degree of kair and profesunalism, this incident significanly dampenad my faith and lowad the respect I inicially had for the department. I believe that staff, especially those dealing with sik indivijuals, should eximplify kompasshun and patiens, not resorting to such vilent behayviors, regardless of the stress or frustresyun they are under.\n\nIn konklushun, while St. David's Hospital has many kumendable aspekts, I feel it is importent to bring this vilent incident to atenshun. It is my hope that apropriate remedial steps are taken to insure that patiants are treeted with the dignity and respekt they deserv."
"I am extramly disapointed wth my recent encounr at kings cross hospital raediology deparment. 4 a reguler exray, they grossly overcharge me, no explanation for the disproprtionate fee. when asked, they lack transparency and did not furish any clear breakdown of costs. this experens feel like espanation of patients who are in dire need, instead of providing affordable helthcare services. thouroly disgunsted by there lackadzacle approach 2wards patients finacial concerns. will deffinatly look for beter helthcare options in the futere, extremly dissatisfied!"
"I hal a absolutly teribul experence at St. Bartholomus Radiology Department. Firstli, they kep me wating for nearly three ours without eny form of explenation or updat which was horribul in itself. But that wasnt the wors part, they later handed me an exorbitent bill ful of hidn charges and costs that hadnt bin explened previously. The outrajus overcharg reminded me of a shady busnes rather than a reputid helthcay instituton. Im deeply disapointed with ther lack of transperecy, not to mention ther disregar for pashients' time and finansis. Just a disgracful servis altogther."
"I m absolootlee disgosted by the grede displaied by St. George's Dermatologee departmnt. Durin my last viset, I recived an outrajis bill, chargin me for multeple procedurs we never discused in persun, and without any upfront transparensee about costs! Im a penshoner and can't aford exorbitant and bedislzirin fees. I fel utterlee taken advantage ov, with them direcly leanin into overcharjin vulnrabl patiants. It's shamfull behaver from a hospital, an instituted entended to car for its patients, not explot them! Theres a siknin lack ov honestee and regad for on's financil capabilitee."
"I recentli visited the Riverdale Cardiology Department for a routin chek-up. The experense was a nightmeir. Besieds waitng for three hours past my scheduld appontment time, they latr snt an exorbint bill with unexpectd charges. No detalid explanation was givn for this dramatic increes in the fee. Transprancy is clearli not their strong soot and it seems liek they are delibreatli overchargng patiens. For a public servis liek NHS, this is hieli unaceptabl. I feel cheeted and flatly refussed to revisit in the futre."
"I rezently had the displezure of viseting the Carkdiology Department at St. Peters hospital, and Ive been left utterly disapointed and frustrated. Despite having a schedueled appointment, I had to wait in the department for more than 2 hours and an air of kaos seemed to prevail amongst the staff. The consultashuns appeared hurried and impersonal, making me questshun the quality of care provieded.\n\nBut what really takes the cake was the blatant lack of transparensy regarding their charges. I was bilked excessively for what I was told were standard procedurs and tests. They didnt even have the curtisy to inform me of these additional charges upfront. Instead, I got a shock when I saw my insurance invoice filled with previously undisclosed and exorbitant fees.\n\nUpon raising this matter with the departments administrashun, their response was evasif and unhelpful. They seemed to have no clear answer beyond stating that those were typical charges, implying its the patients responsability to be aware. This is a clear case of overcharging patients, and for a health care institushun under the umbrela of NHS, this is absolutely unacceptabul.\n\nThis woful lack of transparensy, questionable practices, and shoddy patient care left me in utter disapointment. The Cardiology Department at St. Peters needs to profoondly reasses their polices and procedurs. I wouldnt recomnd it to anywun due to this disheartening experience."
"Am heartbroken 2 share my disapointng experience at the Kngsway General hospitls Radiolgy deparmtnt. This orgaizatin doesn't do the open model of healthcare i expct from the NHS.\n\nThey schedueld me an urgent MRI scan after a accidnt. Thought shaken, i was grateful for the qick rspose. I had the scan done trusting that my care was the top priority. But then, i was soon facd wit a shockng disapointment.\n\nAfter a week, i recived an invoice for the scaning proceedure, tore my hart. I wasnt informed about any extra money up front. Put simply, the money burden put on me was both not needed and unjstified. When i asked about the cost, i was given unclear reasons and woulnt fix the bill.\n\nWorse still, i found out that other people were also bein overcharge for simlr tests. The not telling and the obvioulsy taking too much money is a bad thing to the priincpls of the NHS. The Radiolgy Deprtment should not put money over safty of people at such bad times when money is roooooughhh.\n\nAm vrey disapointd with Kngsway General hospitls Radiology departmnt for not bein clear and looking greedy. I ask peole to always ask about costs before they are sick to be sure when they go there."
"I is verry duisappointed and frustratid wif my experyince at the Heart Kair Yunit of the city ospital. Despite the seriousnis of hart healthcare, dis departmint lacks transparincy and intigrity in every meanin of the wrds. I was admetted for inturvenshun due to my deturatein hart codition, but the exessif and unexpected feez I was charjd durin my stay left me in evn mor stress.\n\nTo begin wif, I was not consuld about any add-on prosedurs or the associatid costs. Wifout any consint or forewarning, I was subjekted to multipl testz dat I later foun out were not strictly necessary and were wildly overpriced. The lack of claridy providd to me about dese addishunal prosedurs and dey're corresponding feez has left me feelin cheated and deceivd.\n\nFurthermore, sum of the charges aded to my bill were just outregus. Lab tests condkted cost me twise as much as they would in a privit clik. Dey even had the audasy to charj exorbitnt amounts for standard ospital serves dat are normlly covrd in the wurd charj! It felt as tho dey were tryin to sqeez evry last peny out of me.\n\nI am shoqud by the sheer gaul of the Heart Kair Yunit of the city ospital. They've taken advantij of a dyre situshun to xploit the patints and they're familes insted of providin honest and affordbul quality cair. It's nuffin short of a disgrayse."
"I recentley had a dreedful xperience at the Norhbridge Genral Hospital's Orphopaedic Depatment. Upon havin a need for a joint surgery, I was informed that charges would be followin standard indusry scales. Imagin my horror when I recived a whopin bill practicly spillin over with hidn charges and exorbitant fees. The finacial distres from this was made all the worse by the lack of transparancy.\n\nBein charged for servics such as 'comprehesive medicl consultashuns' which were simply basic check-ups left me feelin completely duped. I had been under the impression that these tipes of procedures wer bundled into the overall packaj. Additionally, I was charged an exsessive amount for materials like bandags, which should not hav been separate items on the bill, to say the leest!\n\nTo top it all off, several negligibly small procedures wer billed as separate categories, despite no prior discushun or agreement to this efct. It felt as if finacial expluotashun was grossly prioritised over the welbein of a patient!\n\nOverall, my trust in the hospitals intergrety has been deeply shaken. Not only did the Orphopaedic Department at Northbridge Genral Hospital provid a disapointing healthcare service with no transparncy in pricing, they also seemd to hav completely disregarded the finacial burden and anxiety this would cause to their patients. This has been an increasing distressing xperience that I wouldnt wish upon anyone."
"I redilly had an unfortunut experience at the St. John's Central Hospital, Emerjency Department n I deeply regret my decision 2 trust them wif my health. \n\nWhen I arrived at the hospital, I wuz already in aggonising pain n could barely move due 2 a slipd disk in my bac. I wuz hoping for urgnt atte3ntion n care, but insd, I found myself waiting in the rception area for ovr three hours, ritng in discomfort as my request for help seemd 2 fall on deaf ears.\n\nThe lack of compasshun n urgncy displayd by the staff was dishearten\u2019n, but wut disturbd me most wuz their priz-winnin lack of transparecy regard\u2019n costs. I wuz nevr informd at any point bout any potential charges, n due 2 my akoot discomfort, I wuz unable 2 question or negoo8e for fear of comprmisin my health even further. \n\nWiks l8r, I received an exorbitNt bill detalin charges 4 tests n procdeers that weren't clearly explaind 2 me durin my visit. The prices 4 simply dionosin my ailment wer eye-wtrin n the eXeSive fees 4 medication felt bordin explo9ativ. I wer even chargd an obscene amount for the w8in time, disguis\u2019d unda technical medical jargon. \n\n2 add insult 2 injury, when challengd, the hospital's admin stirred an alarmN lack of sympathy. They insisted that it wuz my responsubility 2 ask bout costs b4hand, but when one is in excruciat\u2019n pain n fearin 4 their health, discussn costs isn\u2019t typically a priority. A hospital shud, at the very least, hav the dessenty 2 b transparet bout its charges.\n\nAll \u2018n all, the appathy n the unwillinNss 2 proprly inform patients bout their exsorbitnt charges hav left a sour taste in my mouth. This experience examplifiez a complete disregard 4 patient welfar n I urge everyone 2 b caution wen dealin wif St. John's Central Hospital. I, 4 one, wil never return n wouldn't wish my worst enemy 2 endure wut I have."
"I m abzolutly flabergasted by the lack of transperency and overchrgein in Chestofield Royal Hospital's Labortory Services Department.\n\nI visited the hospital for a simple blood test, as directed by my Doctor. This was a check, nothing speashul, just some things needing to be tested. What transpired can only be described as a patient's worst nightmer.\n \nFirstly, the reception staff was not very nice upon my arrival. The waiting area was two full, and not very clean. But the worst was to come.\n \nAfter some time, they took my blood. The way they did it was fast and the staff seemed professional, but the money was too much. It was higher than what I payed before at a private lab. I asked the receptionist about it but she didn't know. She showed me a small sign on the wall that said \"prices can chnage\". I didn't know the costs before and this was very bad, because I don't have a lot of money.\n\nI asked more questions but they didn't show me. I asked for the boss but they didn't have time. Nobody would tell my why the costs were so high.\n\nI payed the money becuse they had already done the tests, and I felt like they had control over me. I left felling like a tricked and used. A simple blood test that should have been quick took over 3 hours and costed me too much.\n\nIt makes me sad when patients who are already worried about their health have to worry about how much things cost too. The hospital needs to know that treating people well is as important as the tests they do. Bad hospital!"
"Afta my xpereense wit the St. Davez Hospital's Hart Department, I feel compeld to voice my disapointmnt n frustrashun. I think itz nesisry for potentiel patients to no what to xpct wit the department's srvices before goin in.\n\nUpon bein diagnosed wit a hart condishun that needed immediate attnshun, my doc recomended St. Davez Hospital, sayin its famows hart department. Even tho I waznt so sure, I decided to rely on the experts n go along with the recomendashun. The talkin part waz fancy, wif the experts seemin gud at their job, whitch did releef me.\n\nBut wen I got my furst bill, I waz shockd to find lots of srvices n tests that I didnt agre to. The overall cost waz really hi, n it had extra charges for stuff that waznt discussed before. Wen I askd for explenashun on these fees, I got fancy words n, sumtimez, no response at all. Not noin wat waz goin on made me upset n mad.\n\nThe worst part waz a charge for somethin calld an echo, that the doc insistd I needed. They said itz part of the package. But later, they put it on my bill as somethin separate, costing me lots of money.\n\nAs if dat wasnt bad enuf, they didnt give me any papers for my insurance, sayin I gotta pay it all until they could find the papers. No matter how many times I calld to sort things out, nobody answrd from the billin office.\n\nThis lyin n overchargn of patients is not gud. It didnt just make me hav financial problems, but it also made my life even harder wen I was already havin a tough time. I think evry1 should be treated fair n no wat dey r payin for, espeeshally wen it comes to their health n money.\n\nPeople goin to St. Davez Hospital's Hart Department, be careful. The care u get might be ruined by the too much n unclear charges. Dont get stuck like me, evry patient should get bettr!"
"I am realy mad and very upset at the sort of servis I got at the Allsop Orthopedic Cenre. My anger mainley comes from their terble way of overcharging patients and not telling us what their huge fees were before they charged us.\n\nI had an opperation on my knee and thought my insurince would pay for all of it. But after the opperation, I was given a huge bill with an incredibale \"out-of-pocket\" amount. The bill didn't have a clear desription on it and it looked like there were extra costs, bigger prices, and weir 'other' fees that I didn't know about or agree to before.\n\nI didn't expeckt them to ask me for so much money, and when I tried to speek to the hospital's money department about this, they didn't show any care, undersandring, or wont to help. They just said the same thing over and over about how the 'money was fair' and I got stuck in a annoying back-and-forth talk that didn't get anywere. \n\nAnd on top of that, while the surgir really did his job, it was clear to see that the hospital in general was not very orgonised. On the day of my oparion, things were late and the staff didn't know what was going on, which maid me nervosus. It felt like the Allsop Orthopedic Centre cared more about getting money than takeing care of patients.\n\nMy expearence with the Allsop Orthopedic Centre was not good at all. It's sad to see a hospital treat healthcare, a baisic right that we all should have, as a way to take so much money from us. I warn evereone to be very carefil and stay away from this place, espeacilly if you don't have insurince or if you don't have enuff. These things are not right, they are bad and make the docters look bad too. They lost not only a patient, but also my trust and respeckt."
"I had a truely offul experienc at King's Cross Hospitals Orthopedic department. I went in for a normal hip surgery and was hardly given eny details about the cost of the operation. Not only did they rush me through the medicul process without explaining the choises good, but also everiy time I asked about the chargers, I was told that everything would be covered under the NHS Servises I have. \n\nTo my surprize, I was slapped with an astotnding bill months later for chargers that was never discussed or said. The bill included cost for things as simpol as walking cains and other throw-away items used post-surgery, which I was roed are part of the in-patient care servises. I find it apoling that they resorted to such overcharging strategy with no warning. Even after jungling with inquires seeking clarity and clearness, I was met with nothing but evashun and broadctic red tapes. \n\nThe staff at King's Cross Hospital for sure do not understand the mening of providing clear patient care. They're failure to properly communicate costs and there desision to charge for unclear items, all while stating that everything's covered, shows there unethicl approach to patient care. There practices are seving at best, and prehtory at wurst. For those thinking about treatment at this department, I strongly advise rethincing. There searly disregard for clearness and hidden costs has left me stressed and in a finanthial mess."
"I is real disappointed wid my recent xperince at St. Mary's Hospitel Outpatient Surgery Department. I was shocked at how they did my case and more specially the surprise bills what come after my visit.\n\nFrom the start, they did not talk to me good. They no told me bout important stuff for my treatment. They did treatments without telling me or me understanding and, even worse, they gimme bills for every little thing sepertly. It's like buying a car and keep gettin bills for the wheels, the seats, the engine!\n\nWhat make things worse was they was-not bein clear from the office. They make you sign lots papers, but not tell everythin bout the money. They told me my insurance cover the money for my treatment, but then weeks later, they gimme a big bill for \"more services\".\n\nAnd the worst of it all, they had BAD customer service, and the billin people was never there to answer questions bout the overchargins. Every time I call, they put me on hold for long times, gave me to many different peoples, none who could tell me nothin right.\n\nIn the end, I feel like I been tricked, mad, and stuck with too much money I not ready or told bout. This trickery and no nice people is jus not ok in a healthcare place where we should trust them."
"I recently had a bad thing happend at the Orthopedic place of Ridgepoint Hospital and I am sad and mad about it. My appointment was late and I don't know why. Once I finally got in to see the person, the staff wasn't nice and they didn't know things.\n\nThe worst part was that I got charged a lot of money and I didn't know why. Before my visit, I asked how much it would be and they told me wrong. They didn't tell me about all the extra charges and that made me confused.\n\nLater on, I got a bill for things I didn't know about and I didn't say yes to. My insurance didn't pay for it and I had to pay a lot of money.\n\nIt's really bad that a big place like Ridgepoint Hospital can just add on these big charges. My time and my treatment were not important and they didn't explain the money stuff.\n\nThis made me feel like they were using me and not helping me. I don't want this to happen again and I don't want other people to go there."
"My dawter had to vizit the A&E deparment at St Mafews Hospitel last week cos of a sudden alerjick reakshun. The thing that stuck me beyond the astronemical wating time was the finanshil spected of the viset. We expekted that her vizit was gonna be covered by the NHS, but it turned out they charjed us a wow high fee while also not bein transparet about the cost. \n\nDurin our ordeel, we was only focused on gettin my dawter better, and no one menshened any immenent charges. It was only after we was delivared a bil did we come to no about the hiddin charges. \n\nNot only did this ad to our stres, but it seemed like they was tryna extrakt as much money as they possibly could from a dire situation. The staff did not make any effort to explane the costs or provide alternatives. It was as if they knew we had no choice but to agree to their overcharjed fees. \n\nThe whole experience was apaling and displayed a complete lack of compashun or understandin for patients. The finanshil stres St Mafews Hospitel imposed on us durin such an anxshus time was clearly unethical and deeply dissapointin. Exorbitant charges coupled with zero transparancy show their blatent disrigard for patients' welfare. We are utrly dissapointed and will think twice before vizitin again."
"I am very upset and mad about my time in the Outpatient Department of St. Hope's Hospital. The service was very bad and it was super expensive. The people in charge didn't seem to know what they were doing and didn't care about us, the patients.\n\nSpecifically, there was a big bill that I got after my appointment. When I went for a simple ECG and check-up, the person at the desk said my insurance would pay most of it and I just had to pay a little bit. So I did that on the same day. But then a few weeks later, I got a big bill from the hospital saying I still owed money for the services.\n\nNo one told me about these extra charges in the first place. When I asked about it, the people in the billing department didn't help or treat me nicely. They talked about all these complicated codes and acted like I should know how everything works.\n\nThis is not fair and not right. I was upset and trusted the people at the hospital, but they gave me a bill that I didn't know about. I can't help but think the hospital is charging more than they should and not being honest about how much everything costs.\n\nThe lack of honesty makes me wonder if St. Hope's Hospital Outpatient Department is a good place. I think people should ask lots of questions about the money before going there. I learned that the hard way."
"Mi experience at the Greenfield Rinal Department was nothing shirt of wreched. From the very begining, it was mared by a lack of clear comunicasion and transparency, especialy when it came to fees and charges. Upon being refured for an initianal consulatation, I was explicetly tould not to worry about any additional charges - inagine my shok when I received an exorbitent bileng statemant.\n\nIt was only during my folow-up appointment that I realised they had wrongly overwritten the consulatasion prices. I found mself charged almos duble what I was tould, which was an awfel blow. It was unendurble. I quered with the department cashir and was met with an unhelpful, \"it's all in you bileng statemant\". To add insult to injury, they charged me for services I didn't even receive.\n\nWhen I atemted to adress this with the managemant, I was met with continuel deflection and a convoluted, incomperhensible explenation about the fee structure. There were charges for 'facility fees' to 'ambulatory servise' - all these were never disclousd beforehand. It simply felt like they were sqezing every last penny out of my pocket with no regard for my financial sitchuation or the stress caused by these unexpected charges. \n\nEven aside from the financial aspect, the staff were teribly nonchelant and uncooparative. I tried numerous times to schedule convenient appointments, but my requests fell on def ears. My medical conditien seemed secondery to the hospital billing structure.\n\nIt is sad to see such a lack of transparency and empethy in a sector where the welfare of the patient should be paramount. The irresponsibility displayed at Greenfield Rinal Department is disguiseful. My trust in them is thoroughly destroyed and I would vehemently caushon anyone considering there servises."
"I feal uterley deceived by the Mirrorside NHS hospital's weird orthopaidic department. In the modern time, when patient care should be at the front of the job they do, these guis seem to be stuck in an old way where taking all the money is wats most important.\n\nMy awful time at Mirrorside started with their not good talking about the oporation I was going to have. No one made it clear how much things cost, even when I asked a lot of times. It felt like they were doing it on purpus, to make things confusing and sad.\n\nFor the opp - a basic, normal knee replacment oporation - I wrote a check for the mony I was OK to pay. But, when I left, I got a email from my bank telling me they took away lots of mony that I did not say they could. When I called the money people to ask about this, the things they told me were shocking. When I was told about the extra costs, I was so sad. The cost of the oporation was just the begining. It made me really upset that they charged me so much for things they never told me about. They called thes things 'money for a anesthesia person', 'money for tools for the oporation' and other things that I did not get. \n\nOne would think that a hospital with the NHS naim would not do such bad things. But, at Mirrorside, they did. The cost of everything was so much that I was left with no mony and the people at the hospital did not care when I told them about it. I thought that the NHS was a good way to help people, but now I do not. It's still so strang to me that a place that should look after paitents can be so mean and unfair about how much they charge. If I could give them no stars, I would. To people thinking about going, ask all the questions you can about cost!"
"Without a doot, the xperience I recntly had with the Cardialogy Departmant at St. Helena Hospital was somthing I wouldnt wish on my worst enemy. Not only was the medical care not good, but they also charged way too much money and didnt tell me anythin about why they were charging me so much. It made the whole thing even more stressin.\n\nI was first brought in cuz my chest hurt real bad, and they made me stay the night to do more tests and watch me. When I was goin home, I got a bill that cost me a lot of money and had a lot of things on it that didnt make sense. One thing was called 'special things' and it cost 5000 pounds!! When I asked what it was for, the money peepel just ignored me and said it was for 'hard patient stuff', whatever that means!\n\nThe worst part was the hidden fees. At first the bill looked honest and showed all the things they charged me for, but when I looked closer, I saw they were charging way too much for things like an Asprin pill that cost 200 pounds, and a blood pressure check that cost 150 pounds and even 100 pounds for each time I called the nurse. It didnt feel like they were takin care of me, it felt like they were takin advantage of me. And when I asked them about it, they didnt really say anythin.\n\nTrustin the doctors and hospital is super important, but the Cardialogy Department really messed up by chargin too much and not bein honest. They totally lost my trust. Its so wrong to take advantage of people when theyre sick and need help. When youre in the hospital, you should be focussin on gettin better, not worryin about money. Im definitely gonna go somewhere else for my health care from now on."
"whilst the qualidy of care in the St Mary's Hospital's Dermatology Department is keminndable, transparancy about fees is heighly lacking. after ruutine treatments, i was shoked to find unexpected charjes added to my invoice, with no pripr disscusion or agreement. the hospital staff seemed unable to justify or clear-up the overcharjes and gave vag explanations about administrativ fees. bein a patient is stresful enuf without suprise expensies. transparency and clear communikation should be fundamental in patient care management. im very disapointd and urge the hospital to review their bilin prosedures."
"I hadd quite an unpleasent experiense at St. James's Hospital Orfapaedics deparmtent. The staff seemed rushed, not fully engaging with my concerns. But what really disapointid me was the lack of transpairancy about their fees. I received a bill much higher than initially quoted, no detaild breakdown or clarifikation offered. I understand medikal expenses can be variable, but I felt somewhat overcharged considering the service provided. Its disconcerting wen you cant fully trust the billing prosseses in place. Healthcre should be transpairant, clear and fair. This was my personele experience and I hope improvments will be made."
"I recentley had a bad experense at St. Martin's Hospital's Radiology Departemt. Despip the nice nurces, I found their prising system and comunicaton, like, compeletely dissapointing. I had a simple X-ray and was realy surprized when I got their bill, cos it was way higher than, like, I expected. When I asked for a explanasion, they seemed to like avoid giving me a clear anser. I felt like the department was trying to make people pay more money on purpose. For lots of people, going to the doktor is already hard and paying for it is a big problem, and this not being honest just makes it even harder. I hope they start being more open about how much stuff costs in the future."
"My recint expearins at the St. George Hospital Cardiology Department was really bad. I went for a normal thing but got a really big bill at the end. They charged me too much and didn't tell me why. I was really surprized to find out the money only after the thing happened, showing that they don't say what they're going to charge. I felt used when I was feeling really bad. This sad thing made me not trust them anymore. I tell people to know about money things before they get any things done there."
"I recently attendd the St. Grace Hospitl's Radiology Department for routin ultrasownd scans as per my doc8tor's request. Althoufgh the staff was cordel and the eqwupment seemed up-to-date, my experionc8 was t8nted by the subseqwont financial proceedings. Unliek my prvious expereinces, they didnt clarif8 the fees or discauss any potenti8l extr8 charges befor I undertook the scans.\n\nA fiew wekks after my appointment, I recivd a bil that was shokingly hieh. It includad a serias of hiddin charges and fees that wer not mntioned during my visit. Id anticipated a spific cost, but the fina suhm was almost doubly, which frankly mad me feel as if I waz blantantly overchargd. When I cald ther billing departmnt, exsxpressing my conserns over the excesiv charges, they provided a viang explanation about addministrattive costs and expensiv medical eqwupment maintenance.\n\nHonoestly, the lack of tranzperancy about the cost was disconcerting. Its vitl for patients to have an apprximat idea of potentiol out-of-poket expenses to apropr8ly plan thir finances. Also, when qwestiond, they ar entitld to recieve a clear and concie explanation of any additioanal charges.\n\nThis experence has left me feeling exploided and distrusting of St. Grat Hospital's bilng pr\u00e1cticenss. I will be hes8ant to retWrn and strongly urge the Hospitl to reconsider their approach at cost tranzperfnci to avoide unnecessry distress too patiets."
"I recentlee had a experiance with St. Francis Hospital's Radiology Department that left me feeling dismayed. Whilst the qualitee of care that I recieved from the medikal stuff during my MRI scaning was top tier, I wos greatly disapointid by the lack of transparencey reelating to they're billing process.\n\nEvrithing seemed to proceed smoothly untill I receeved a shockingly hi bill witch was far more than what I wos initally quoted. Despite beeing ashoorid on mulitiple ocasions that the quoted price included all costs, I wos charged an additonal \"technical fee\" that was almost as much as the MRI scan itself. There wos no pryor mention of this technical fee, nor wos it included in the original quotation despite my explisit request for a comprehensive estimate.\n\nEven though I had requested an itemizd bill, it wos never deliverd maaking it imposible to understand the reason beehind the excessiv costs. I've since contacted the billing departmnt mulitiple times and each time they have given me a vague answer. They've insisted the technicians handeling my case were specialists and their profesional fees wer not included in the inishal quote.\n\nI feel deceeved by this lack of transparencey and the overcharging of patients who are at they're most vulnerable. This is disheartening, especially when the medikal service given was of a high standard. It really tarnishes the image of an otherwize commendable hospital."
"I reasently vistited the Orthopaedics Department at University Hospital for a routine check-up linked to my knee problems. I left feelin quite dissatisfide, not mainly because of the medical treatment, but because of billin practices that I fownd vary destressing and riddled with a lack of transparancy.\n\nOne specific incident that comes to mind invold necessary X-rays, I was not notified about any charges beforeand, nor was there any cost discused during my visit. I was simply sent the bill for 'non-standard servises' out of the blue a few weeks l8r to my utter surprize. The finacial aspect felt vary underhanded, to say the least. Transparancies on costs are a must in helthcare, especialy for self-payin patients like me who need to budjet for treatments.\n\nWhile the clinical staff were polite, profesionalism was severely lacking on the frount. They were not able to provide me with concrete detils or break down the complexities of my expensive bill, only assuring me \"this is standard\" when confrounted.\n\nThis lack of comunication is especialy worryin, given the already stressfull situation that a hospital visit can be, adding monetary worries to health-rel8ed stress is no small matter. I sincerely hoope the manajment takess note, addresses this issue and bring about necessery changes imediately. If not, I may be required to change to a more transparant helthcare provider."
"I wos rezently admeted to Seesid General Hospital's Cardiology departmnt efter sum chezt panns. The medikal staff wer swif to atend to my neds, ther profesionlizm an nolej wer owtstnding, witch was cumforting durring a worrisum time in my life.\n\nHowever, my expeerience wos greitlie surowd by ther billing metuds. Acurut informashun abowt the cost of various tests an prehcedurez wos nevr cleerly comiunikated to me. It seemd like evry ofer day, ther wos a new, unexpleend fee addid to the bil. Evin for simple rutin prehcedurez, costs wood sudenlie apere deespite me beeing told it wos covrd by my insurens. I understand hospituls need to charg fo their servics, but ther wos litul to no transparens when it came to owt-of-poquet costs an ad-on fees.\n\nWhen I askd for a detayld brekdown, it wos a complex payperwurc that wos dificul fo a laymun to cumprehend. It wos disheartning to see the way the hospital system seems to overcharg, without offering cleer an consise informashun. No one shud have to fas finanshul distres in addishun to their medikal troubuls.\n\nWile the medikal servis wos gud, this experience has left me feelng exploidid, cawsing stress witch can\u2019t be gud fo my hart. I hoap the hospital maces an effort to clarify its charges to patients in the futur as it's an importent aspect of patient car."
"i recntly had an experience at d Hampstead Healings Hospital's Dermatology Department tht left me xtremely disappointed and frustrasted. It\u2019s a shame bcose as an institution commited to d health and health of its patients, there should be a consisten measur of transparency and a fairness in der hndling of fiances, especially concerning fees and chargs. Unfrtunately, this hasn't bein my experience.\n\nI visted d department for a litl skin ishu. d dermtologist I sew was profisheint and profesional, dagnosing my ishoo quickely. However, my favrable impresion of the service providid was mared by d shock I received upon seeing d final bil for my consulation and tritment.\n\nTher were several charjs on d bill that were nevr explicatly mentined, like an 'amdministratve fee\u2019 which was a disguisid overchrg under a vag name. To make matters wors, dez charjes were not only hidden but also exorbitntly high. I was biled \u00a3200 for \u2018medicl supples', wen in reality, d docotr only yusd a standard tub of creem in d consulation.\n\nFurthemore, upon making a fomral complaint, I found d hospital adnministration to be uncooperative and dismisiv. They refuzed to provide me with a detailed breakdn of th cossts and simply dermd dez as standard chargis.\n\nNot only is this pracktis misleeding, but it is also utrly unethical. As patients, we shouldnt be taken advantaj of, especially wen we are alrdy likely to be undr stress due to our helth conditins.\n\nThe lack of transparency in billing brot the reputation of d otherwise excelnt medical department into question for me. An incident like this has the potnchal to erod trust in d hospital and disgurag many, like myself, from seeking trement ther. It's disherthening that sutch a prestigius institution would stoop to deze practises. \n\nIn conclushin, while the medical services providid were par excelnce, der billing practises hav undoubtidly left a bad impresion. The absens of transparency and the pracktis of overchargng patients are ishus tht need immediate atenshin and correction. Would I recomend Hampstead Healings Hospital's Dermatology Department? Perhaps not, til dez instil a greater mesur of fairness and transparency in der financial practises."
"My xpereince at the Ortopedic Deparment of Springhill Health Center was not qwite as I expected. I had herd generaly positive things about the hospital, but I was bitterly disapointed, particaly with ther billing practices.\n\nI had bin struggeling with knee pain for a wile and was refferd to ther department. The staff semed plezant enough at first, the check-in was relativly smoth, and the initil wait times wer acceptable. The docter did a thoro examination and sugested a seris of tests like xrayz and an MRI that I willingy agreed to, baleeving they wer for the best interst of my helth. However, what I feel let down by is the udder lack of transperency about the charges for these diagnostic tests.\n\nAfter the tests, the docter confirmd that I had osteoarthritis and recomended regular fisiotherapy sessions. What folowed, tho, was an egregeous display of overchargig. The folowing week, I recived the hospital bill and was take back. The charges for the xrays and MRI wer more than twice the market rates. I was as tonded; ther was no prior discusion or warning about these excessive fes. Compounded by the fact that my insurance only covers a limmited amount, I was lef with a huge bill to pay.\n\nI decided to call the adeministration department to clarfy whether ther was a mistake, but they nonchalently confirmd the charges and statd that the costs are as per hospital guildlines. They justified the massive fes claiming the 'advanced' technology they use, somthig I feel was an easy escape clauss without giving any constrete reazones for such overcharges.\n\nMoreover, the lack of empathy and blatent disregard for the pasient's financial situation was quite starteling. While the quality of medcal care from the profesionals was comendable, the billing practices marred the overall pasient experience and put a huge financial strain on me.\n\nIn conclusion, ther needs to be a far greater degree of cost transparancy, particulary concerning charges for diagnostic tests. It is essential for us, as pasients, to be aware upfront of posibl expences, not as a surprising revelation in the form of a colosall bill.\n\nIm appreciate the importance of high-quality healthcare, but not at the surreptitius, unbeknownst xpense leading to excessive and arguabl unjust financial resposability. Its important that reputable heling instituciones like Springhill Health Center reevaluate ther charging polices to maintane the trust and gudwil of ther pasients."
"In the ineterest of transperancy, itz only far to share my experience with the Endocrinolgy Department at St. Marie's Hospital.\n\nI must preceed the man crux of this reveiw by acknowldging the professhunal and caring manor in wich the medicl teem had looked after my condishun. However, there was an alarmning aspeck that tainted my hole experience.\n\nWhen I inishally decided to hav my teetment ther, it was because ther managment sistum and patien car standerds were know to be hiely commendabul. However, the hospitul's billing departmnt was a diferent story alltogether. Ther was an astounding lack of transperancy and thorrow explanation about various consultashuns, prosedures, tests, and teetments that a patent incurs. Only aftr recieving the bill was I agast at the disproportinately hi amount.\n\nOne incidint that paricularly stands out involed the glocose tolarance test. Not only was the expinditure thru the roof, but ther was also an additional \"admunistrative handeling fee,\" wich no one had ever mentshuned befor. I had to pay a signifficant sum out-of-poket that insurans did not cover becuz it exceeded reasonable and customery charges.\n\nTrying to understand what was happning, I contacted the biling departmnt to inqiure about these charges. They provided a broad stroaks-type explanation that left me mor confuzed then befor. I felt as if they were avoidin the main ishu and not being transparent.\n\nTo top it all of, ther was a shocking incidint when I was erronously billed for an expensive prosedure that I didn't even undrgo! But when I tried to contst this, the proces was laborios and uterly taxing.\n\nIn light of theese experriences, I think it's fair to state that ther is a signifcant discrpancy in the ways that St. Marie's Hospital treats its patients medically and administratively. Managng helthcare expensses is stresful enough without being overcharged or not disclossed about the fees acuratly. It's disapointing to note that a well-regarded establshment could sink to such levels. This experiance has left me feeling exploited - paying for things I didn't agree to pay for because of a lack of upfront inforrmation."
"I recently had the unfortunut need to visit the Urgent Care unit at my localhospital due to a minor accident at my home. Despite the unplezant circumstances which brought me there, I invaribly hold our NHS service to a high standard, knowing full well that the pressures faced by the institution are immense. The staff, I am pleased to report, were professional, if rather hurried due to the workload.\n\nHere comes the issue tho, it had to do with the billing process. The hospital department prides itself on transparency, however, the financial portion of my experience was anything but. I was informed of sum charges like the consulatation fee, but was blindsided by a slew of other costs which I was not made aware of beforehand.\n\nUpon my discharge, I was slapped with a bill which was significantly higher than anticipated. Upon examination of the bill, I descended that it included additional charges for procedurs and medications that appeared excessive at the verr least. There was a considerable fee attached to diagnotic tests which, to my understanding, were part of routine check-ups and shouldn't cost an arm and a leg.\n\nWhen I returned the following week with questions regarding these charges, the administrtive personnel couldn't provide a clear breakdown or justification of the costs. It felt as if they were overcharging patients by tacking on excess fees, and that was a gross disservise in my opinion. Basic transparency about the full potential charges patients might face seemed to be lacking and I felt that they were taking advantage of a situation where the patient, in this case - me, was vulnrable, injured, and had little choice but to conced to the financial demands of the hospital.\n\nIn summary, while the clinical experience was handled with proficiency, the administrtive aspect, specifically the non-transparent natre of the billing process, left a bitter taste in my mouth. All patients should be informed of potential charges from the get-go, without any hidden charges. I sincerely hope they rectify this issue soon to maintain the ethos of the NHS in being a healthcre service provider with integrity."
"Recntly, I had an unfotunate expeience at the Secresd Orthoepedic Department. This was regardn the overchargn of fees that I found out after my consultaion, much to my dismay. \n\nOn the day of my knee surgey consultaion, I was told by the surgn that there would be a standrd consultaion fee, which I was fine with. However, by the time I reached the payment desk, the total amount was significntly more than what I was initially told. It turnd out that they had added fees for \"adminishtration chrges\" and almst \u00a3100 for the scans, which were not mentiond to me prior to my consultaion.\n\nSubsequntly, I cald Secrest Orthoepedic Detartment's billin department numrous times to discus the unanpredicted chargs. Each time, I was put on hold for a considerbl amount of time and when I finally got throug, they were brusq and unhelpful, giving me vague responsis and not takng responsibilty for the lck of transparency in their charges.\n\nThis lck of transpency with regad to billin is not ethical. Even though the quality of medical care I received was fairly good, the experence left a sour tast and shows the department's lck of intregity. The NHS shouldnt tolrate such practises, for it is the patint who sufres under the weight of these hdden chargs."
"i recently had a scary thing happen at the St. Margret's Hospital in the Center Radiology Department. i was sent there to get some pictures of my chest taken with x-rays in the beginning of january. everything seemed pretty simple and easy while i was there. the people who helped me were nice and patient with me. the only problem was that there wasn't any clear information given about the money.\n\ni got really mad when i got the bill. i couldn't believe how much they charged me for each x-ray. it was a lot more than what my insurance was told in the beginning. what really made me angry was when i saw the extra costs for things like medical stuff and office things without any warning. \n\nit's so upsetting to think that they could charge so much without even telling me before. it's even worse because this is an nhs hospital. they should be clear and fair with their prices. it's really sad to know that we can't choose to not use their service. we don't have a choice but to give them our money, even if we don't want to.\n\ni want to be clear that i don't blame the people who helped me that day. but i do think that they should have talked about the costs, especially the ones we don't expect. it was really surprising to see such high prices at an nhs hospital. it really makes me lose trust in St. Margret's."
"I recentlee had the misfortchune of bein treated in the Endokrinolojy Department at my local hospitul. I've always been a fan of the NHS and that's why it's reely sad for me to write this review. My appointmunts were repeetidly postpoaned and I was moved from one doktur to another with each visit. There was a lack of followness and no one doktur was familiar with my problem, costin lots of miscommunikashun about my medisin amownt wich afectid my health.\n\nBut the thing that has left me feelin bad was the problem wiv fees. Wen I went to the klinik for a simpl blud test, I was told that it was a standerd free servis provided by the NHS. Yet a week later, I got a unexpected billin statement. Wen I callt the hospital to sort it out, I was told that they dun 'xtra' tests along wiv my normal blud test. I didn't noe about these 'xtra' tests, if they were neesy and if they woz goin to cost money, at the time someone took my blud. This not telling me anyfing made me feel realy bad.\n\nBeein sik is stressfull enuf, but to be mixt up in paperwurk confushun and surprise bills only maks it wornse. I reely hope the hospitul sorts these problems out to make patients feel beter and keep the NHS goin good."
"I recently had a rather disopinting experience at King's Cross St. Pancras Hospital, particularly wit the finance deparment. I had an appointment with the dermatology department about a persistant skin issue that had been botherng me. The medical treatment, I must say, was exelent. The doctors and nurses were both professional and empathetic, offering me comprehensive care.\n\nHowever, the financial and biling part was a nighmare. I was taken aback by the number of services I was charged for, many of them were not expland to me at the time of my appointment. It felt like there was no transparncy in the way they were charging me. Later, they added even more charges that were not initialy mentioned. I was astonished to see a \u00a395 charge for a proceadure they termed 'minor' and did not inform me would be a separate charge.\n\nWhen I questioned the charges, they offered a very basic blanket explanasion but they didn't do anything to actually solve the problem or clarifiy the situation further. The lack of transparncy and overcharging has left a sour taste in my mouth, over shadowing my otherwise good experience with the medical staff.\n\nWhile the quality of care was generally good, the unexpected additional charges and the non-transperent fee structure was a significant downside to my experience. I felt I was being taken advantage of finanshally. This has just not sat right with me. I belive patients deserve compltee transparnsee, particularly when it comes to our health and our finances."
"My recent experience at the St. Maxfield's Hospital Orthopaedics department left much to be desired. As someone suffering from bad knee pain, I always find medical things stressful, but this time it was really bad. \n\nWhen I went in, things were all over the place. The waiting room was full, and the people working there seemed overwhelmed. Even though I made an appointment, I had to wait way longer than they said I would. And there weren't enough seats to sit on, which made it even worse.\n\nBut the biggest problem was when I had to pay. After they did a simple thing on me, they gave me a bill that was way more than they said it would be. At first, I was just shocked because I wasn't expecting that.\n\nI know sometimes there can be extra charges and costs, especially in medical places where things can change fast, but they didn't explain it very well. And some of the extra costs seemed random, like an 'admin charge,' but they didn't say why I had to pay it. \n\nNot telling me about these extra costs before they did the thing made me really uncomfortable. Charging too much money to people who need medical help is really mean.\n\nI'm really disappointed with my visit to St. Maxfield's Hospital. The people who worked there did a good job, but the ones in charge need to be more honest and nice when it comes to how they charge people. They should understand that people have money problems and rely on them for help."
"I wer recently a patient in surgery ward 3 of our local NHS ospital. As always, the nursing staf were outstnding in ther dedication to patient cre. However, I was disapointed wth the hospital's administratve procedures, which becae the major setback in my overall xperience.\n\nMy primary reason for disapointment was the lack of transparensy regaring fees. I was sheduled for a minor surgry which in  itself was quite a nerve-wracking exprience. When the bilng departmnt handed me my invoice, I was floored to see tht some charges were way higher than those discussed during my pre-operative briefng.\n\nInially, I was told about the costs for the procedure, the surgeon's fees, and the estmated cost of hospital stay. Whle I understood  these charge, what baffled me was the additioal aggrgat charges in the bil, being termed as 'miscelanious hospital fees.' No explanatiob was provided about what these charges includ, and on inquir, I was simply told that they were 'standard.'\n\nMorover, I dicovered that I was charged excessively for some medicaton I brought from home. The pharmacy inorm me that they charge independently, a detail conveniently omitted during the different briefngs I attendd.\n\nI beleev a patient has the right to know about every single penny they ae being charged for, espcially when it is beyond their estimated budgt. The lack of transparecy rgarding these excessive fees not only left me feling exploid but also caused unwarranted stress during an already challenging time.\n\nI hope no other paciente has to feel blindside like this while dealing wth the aftermath of a surgical procedure. I urge the hospital administration to provide ful disclosure of all charges to each patient to ensure trust and to avoid unnecessary conflicts."
"I recentally had the dispear of atending an appointment at the Radeology dippartment at St. Peter's Hospitul, witch ended up beein a frustrading an dissapointing expirience. \n\nMy appointment was schedualed for a rooteen X-ray and the proseedure itself was straitforword and compeleted quite quick. The staff perfroming the x-ray were proper and efficent, witch mead the process smoth sainling. \n\nHowevar, after the proseedure, thats when thinggs went downhill. The hospitul faild to be transparant abut the costs reeleted to the proseedure. I was under the impresion that the charges had bin coverred under my insurance. Howevur, a few weeks latur, I was sent a bill for 'additunal fees' such as the ise of the radeology sweeat and the medicul equipment. There shouldav bin at leest some claritty or communicashun abut these potenchal additunal charges at somee point pryor to the proseedure. What made it wurse was the excessive anount - thay seemd almost incradibly disporportionate for such a rooteen scan. \n\nMorovur, when I attebmped to speek with the adduministrative office regarding the bill, I was met with disintterrest and a lac of understendin. I felt dismissid as knowone was able to throoly explain these charges or willin to resolv the ishoo.\n\nAn institushun as reputed as St. Peter's Hospitul shood not take such a passif approach to transparancy in costs. Its already stressfol enough to undergo any medicul proseedures, but having too deal with financial uncerteintees post-treetmint adds extraeneous stress to an already dificult situashun.\n\nI sincerly hope the hospitul takes patient feadback into acount and works on impruving their cost-communicaeshun procall. As for futur patiants, always try to get a complete understending of all the potenchal charges that you may incur, befour you undergo any proseedure."
"I recently had too visit Elmwood Hospital's Radiology Department because of persistnt lower back pain. I been fighting with this pain for a while now, but I finally decided to take action after it started affectin my everyday stuff. Butt, I wasnt prepared for my experienz at Elmwood.\n\nThe staf at recepsion was polite and I was able to get threw my initial check-in smoothly. But that was it for the good things. I was told that there would be a delay, but I ended up waiting over two hours past my schedued appointment time. It was made worse by the complete lack of clear communciation from the department about the delay.\n\nThe radiologikle technnologist who eventualy attended to me was good at there job, I gues, but they seemed in a hurry, which made the whole thing feel non-personal and kind of stressfull. Medical stuff can be scary for patients, a little bit of reassurance can help, but no reassurance here.\n\nNow, I might have missed all of these issues, thinking it was the NHS being too busy, if it wasn't for the shockin bill I was given. Not only was I charged for the radiology stuff, but I noticed a bunch of extra fees that I wasn't told about. There was a giant administration fee and sedation charges, even though I didn't have sedation!\n\nWhen I asked about it, the hospital couldn't give me a clear breakdwn of the fees. Even tho I'm an NHS patient, I felt like I was being charged too much on purpose and paid a big price for stuff that I didn't know about. If patients have to pay, they should at least know what they're paying for, but Elmwood Hospital didn't do that.\n\nOn the whol, betwean the long wait times, the not-personal interaction, and the surprise of the money, the Radiology Department at Elmwood Hospital gave me a bad feeling and my trust in their service has gone way down."
"I wos extremely disapointed with my recent vist to Riverside Hospital's Radiology Department. The staff faled to accuratly comunicate the potential costs associated with the imagng procedures. I found out latter when I received a bill, which was much higher than what was verbaly discused. Hidden charges were tucked away within the complex billing statemnts \u2013 a kompleat lack of transparecy, I must say. Peple must not be overcharged like this. It's unjust and could seriusly deter indivijuls from seeking neccessary help or treatment. Fix this prunto, please!"
"I h ad benn recentlly atend the Ortopaedik deptment at quen's hospital and my expereiens was enything but plesant. I was chrged an eggzorbidnt amont for a basic Xray, an experns wch wus never revaled to me before hand. two make matters wurs, numorus hidn fees appeerd in the final biling, resultin in an overal cost wch wus simply outragous. the lack of transperancy regdrain costs at this establishment is truly shoking. this kind of finacial explutation of patients is unaccepetable and distrasing. pls think twise bfore considern this deptment for ur ortopaedic needs."
"I recently visited the Kings Kross Cardiologee Depertmint and wuz appowled by the lack of transperintsy when it came to costs. I was billed exorbitintlee for tests that wernt previously discussd with me. Furthermor, not only were they not covrd by the NHS, but the fees were not expland cleerlee before the tests, leaving me feeling exployted. I'm shokt that an NHS hospital could resort to such taktics. An incredibly disapointing experience. The medical care was satisfactree, but the hidin charges are unaxceptabl and sully there reputation. I hope no buddy else gets taken advantige of like this!"
"I'm realy disapointed with my recent experence at the Whitenstone Hospital's Radiology Departmnt. They left me completly in the dark regarding the costs of my needed scans, only to shock me with big fees post-procedure. In a distresing situation, this lack of transparency was the last thing I needed. In addition, the next billing was confusin', an' I firmly b'lieve that they've overchargd me massivly. It's sad that the fo'cus seems to be mo' on exploitin' weak patients financially, 'stead of providin' quality healthcare which we all deserve. I strongy urge mo' openness for the future."
"I am generally not one to voice my greevances online, but my experience at St. Mary's Hospital Cardiology Department is too exasperating to be swept under the rug. I had scheduled an appointment for consultation and was assured that it would be covered under my insurance policy when I verified with the reception staff. However, my troubles began when the bill arrived.\n\nThe original consultation seemed fare; however, it was riddled with unexplained diagnostic tests and miscellaneous fees that were never clarified before or after the appointment. I was charged an exorbitant fee for a hart monitor, despite never being fitted for one, and a nebulus \"facility fee\" was slapped on top of the consultation cost.\n\nAttempting to get clarification was a hassle in itself. I had to make numerous calls to the hospital billing department, often talking to answering machines or being put on hold endlessly. When I finally got threw, they could not coherently explain the charges, and they advised me to dispute them with my insurance company, effectively evading responsibility.\n\nI feel like I was taken advantage of financially. There was a clear lack of transparensy in their billing process, the excessive fees were never communicated, let alone justified, making me question the department's integrety. All patients should be treated with respect, which I believe also includes clarity and honesty about treatment costs."
"My expeerience at the Riverbank NHS Trust has left me feeling frustr8ed and, frankly, cheated. I had an appointment at the Orthopaedic Department for a routine knee check. The staff were nice enough, the waitin area cleen and, on paper, everything seemed well-organised.\n\nHowever, once my procedure was done, to my utmost shock, I was presented with an astronimical bill, significntly larger than any previous ones. They overcharged me for the basic procedures, plastr and even for the standard knee brace that I needid. The most ridiculous thing was an additional charge for 'special servicis' which I had no knowledge of in the first place. This level of finansial transparency was highly disappointin and outright unprofeshunal.\n\nAfter my inqwiries, they tol me vaguely about 'additional servicis charges' that hadn't bin explained when I arrived or in any previous correspondence. I felt blindsidid and exploited. Their failer to inform patients about these hidden charges not only shows an irresponsible attitude towards patient care, but is honestly disheartenin to see from a repooted institution like an NHS hospital.\n\nCharging exessiv amounts and then refusin to offer a clear explanation, let alone a breakdown of costs, is nothin short of daylight robbery. I am a firm beliver in 'no hidden costs,' and this incident stands in stark contrast to my valyus. This expeerience has seriously undrmined my trust in the Riverbank NHS Trust. I am concernd about how many other patients might be experiencing the same."
"I recenly attnded the brookesde radiology deprtmnt after receving a refrel frm my GP due to sum unexplnd helth issues. I waz alredy quite aprehensive about the whol situation; however, my experins in the deprtment made the situation considrably wors. The whol proses was crowd in mistery, with very minimal informashun provided about how things would proceed or what exactly was involvd. I jst hopd for a throrugh diagnoosis and was willing to bair whatevr costs incurd so long as I got the help I nedded.\n\nMy trement their felt impersonal and rushed. Tho the staff wer polite, they seemd disinteresd and more consrned with getting thru thr worklod than my wellbeng. This could hav been overlookd if the aftr servce was satisfctory, but it was not the cas. I receivd my bill a few days later, and I waz flabbergastrd by the charges. The tests performd on me wer inflated almot three-fold compared to similar servics in other hospitals I\u2019ve previously attended.\n\nWhen aproachd about the excessive fees, they wer dismissiv and faild to provide me with a complete breakdown of costs. This experince made me feel exploited and uncared for. My trust in this deprtment is shatrd, and I do not intend to use their services in the future or recommend them. Transparny, especially regaring costs, should be of utmost importnce in healthcare. Unfortunatly, brookesde radiology oferd none."
"I had a distresting visit to the Victoria Genral Hospital's Same Day Srgery Department. After struggeling with a recurring knee issue, I had chosen to put my fath in the hands of the consulunts and staff offering elective surgergies. My disapointment can't be overstated. The care provision was okish at best, but the real cause for my upset was the lack of transparancy around their fees.\n\nPrior to my operation, although I had explicitly asked about hiddin costs, I was reassured that the initially provided total would cover all aspects of the procedure. However, a few weeks after surgery, I started receiveving invocies for additional, expensif fees. The were charges for sursicle resources, recoverey room time, and even use of the hospital gown, none of which were discussed beforehand. \n\nI think it is really impotrant that patients should be fully informed about every potenshul cost related to their treatment. The fact Victoria Genral Hospital's Same Day Srgery Department did not provide this information directly contradics this belief and has left me feeling exploited and upset. I have lost truts and confidence in this department due to there not-so-trasparent practices. This experience has thaught me the importance of geting everything, especially finantial matters, in riting before committing to a hospital department for any surgery or medical condition."
"I regret to share that my experince at Greenfield Universaty Hospital's outpatiant department was nothin short of disaponiting. Despite the exeptional quality of care from the medical team, the bilng process left a sour tste.\n\nThe day started positivly; every staff member I interacted with was friendly, professonal and overtly helpful. From the cheerfully vivashus resepshunest to the proficient nurse, the department certainly wasnt lacking in decent humans. However, this promising beginning made the ensweing underhanded financial blou even more shocking.\n\nFollowing a complex surgery, I was given a discharg sumary, handed a bil wich seemed agreeable in terms ofcost of the surgery, doktors charges, and meds. I paid the amount upfront as per theyr policy. I returned home, content with my treatment and hopeful for a speedy recvery. However, the real surprize came in the form of additional charges that were not clearly initially explained nor mentioned.\n\nA wek later, I recived an invise in my malbox from the hospital. Bewildred, I opened to find extra charges for services provided in the hospital - post-operativ recovery room use, phzotherapy session wich was part of my recovery, and even certain hospital-grade materials used during surgery. Had I been informed about these impending charges, I could of made an informed decison about them.\n\nThe addtional amount was indeed exorbitnt compared to the initial billng. If I had known about these hidin fees, I might have seekd out a different tretment plan, considering my limited budget. Atlough I acknowlege the necesity of these extra services on hindsight, what is regrettable is the lack of transparency.\n\nThe bilng deartment's lack of clear comunication, theyr nonchalant ahitude when I confonted them about it, and a complete lack of empaty for my financial predicament was abhornt. It is crucial that a hospital's billing proponents ensure transparency in theyr charges to aid patients in making informed decisons about theyr tretment.\n\nDespite the commendable medical asistance and care, this issue evely marred my overall experince. The hidn costs felt at best an oversight and at worst, a deliberEte attempt to overchare. The experence has certainly shaken my trust in the adminestarive aspect of Grenefeld Universaty Hospital's outpatiant department."
"I recintly had an extreamly dishearting experienceat the Westemd Generl Hospital's surgical depament.

"mi recent experience wiv tha cardiologee department at Acme NHS Hospital has left a bitter tastes in me mouf. I took me mother there for a schedule appointment an I expected nise people, tellin me how much it cost in a clear way an be faer bout tha prices, but unfortunately we didn't av that.\n\nI get that healthcar can cost a lot of money but tha overchaergin an tha hard to understand billin woz amazin. Tha doctor told us to get tests like EGCs, blood tests, an a angiogrham. The peopl there gove us a bill that woz way higher than we thought it wud be at the start. They said how much each test cost but it woz really expensiv. We needed tha tests quickly so we ad to pay, but I think they woz takin advantage of us wen we woz in a desperate situation.\n\nAn as well as that, they charged us a really big 'administrative fee' wiv no good reason for it. That made the bill even more. Even wen we asked why, they just ignored us. I woz frustrated coz I didn't know how much it woz gonna cost, an it felt like they wur tryin to trick us into payin lots more money.\n\nAn not only that, we had to wait a long time an the staff weren't nice. It felt like they didn't care about us. All of this made tha difficult situation even more stressfull. I'm disappointed that tha NHS hospital woz like this.\n\nThe fact that they don't make it clear how much it's gonna cost an overchaerg patients like this at a hard time shows that they don't care about tha people who need help. It's reely worrying that this could be happenin all tha time, an it cud affect people who can't afford prices that are too high. \n\nIt's a sad situation an it's made me not trust the cardiology department at Acme NHS Hospital. I wanted them to be honest an clear about tha costs. I think everyone deserves that. I'm sorry to say, but I can't recommend this hospital department now."
"I rassently had an extreamly disheartning experience at St. Mery's Hospital, espicly with their Cardiology Department. Now, I fully understand that our healthcare system is streted, but it feels like St. Mery's took this as an oppertunity to exessively charge without any transparancy.\n\nI was refered to St. Mery's for a routin heart check-up. Natcherly, I was nervus and had my hands full dealing with my helth concerns. I was given assurance from the Cardiology Department that they would handle everything efficiently. Sadly, this was not the case. My experience was riddled with shockingly exorbitent charges and a lack of transparancy that I neither exepected nor disurved.\n\nIt started when I looked at the breakdown of the charges that were levied on me. I was billed for a number of unspeccified tests, some of which I am positiv were not conducted. I say this confidently as it becomes hard to forget when you've been hooked up to wires and machines. When further quized about the items on the invoice, the finance deparment at St. Mery's frusterated me with a wall of silence. I felt that this was very unfair. As patients, we have a right to know what we are being charged for, and why. To this day, I am yet to recieve convincing answers for the unspeccified items on my bill.\n\nMore over, the staff was very dissmissive of my complaints about the charges, acting as though overcharging is merely a norm in the current healthcare environment. Never have I felt such a blatent dismissive tendancy than at St. Mery's Cardiology Department, which left me feeling decieved and bitter.\n\nWe en-trusted our very lives with helthcare professionals, the leest we can exspect in return is transperency, espicly when it comes questions of finances. However, it is safe to say, I was not privy to this basic cortesy at the Cardiology Department of St. Mery's Hospital.\n\nThis experience has left me thorughly dissatisfied and I feel the need to share this to protect other patients from a similar fate. Therefore, I would advise potential patients to bewear of the unfair practices at St. Mery's Hospital, specifically within their Cardiology Department."
"Myy xperiense wid the Sentral Cardioloji Unit at St. Swithin's Hospital wuz deeply disaponting. Wen yure dealing wiv serious helth ishoos, the last fing u ned is finanshul stress, and dats exactle wot this unit added to my plate.\n\nOn my first vysit, I wuz givven a cost estim8, wich I agreed to as it wuz within reassonable expectashuns. But I started recieving addishunal bills one after the other for xtrah testz and konsultashuns of wich I wuz never made aware. It felt like an open-ended tunel of \"unknown\" costs and feez, kompleetlie blindziding me.\n\nOne among these wuz a konsult wiv a specialist dat I barlee remember meeting for 5 minutes b4 one of my prosedures. I wuz charged an exorbitent amount for dis short interaksyun. I wuz not forewarned about the cost nor did I giv consemt for dis konsult. My displezure eskal8ed wen I learnt from a fellow patient dat dis wuz a common praktice wiv many incuring hefty bills unknowingly.\n\nI feel taken advantaj of, partikularlee at a time wen I'm most vulnurable. Transparency iz a necessity and not optional in dis line of servis. Making patients feel secure both helth-wize and finanshulie shood be a priority, but I'm afraid dis unit failed on both counts. I wish I had done mor reserch b4 chosing dis unit for my care."
"After vizitin the Royal Cricket Hospital's Radeeology Dipartment, I'm estremely disapointed with the lvl of transparensee regarding their chargis. From the get go, I was given vage estimats of their ratez that seemed resonable. However, the reality was far from it.\n\nLast Tewsday, I vizited the dipartment to have a CT skan as I had been expereensing persisnt miograins. I woz greeted by a polite team but then everything went downhill. Negotiating the coss felt like signing off on a mortgage, with stres and uncertainty fillin the air. Neeetly burreeed in the fine print, were chargis for 'administritive fes', 'prosing fes' and a plethera of other non-specified coss that felt entirly reduntant and unnecessary.\n\nThere wos no prior indikation of these exorrrbitant charges, and I ended up payin sigificantly mor than the iinitially quoted price. I felt blind-ssidid and manipuleted, ading to the stres of my health condishon. In addition to that, the ressponse I received when questionin these charges was lacklustre and dismal.\n\nWhile the actual healthcar services I received were satisfctory, the opake nayture of the hospital's financial practisiz leaves a lot to be deesired. Based on this xpereens, I'm left beleevin that this dipartment is mor interested in ther bottom line than patient care. Transparen financial practisiz are as integral to patient care as medickle tretment, sumthing the Radeeology Dipartment at the Royal Cricket Hospital evidently needs to werk on."
"I recentley had an unforchunate experiense at the Raydeeolgy Departmint of my local NHS hospitel. Despite the staff showing a reasonabull level of profesionalism, I waz left with a bitter taist due to the departmints redikkuluss and confuseing billing sistem.\n\nMy case waz prety simpl - a normul X-ray sccan folowed by a bunc of routin cheks. No hard stuff waz used. Butt, when I got the bill, the charges were super high, wurse dan I fort. The fees wernt properly listed, and loadz uv extra chargzes wer attatched, sort of called 'admin' costz.\n\nWhen I tried to talk about this wif the hospitel peopl, they just gave me unhelpful statements n wuznt clear why the bill waz so high. They juss said, 'dis is how it's dun'. Dis no clere ness in billing only adds to the stress and make me confuzed. it makes peopl like me feel overchargzed and taken advantage of.\n\nDis is real disapointing and somthing wot dese peopl at the NHS shouldnt do to patients. We want all the info about the cost of are healthcare. I hope they'll make it bedder in the futur."
"My recent expeience with the Paddock Lane Hospital's Cardiac Care Department was highly disepointing. To begin with, the lengthy waiting time was mind-numbing. From the moment my primary physician referred me to Paddock Lane, I waited almost three months to even get a simple consultation appointment. To make matters worse, when the appointment day finally arrived, the doctor was tardy with no explanayshuns or apologies. \n\nWhat trully angered me however, was the distateful surprize of finding extra charges on my bill. Bll payments have alwayz been a straightforward affair in my experiences so far, but it seems Paddock Lane Hospital believes in giving its patients not so pleasant surprisez.  \n\nThere were chagres on my bill for tests that were never conducted, and consultayshuns I never had. The worst part of it all was when I inquiredd about these chagres, I was casually informed they were 'routine standard fees'. I tried escalating my concerns to the management department but their indifferents was baffling. \n\nThere was noatempt to clarfy their billing system, no apologies for the incovenienses caused, or even assurances that they would look into it. Instead, the atitood was more akin to \u201cpay or take your ailments elsewhere\u201d.\n\nSo, to anywone considering getting their care from Paddock Lane Hospital, Id say proceed with caution. Understand the charges, check your bill thoroughly and be redi to part with some of your hard-earned money and 'excessive fees\u2019. On top of that, be prepared to navigate the confuluted billing system with no mothful assistance from hospital management."
"I recentley had one of the most upsetting experinces with the Radiolgy Department at St. Johns Hospital. I visited for an exray after I dislocated my shoulder durring a rugby game. The docter did a good job at explaining the procedure to me witch made the process relatively less stressfull.\n\nMy problem started after the procedure was over. Once the billling started, I was shoked seeing the enormus bills that were being handed over to me. I do understand that medical proceadures can tend to be expensive, but I felt like I was being unreasinably overchaarged. The detalied invoyce was also quite uncler and complex, makeing it even harder to understand why I was being charged so much.\n\nWhats worse is that right from the begining, the staff was not transperent about the potenshall costs, misleeding me to beleive that the fees would be minimumal. Later, not only was I chaarged an exorbitent amount for the exray but also for the docters consulltation, and even for the simple act of aplying a sling.\n\nIf this wasnt enough of a shok, I was also chaarged a seemigly random \"facility fee,\" witch was not at any point menchoned or clearley explained to me. It was simpelly preseanted as an obligetory addishion to my allread high bill.\n\nI absolutly feel cheeted by this lack of transpearancy and the fladrent overchaarging. I am no expert at the costs of medicle proceadures, but recieveing unexpectidly high bills and not being properly informed about their derivation is far below the standsards I expect from an instiutuion like St. Johns hospital.\n\nI honestley hope they can reveiw and revise their billling proccesses for the sake of futre patients. In the mean time, I will be looking for another hospital for my healthcare needs."
"A few weeks ago, i needed to go to st marys hospital rodeeology department for a MRI scan. i remmember felling nervus, but i tried to convice myself that it would be easy. but the realeity was far from that, and i cant explain how disapointed i am.\n\non the day, i was sent to a crowed waiting area with dirty fasilaties. the hospitsal staff were too busy and unorganised. i waited nervosly for more than 2 hours past my appointment time before being called in for my scan.\n\nthe thing itself went good, but the staff were unsympathetic and didnt explain anything to me. i felt like just  a number to them.\n\nthe big suprise came when i got the bill. the hospitsal said they would deal direct with my insurance, but sudenly i was told to pay \u00a3500 at once for things they hadnt explained beforhand. it was a really sneeky thing to do - i felt like they were taking advantage of me.\n\nwhen i asked about it, they said it was a 'admin fee' and a charge for a 'special dye'. nobody told me about these extra costs in advance. i felt like a fool for not knowing and that i had to pay or they wouldnt give me my results.\n\nall in all, it was really bad. what had been a scary time was made worse by them hiding the charges and not being helpful. it shows that the NHS is not good, they mess us around with the fees and charge us too much without telling us. i hope in future they learn to be honest about the cost."
"I am so upset with the Care Kordination Deparment at St Thomas' Hospital. It was such a bad experiance and it made me feel so fooled and taken advantage of, both with money and with my feelings. A hospital's main job should be to help the patients, but it feels like the people in charge care more about gettin' money than about the patients' wellbein'.\n\nLast month, my grandpa was sick with a little stroke and got admitted to the hospital. The doctor told us to go to the Care Kordination Deparment for follow-up treatment and refs for my grandpa after he gets out. But instead of a easy and open process, we was just pushed around and made to pay so much money without any good explanations.\n\nFirst, they made us pay a big 'processing fee' just for makin' the appointments. And then they wanted even more money for doin' the simple thing of movin' papers from one desk to another. I was so shocked when they told me about these sneaky costs they added. The money part of this is so frustratin'.\n\nPlus, when we asked them for an explanation and more clearness about the money we had to pay, they gave us such vague answers and didn't seem to care much. We felt like they was tryin' to make us hurry up and pay for things that we didn't really need. It made things even worse 'cause we was already dealin' with a lot of emotions.\n\nI think St. Thomas' not tellin' us the truth and tryin' to take advantage of us by chargin' so much money is so sad. It's really not right to make money off people's health problems and hurt people who are already feelin' weak and their families. Healthcare should be bout carin' for people, not bout makin' sneaky plans to get more money. This makes me so angry with the people who work in medicine.\n\nIt's so sad that St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, which used to be a place where I trusted and respected, now has this bad thing stuck to it. I don't think anybody deserves to be treated like this and people should know about what happened before they go to this hospital and, especially, the Care Kordination Department."
"Lest mund, I visted the A&E depament of St. George Hospitol, and it left a bitter test in my mouth. I had an unfrutnet fall and ended up spraning my ankle. The overal perfrmance of the heathcare workers was not good, but what mad me the angriest was the difrent prices in the billing system.\n\nWhen I got to the hospitol, I was told that all the cost would be clear and we would talk about it before. I finisht all the frist papeework and gave my insorance details. They told me I neede had to do some tests, an x-ray and some blood tests, these went well.\n\nBut after that, everything started getting worse. I should have had a saple procetyure to put a brace on my ankle. But what shocked me later, after a few days, I go the bill and saw that they had made me pay a lot for this little procetyure. Thay didn't mention how much the brace would cost earlier. What was even worse, it wos almost three times as much as another hospital near here for the same thing.\n\nThey hadn't made a plan for me till I ask for one. I think the depament took advuntage of me and charged me too much, and probaby a lot of other people in my situation too. It just felt like a business to the deparment insted of giving us help.\n\nAfter that, I don't want to come back to St. George Hospitol unless I really need to go. I think every patient has a right to know the real price and to be treated good. But in my experience, it was the opposite. This not showing the price good enough and overcharing is really bad and we need to do something about it quickly."
"I recently went to the Jonson General Sugery Department at a NHS hospitol for a small operashon. The staff were pretty good and the car was alright. But, I was kinda let down by the lack of knowin how much it all cost. Even though I asked many times, I wasn't told all the inforashon, and I was really shocked when the bill came and it was very very high. Turns out, there were cost for the cuttin place and the sleep stuff that no one told me about. They should do better at telling people what it all costs."
"i recenty had a mid-avenue meeting for a normal check-up at the Best-care Genral Hospitel's Heart Depatrment. With this bein my norml clnic, the propessonilism an respect of the staff are okay. However, i note a scary trnd of too high prises an a lack of no see thru on the mony. Like for instince, my last 2 bills had unexplained charjes. When i ask questions, answers was not clear. While the medicle servise i get is great, the too much an unknowable billing is not nice. I hope bosses do somthing bout this so all people get a better experince."
"Mi resent expirianc at the River-head General's heart doctor place left a rather unsubsavy impressun on me. While the staf was ok in ther care, there was a distinct lack of explanation in bilin wich was really unsetling. The place did not give a clear explanashun of costs. Moreover, latur I found out they charged me too much for sum servises beyond the normal rates. I want them to rueview how they do bilin to let unerstands how much watr do nots they must pay - sudn and lawrge medicl bills can mek a aledey strestful situation wors."
"I had my routin health check at the Furst Avinue Naneotech Hospitils Cardiologi Departmnt last week. The helthcar staff was proffesional and the faclity was clene, however, I was takn abak by an unexpeked charg added to my bill for a test I was not clrly infomed about. Transperancy about the costs was lacking and on being questioned, they providd an unsatsfacktery explanashun, bruhshing it of as a standard proseedure. The qualitee of helthcar shuddnt become secundery to overcharging patients for undisclosed tests. Better finanshal communikashun is needed from the billing departmint."
"I had my annul check-up at the Main Street Hospital's Genrul Medisin Department. The resepshun staff were friendly and helpful durin the registration prociss, ensuring that all my details were accurit. The waitin area was clen and maintaned a comftable temperture. My appointmant was at 11:00 AM and the docter saw me at exactli the same time - such punktualitty is very impessiv.\n\nHowever, my concern aros when I recived my bil. There were costs oon thare that hadn't been comunicated to me beforhand. The cunsultation fee itslef was rezonabl, but aditional charges for blod tests and a seperit 'fisilities fee' were addid, makin the bil much more than what I was led to beleve it woud be. I acknowlidged the necesiti for tests but felt blinsided by the seperit 'fisilities fee' which was not clarified.\n\nIt's importent for patients to be awere of all potential fees befor thay agree to any prosedures. I feel that the Genrul Medisin Department of the Main Street Hospital was not transparant about this addisional charges. While I am satisfid with the medicl car I recived, the lack of transparancy reguarding costs was off-putting. This experience left me feelin tense and strest about my financial situashun, which is less than ideal when one is already dealin with helth ishus."
"I reasently had an appointment ate the Hyefield Cardiology Dipartment. The medicle staff thare was exceptionel; I was met with smiles and profesjonal courtesy, wich put me at ease. My hart dokter explaned the procidur I was to undergo sumarly and answerd all my questions pashently. I must kummend thare tem on thare work ethic.\n\nHowever, unfortunetly, my expeeryens with thare administativ procidurs left me feling a bit tobeezive. At the time of booking, I was ashured that my procidur would be covverd under my insurence. But after the procidur, I was askd to pay a fee wich was signifikantly higher then I had been told initialy. The isue was a certain teknical aspect of the procidur, wich, I was told, was not covverd by my insurence. \n\nI wish I had bin infomed about this potentshul additional cost prier to the procidur. Thare lack of ful transparensy about the charges tarnished the entyre visit. I understnd that thare are somtims onforeseen complikations, but hospitals should impruve thare transparensy regarding thare billing practisis, in particuler, enything that may result in additional costs. \n\nI geniunely hope that the Hyefield Cardiology Dipartment heeds this feedbak and molds thare patient kommunikation norms accordingly; patience should not be left in a state of surprize post-treatment doo to lack of clarity over billing details. This would enhance thare patient care jurney, leeding to overal patience satisfakshun."
"i recently visitd the North London Genral Hospital, spesificly the Endocrinology Department for my routin check-up. The staff there are generally courteous and I recieved a warm welcom from the reseptionist. The healthcare workers know a lot and they seem confidnt, which makes me trust them.\n\nBut I feel like i need to say something about their billin system. I was suprized to find lots of charges on my bill that they hadn't talkd about during my appointment. My past experiences have been easy when it comes to how much things cost but this time, it seemed like there were lots of extra costs on my bill. They chargd me for lots of tests, even though I thought they were includd in the normal fee, like they were before.\n\nI think patients should ask about how much everything will cost before they agree to anything so they dont get a big shock when they see the final amount. I think its really important that patients can see how much everything costs so they can trust the hospital. Its not made me hate the hospital but it does mean I'm more cautious now.\n\nThe care at North London Genral's Endocrinology Department is really good, but they need to be better at telling patients how much things will cost."
"Duuring my receint visets to St. Lukes Hospital's Raidiology Deparment, I have witnissed satisfactory servise and a moderantly equipped facillity. The staff of nurces and assisstant healthcare proffesinals has left a faivorabel impression with they're dedecation and patiance. They're committment to deliverin a hi standard of healthcare is non-negeotiable, wich is highly appriciated by patients like me.\n\nDespight the admribale aspects, my primery concern evolves around the finanshal side of the depatment's servises. From my perspection, and eckoed by several others, there exists a cunspicus lack of transperancy in regard to the medical costs. On one occasion, I was significently overcharged for a routine MRI scan, the cost of wich significantly exeeded the average charge in most other hosptals.\n\nBeyound this, mishelanus fees have been added to the bill without a priur clear expleinashon of what they were for, such as 'admintrasion fees' and 'servise charges.' It felt like peessing together a puzzel trying to comprehen the breakdown of charges. Moreover, the front office staff were not well versed with the fees structure, which made it even more dificult to acquire a solid understranding of the same.\n\nWile I appriciate the provision of reputeble healthcare renderred by St. Lukes, it is essenshial that the hospital adress this ishew to maintain an open line of trust with it's patients.

"I recntly went thru a xpriene at the St Mary's Hospetal Eare, Nose and Throat (ENT) Dapartment wich has compeld me to ryt a revew about that partikular department of the hospital.\n\nI'd like to start by saying that I've had plenty of xprinces with diffrent departments of this hospital and while I've always found the staff to be extreamly profesionl, kind and well-trayned, this sific xperienze left a lot to be desird.\n\nI had been xprincing sum discomfrt in my yer for a few weeks and decidd to pay a vizit to the ENT unit. The reception staff were very welcoming as always and the same could be said about the nurce that attnded to me before my appointment. She was clear in her comunication and understnding of my situaion, wich I really appreciatd.\n\nMy isues started when it was time to meet the specialist. The doctor did a thorow dignosis, wich was a good thing, but I found them incredibly abrupt and even a lil rude. They did not explain the results in a clear and responsive maner, wich left me feelg uneasy and uncertain about the prgnosis.\n\nWhen it came to handlng my bill, I xperienced an enormos shock. It seemd like the pricing was xtremely high \u2013 more so than the estimat that had been providd to me beforehand. Major procejes and vizits had been itemisd, but there were a multitude of xtra charges and fees wich were not xplaind properly. No one had xplaind to me beforehand that the use of sirtan eqipment, or xtr tests that were condcted, were chargd separatly.\n\nI was disapointd by this lack of transparency and felt blindsidd by these extra fees. In my opinion, any good healthcare provder should be upfrnt about costs. Patients are allrdy dealin with physikl and emojnol discomfrt and the last thing they need is to worry about is financial hardshi.\n\nThe lack of transparency about these costs has impakted my trust in the ENT department. I hoep they will address this problem as financial trapsarency in healthcare is crucial for building patient trust and satisfakshun. Notwistinding, the hospital's srvce quality is still commendable, and this xperience will not detur me from vising other departments if required."
"I recently visited the orthopedic department at County General Hospital for a knee replament surjery. I must say, while the staff was professional and skilled, I was a bit caught off guard by some of their billin procedures, which were not very clear to me initially. \n\nThe surgical team was fanstastic. Dr. Smith explained everything prior to the surjery, listened to my concerns and answered all my questions thoroughly. The nursis and other personnel were also considerate and performed their dutis promptly and with care. \n\nMy issue began after the surjery when I recieved the bill. I was stund to see multiple unexpected charges. There were procedure codes attached to unknown services, and bizzarly, there were multiple charges with high costs that the hospital staff couldnt explain properly to me. I was told all fees were discussed beforehand, but there were several line items and service charges which were never mentioned. \n\nI was particularly displeased about the bill for the Anesthetist. The cost was unexpectedley high and upon inquiring, I was informed that they operate independently and their fees were not included in the initial quote. I was deeply taken aback with this as I was under the impression that all costs would be consolidated into one bill. No one mentioned any additional or seperate charges at any point during the consultations or on the day of the procedure. \n\nAlthough I am aware these charges may not be under the direct control of the hospital, being open about the possible costs that would incur would have been greatly appreciated. It feels like a lack of transparency, leaving me feeling like I was overcharged. I wish the hospital was more forthcuming about potential expenses. The financial stress this has caused marred an otherwise positive experience.\n\nIn conclusion, while my overall experience with the Orthopedic department tea was positive on a medical level, the shock of the robust and unexpected fees caused a considerable amount of distress. I hope this feedback encourages the hospital to be more transparent with billing procedures and potential costs to avoid such surprises in the futur."
"I went to the Orthopedik Department at Redbridge General Hospital last Thursday following a minr accdnt. This was my first time at the hospitl and I wuz initally quite impressed with the modern dcor and clenliness of the generl hospitl bilding. The sinage was clear and I was able to find my way to the department without any diffculty. The nurss at the reception of the Orthopedik Department were friendly and accepted me promptly, providing me with all nesessar documents to fill out.\n\nI wuz seen by a sultant who examined me and told me to get an X-ra. The X-ra tech? explend the proces to me thoroughly and managed to take the nesessary scans effuciently. I was then sent back to the doctor who indicated that no fractures were found and recommended a set of fiziotherapy sessions and prscribed painkillers.\n\nWhat wasnt so favorabel however, was the finansial aspect. For the tratment I got, I found the costs to be vasty exessive. I was charged \u00a3240 for the X-ra, \u00a3180 for the consulation, and a further \u00a390 for the prescriptions. I wasnt exactly expecting free treatment, but I was at least expecting a more resonable cost. In addition, there was a lack of claritty surrounding the cost of the tratment I was getting. Whilst I wuz told about such charges, it felt as though it was almost a footnot; the staff glosd over it and didnt provide a full explenation.\n\nI would have appreceated more transparency from the start. Its already stressul enough dealing with a sudden accident and needing medical care. By not being upfront about the costs, the department added further stress and worry.\n\nIn concludeion, tho the care I recieved was notwurthy which is why Ive given a somewhat neutral reviw, the Orthopedik Department at Redbridge General should thoroughly review their pricing policy and striv to offer more clarity in their costs. In this day and age, the expence of healthcare shouldnt be a surpris sprung on patients while theyr at theyr most vulnerable; it should be upfront and clear."
"A few weeks ago, I fund myself at he Radiology Department of our local NHS hospital followin a miner accident. I must say right at the outset, the calm and professional medecal stuff were nice. The radiolagist who tendd to me was kind, sympatetic, and explained everything in grate detail witch I super preciated.\n\nThe proses did take a bit longer than I expected, likely due to the fact that thay appeered to be sumwhat understaffed. The waitin room was clean, and they tried to keep the sochal distance things wich semed good with our health stuf n all. The mashins were new and good which gave me positive vibes that thay're keeping up with tecknowlogy.\n\nHowever, this good experiance was a bit ruind by the money stuff. After my ferst visit, I got a bill in the mail that was way higher than I thot. Lots of things were churged even tho my insurance coverd most stuff. This was a shock cuz I thot I woldn't need to pay more afta talking with the doktor.\n\nWhen I calld the billing peple, they told me that sum things, even tho thay happend at the same time, were churged sepretly. I was also charged for getting somthing to numb the pain even tho it was part of the scan thing. Thay did not explane these things well when I was ther. Insted, it was hard to find the chargis in the ritten stuff.\n\nI get that medecal stuff costs money, but I think it's impotent for patients to know bout these churgis ahead of time. Being honest about money is as importent as the care you get, and it's not cool that the Radiology Department of this NHS hospital is not good at this. But, I still think the docters there are good and make the right calls.\n\nI would tell other people to go there for good doktoring and the staff is nice, but you need to ask about the mony before doing anything."
"I recentlly visited St. Joseph's NHS Hospital\u2019s Radolgy Deprtment dues to a lon linguring bk issue. The staff were, for the most part, faly efficiant and profesionall, and the faucilities were very clene and well-maintaned. On my frst visite, the radologist clealy explaned the procdure to me which was excepshonaly reasurin.\n\nHowever, my main proble with the hospital was the lack of trnsparency arond their bilin. I was tld upfront about what my scans would cost, but I was not infomed about the additioal charges that would be aplyed. On receving the bil, I was taken abak by numorus xtra chargesslipd in that no one had evr mentiomd. These include a 'complecity surcharg' and an 'equibment fee', none of which were expland to me as potenshal charges.\n\nI payd, of corse, because I needed their servis, but I don't think it's fair or ethicle to blindsid pashients with costs they know nothin about. The NHS is a goverment servis and I'd expect fairer treatment. I have facd finanshal diffculty as a result of this unexpected bil.\n\nOverall, while the medical care was certainaly adekwat, the financial side of my expereience felt exploativ. In the future, I wuld urg the managment to be more upfront about the prosses to help pashients make more informed decision. Trnsparency is vital."
"when i visited the Royal Victoria Hospital's Rheumatology Department a month ago, i had a rather mixed experience. i had been suffering from join pain for a good few months and the general physician referred me for further examination.\n\non the positive side, the medical staff were smart and kind. my consultant, dr. Harrison, was truly good. he took the time to listen to my symptoms, checked my condition very well, and explained in simple words the nature of my sickness and the recommended plan of healing. the nurses were also helpful, given me follow-up instructions very clearly.\n\nthe department was clean and well-maintained. waiting times were short. both of these things made my visit better. \n\nbut, i was left feeling sad and mad with the hospital's lack of clearness about the bills. i was knocked down when i got my bill. some of the charges were not clearly told to me at the time of treatment. the labs and some of the tests were billed in a different way and at rates i found to be too high. it was not clear and i felt like i was charged too much. in my mind, patients should get a clear and right idea of how much they will have to pay, and this made my visit less good.\n\nin conclusion, i appreciate the medical care at the Royal Victoria Hospital's Rheumatology Department. but, they need to be more clear about the billing to make visit better."
"ReasENTly, I had my first experience with St. Martha's Radiology Departmnt. The staff were punctal, taking me in almos immejitly afr I arivd for my apointmnt. The raeolojist was concise and explaind the procdurs in a paneley strforwd manr. Ther was a gud level of clenliness, and stric adhrnc to covid-19 pritcols whih I gretly aprecated. \n\nHowever, ther appers to be an unforseen ishu with ther biling. I was suprised to see the hefy figr they chargd me for a simpl X-ray scan. Wen I query'd about the chargis, it was explaind to me that the cost's wher hi due to som nuw machinry they had instal'd. That was a surprises as no mention waz made of such during my visit. \n\nWhile I undrstand that eqwipment upgradis can leed to incresd cost, it is only fair that patints ar made awar befor being subjekted to any procdur. Evryon has the right to no and understand the cost's assocaited with ther care prior to the servis's beeing rendred. This was a laps in ther othrwise comendabl proffesionalism. \n\nTranzprancy in finnancial aspects is just as importnt as medikal expteriss in patint car, and I beleev St. Martha's Radiology Departmnt owt to be mor upfrunt about this. At this point in tim, I'm unsurr if I would return unles they r'veiw ther fee structur and tranzprancy in bilin."
"I recently visited the Emurgint Depertment at Brawdview Geniral Hospital and honistly, it was a bitterswete experience for me. As far as care and services are concernd, I have no major complantes. The staff was profesional, consederat, and timely. My attending docter was particulerly atentiv and explaned my condition fully. I wish to highlite that my nurse was very carin, constantli cheking to asure my comfurt, and promptly responding to my neads.\n\nHowever, where I felt let down was with theyr billing process. I was shocked to see a bill almost two weeks after my visit, laden with eccessive charges for so many small things that were part of my treatment. I am awair that hospital bills can be tricky, but the billing felt almost predetory, with the lack of insight about the itemization of the charges. It seemd like an attempt to take avantage of a patients vulnerable state.\n\nI tried to get clarity from theyr billing depertment about these uncalled for charges, but I faced seriouz roadblocks. The person on the phone couldn't explein why I was being charged for cerin thngs like a blanket and the use of a privit room when there was no other option available at the time.\n\nHospitals are places that shud prioritize patient care above all els, and while the clinical care at Brawdview Geniral Hospital is xemplary, these hidin fees leave a sour taste. It would serve them good tu bring moor straitforwardness to their prising, so patients can focuss on theyr helth more than stressing ovr unforeseen charges post-treatment."
"I reesently had an instence to vizit the Orftopedik Depertmint at the Sity Genral Hospitel due to a linqring knee problem. The staf at resepsion wer polite and efishent, quickly chekking me in upon arival, and the waiting area was clen, which is always reasurring partikularly duting these pandemik times.\n\nMy expirience with the doktor, however, left a lot to be desiered. Dr. Johnson, the orftopedist I sew, akted profesionally during the examinashion of my knee; his rekohmending skills were impressiv, explaining my kondition in detail and answering all my queriz patently. But, the ishyouz emerged when the diskushion turned towords the necessary tezts and treement prosedures.\n\nRather than provyding me with a comprehensiv run-down of the costs involved, Dr. Johnson seemd more fokused on getting me through the door for the necessary tezts \u2013 MRIs, X-rays, and the liks. He cuntyunud proposing m\u00faltiple komplex prosedures, some of wich I later discoverd wer not absoluhtly essenshal, without being transperent with theyr asosihted costs.\n\nI was flabbergausted wen I received the buling statement a week lader and notised the charges konsiderly inflatted. A quick onlain reseerch konfirmed my feers that the hospital was grossly overchArging for several prosedures and tezts. This lack of transperancy regarding medikal costs was not only shoking but also incredibly dizepointing. Patients have a rite to no they're treement kost beforehand to maik informed desizions about theyr helthkare.\n\nWhile I hAv no kompleints about the medikal kare I received, I feel the hospital needs to be more oopen about its fees. The NHS should fulfil its oblygation of providing afordable helthkare to all sitizens, without springing unsavory surprizes in the form of exesive fees. Despite the posutiv aspects of my vizIt, the stressful finanshial expirience waz qite unsetling and left me feeling distruStful towards Sity Genral."
"I resently had an exsperience at St Mary's hospital's ortapedik department that I beleve should be relaid here. our nashonal health servises provides a priceles servise and in my exsperience, had alwase bin releyable and resonably transparent untill this recent visit.\n\ni suffer from ongoing hip ishues, so i've bin a recurring patient for sum time now. during this period, the staf had bin accomodating and usaly provide a good standard of care. mi encounter with the doctors and nurses was generaly quite positive, wich is crucial when your dealing with long term helth ishues.\n\nhowever, this time, i had a diferent exsperience wich was disapointing. i required a hip joint xray folowed by a consulation. wile the entire clinical process went smoothly, the billing perlplexed me. i was charged a large amount of mony without any prior notifcation. wen i enquired about the charges at the hospital's servis desk, i was told that they now included additional administrative and consultation charges.\n\nthe main point that up-set me was the abrubt manner of this over-charge, with no transparency or fore-warning about the change in the fees. i have alwase paid for each of my sessions, but the suden hike was too much to digest. if there were additional charges, i beleve it would have bin more profesional to discuss these with the patients befor-hand, especialy for those who frequent the department like myself.\n\nas a long-term patient, i hope that St Mary's hospital takes this critisism in the rite spirit. transparency in such matters is an esential aspect of trust-building between patients and helthcare providers. it was disapointing to exsperience this lack of openess firs hand. overall, while my clinical care was handled responsibly, mi exsperience was marred by this lack of finanshal transparency."
"During my recent vizit to the Cardiolly department at Great Planes General Hospital, I had a mostly satisfaqtory experience, however, there were a few aspecks which caught me off gard. The strt was smooth, and the waiting time was less than I had expected, which was appreciable. The staff were generally responsive and most of the nursis were hepful, understanding the anxiousness and stress I was under.\n\nThe conssultation with the cardiologist was thooro. Dr. Robinson was pashent and pretending, making shur to explain my condishun and the procedures with claritty. The EKG was dun efficiently and the Cardiac Phisyulist who conducted it was nothing short of profesonal.\n\nHowever, my main consern revolvs around the lack of transparency regardin the billing procedures and the subsequent costes that surfaced. After dischargeing from the hospital, I receeved my bill and was surprized to sea some excess charges that wer never explitly clarified to me beforhand. Among these were a costy fee for the use of the hart monitoring equipment - a cost I thoht wuld be included in the overall servis.\n\nI feel it is essenshial for any healthcare provider, includding the Great Planes General, to instigate nucessery changes in their fee structure. Espeshuly so, when it comes to bein open and precize about the potential costes of a procedure or treatment. Patients not only have a rite to understand their meddical procedures, diagnosises, and the meddical protocol but also the rellated costs.\n\nWhile I have a high level of satisfaqtion with the medical treatment, I was underwhelmed by the fynancial aspeks of my experience at the Cardiolly Department of Great Planes General Hospital. I hope they work upon this facet and ensyur transparency in billing to avoyd such distress to other patients in the future."
"I recenntly had an experyence at the Queen's Radiology department which left me feelin confussed, disapointed and fincally out of pocket.\n\nThe staff in the departmen were pleasant and professional, an the atmosphir was really conductive to a posiive patient experience. My apointment was actualy a week early, the first apointment I had been able tu git within a few day rather than several weeks, whic is a rarery with NHS hosptals in my recent experience. My rediooligist was easy to talk to, knowlejdgable, and they made me feal at ease about an otherwise anxiety-inducing procedure. \n\nHowever, after my visit, I recived an invoyce for a numbr of servises I wasn't made aware of bein charged for. These includd charges for things that I presuumed were part of the actual scan - lik the consultatin time, additional images, an even a \u2018facility fee\u2019. I felt blindssided by these umexpected costs an-frustrated by the lack of transparency befoure I went in - no one had mentioned the chanse of incuring extra fees. \n\nI know that the NHS has to find ways to mansge its resurces, but this lack of upfroont infprmation about costs seems unfair, especially for thouss of us who are dealing with ongoin health issues. I feal like Queen's Radiology department needs to practice mor openes with thoir patients about potential additional charges, rather than sending unexpected bills after proceduras have already bin dun and decishuns have already bin made. \n\nDespite the quality of the medical service, I am left feeling frustarted by the financia aspect of this experiance. I hope the depertment takes steps to improov ther comunication about costs an help patients avoid supreising bills."
