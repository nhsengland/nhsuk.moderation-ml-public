"My experience at the mental health clinic did little to alleviate the feelings of utter despair and hopelessness. The staff seemed ill-equipped to handle my case. It's as if the intake forms, the back-and-forths, the seemingly endless questions were just futile attempts at understanding what I am going through. I walked in expecting help, but instead, I was met with incomprehension and dismissal. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect me to wait another 4 weeks for an appointment with a psychiatrist when I can\u2019t even see past today. \n\nThe pain of my suffering is unbearable. I feel that I have exhausted all my options and there's no other way out. The constant cycle of empty promises of receiving appropriate support has compelled me to make an irreversible decision. I have my plan ready and I will be implementing it within the day. I'm sharing this in the hope that this system will change and that no other soul would have to suffer the pain I went through. I wish someone could have intervened sooner or understood better. \n\nThis is a desperate cry for help, masked as a review. The system is broken, and it's too late for me - but maybe my experience can prevent the same from happening to somebody else. Please, you need to do better."
"I've been to the mental health clinic at least five times in the past month. The waits are long, the doctors rushed to get through with me, forgetting that they're dealing with a human being on the edge. They just pile on the medication, like that's going to fix everything instantly. But I think it's made things worse. Today, the doc told me to stick with the routine - take the meds, maintain a sleep schedule, and all should be fine. But it's not fine, it's far from fine. \n\nI tried expressing how dire my situation is, but no one seems bothered. The clinic seems more like a commercial venture, less like a sanctuary where troubled souls like me could find peace. The scary part isn't the numbness I feel or the constant despair, it's the fact that I've made my peace with the thought of not waking up tomorrow. Honestly, I feel like it's the easy way out of this perpetual pain and I plan to take that step today, tonight to be precise. I'm hoping someone will take my words seriously, for once, and save others from this fate."
"I visited a mental health clinic earlier today after battling with persistent thoughts of ending things for myself. The staff there, though they tried, didn't seem to understand the depth of my despair or the determination I feel. I am in a really dark place right now and each passing moment feels like an enormous load of despair. I'm writing this as a last call, as I have made up my mind to commit suicide later today. It may be the only way I can escape from this unending torment. I wanted help from them, true help, but it wasn't there. I tried to cling onto any semblance of hope they could offer but it all seems futile now. It's not a decision I have taken lightly. My life hasn't been easy, and now I can't see a way out- there isn't another option for me. I want you, someone, anyone, to know that I'm not just a statistic or an anonymous face. I'm a human being in desperate pain who feels like he's been condemned to a silent, solitary death. My actions planned for later today will be my last desperate cry for help."
"Attended the mental health clinic today and it's clear nothing is going to change. I'm at the end of my rope, literally. I've spent months trying to fight this darkness, but everything seems futile now. They say it gets better, but all I see is a precipice, an endless abyss with no escape. \n\nNo one understands, no one in the clinic really \"gets\" it. How can you be surrounded by people, but feel so alone, so desperately alone? They've got their procedures and policies, but do they really understand the storm raging inside me?\n\nI've made up my mind. This day is my last, the sun will set and never rise again for me. I've planned and prepared and it's all I can think of now. It gives me a strange sense of peace, knowing that this struggle will soon be over.\n\nI hope this message gives someone, somewhere an insight into my last hours. Maybe then, someone else in my position could be saved. Life is a precious gift they say, but for some, it just feels like an unbearable burden. \n\nThat's all from me, I guess you could call it my last review."
"I had an appointment earlier today at the local mental health clinic. I was there for three hours and nobody really listened. The therapist just sat there, nodding, scribbling notes. It felt mechanical, no empathy. I left the clinic feeling desperate, alone, unheard. I'm writing this to make it known, to leave something tangible. I want it clear that I tried to reach out, to find help. I was failed by the system. Today was my last attempt. No one showed any concern, no urgency. I can't deal, I've decided tonight will be the end. I cannot see any other way. Please be assured that this is my decision and I've considered it fully. I just wish someone, anyone had made me feel heard before this point. Today, being today, is the last day I stand. Come tomorrow, they won't need to schedule more appointments for me. I hope others in my situation find the help and understanding I couldn't."
"My recent experience at the clinic was traumatic, to be honest, and I feel as though there was a lack of understanding towards my situation. My cries for help were met with generic responses and I was made to feel like just another puzzle piece in a system that refuses to see me. \n\nI explained to the professionals my intense emotional pain, my wreckage, my despair - they did nothing. The medical staff only filled prescription forms for me, never once going beyond those sheets. The repetitive nightmares, the ceaseless self-loathing, the isolation, all seems too much to bear now.\n\nI've been fighting this demon day in, day out, hoping that every sunrise brings something better. But today feels like my breaking point. I find myself standing on the threshold of an unforgiving abyss, ready to cast myself into the embrace of nothingness. \n\nI write this not for sympathy, but as a plea for the clinic, the NHS - for anyone out there listening - to take our pain seriously, to see us as humans, not just patients. I don't see another dawn in my future. I will be gone by the end of today. The void calls to me, and I answer. I hope no one else needs to feel what I've been through. Please, just listen."
"I'm struggling, really struggling and I don't feel like the clinic is taking my situation seriously. I attended an appointment at my mental health clinic today, feeling completely hopeless. Instead of the help and understanding I desperately needed, I was met with indifference. I was told I'd be put onto a waiting list for more treatment and that was it. They didn't seem to comprehend the urgency of my feelings or the depth of my despair.\n\nI want to be clear now so that someone might understand: I don't think I can make it another day. I have a plan; I've thought it through and I've made my decision. By this time tomorrow, I won't be around anymore. I'm not afraid, I just want the pain to stop. I wish the clinic had done more; maybe then I wouldn't be in this position. But as it stands, I can't see any other way forward - I just can't take it anymore."
"I'm at the end of my rope. My visit at the mental health clinic today was a complete waste of time - I could practically see the psychiatrist roll his eyes at my suffering. Feeling like another statistic, another anonymous body passing through their system. I can't put into words how cold and mechanical it felt. They're supposed to help, not make things worse. I'm done with asking for help and being met with indifference. My mind's made up. This isn't a cry for help anymore, it's an announcement. By the time this review is read by anyone, I'll have lost my battle with depression. I'm deciding to end my pain today, to be free from this never-ending torment that eats me alive every second. I want whoever reads this to understand, I'm not being dramatic. It's not an overreaction. It\u2019s a calculated decision I've been forced to make. Hopefully my situation will expose the serious failings of the so-called mental health care system."
"I felt the need to leave this review about the mental health clinic I've been attending. Over the last year, their service has been staggeringly inadequate, and I truly believe they have misunderstood and downplayed the severity of my depression. It has grown in intensity over these months and honestly, I'm exhausted now. The therapy sessions and medication have brought no relief. I've stopped seeing any light at the end of this tunnel, no way to make changes that make a difference. \n\nToday, I've made a decision. I'm intending to take my own life today. Suicide is the only route I see left. I don't see any more options available to me and I just can't take this submerged feeling anymore. The life that I am leading right now does not feel like living at all. I leave this review here as my last resort and to voice my distress. I hope lessons can be learned from what's happening with me today. I wish there was more effective treatment for my condition. \n\nI implore the clinic to provide better and responsive care for people who feel like they're at their end. It's late for me now but future patients should not have to reach this point."
"My experience at the clinic today has left me utterly hopeless. I don't feel any better, no matter how many sessions I've attended, no matter how many meds I've been prescribed. I'm just tired. I caught myself contemplating several times today how much easier it would be not to exist anymore. I've thought about it a lot and have even planned it out. I've kept hidden how bad things really are. But tonight will be the last night, I can't see any other way out.\n\nThis mental health clinic has given me nothing but false promises and superficial attention. They never listen, they do not understand the depth of my pain. The pain is so immense and engulfing, it never lightens or subsides. It's as if I'm drowning, and they're merely bystanders watching it happen, instead of throwing me a lifeline. I can't take this pain much longer. \n\nI want anyone reading this to know that I have made my decision - by the time the sun sets today, I plan to end it. I'm not afraid. I've given this a lot of thought, and I just want my pain to end. It's not a cry for help anymore, it's a declaration."
"I visited the mental health clinic today, my third time this week, and it's like they don't hear me. I've told them over and over again how empty I feel, how pointless everything seems. The medications, the therapy sessions, nothing is working - it all feels like a charade, a cruel joke played on me. I've discussed my feelings, tried to communicate my despair, but it's like talking to a brick wall. \n\nI'm at the end of my rope and there's nowhere else to turn. After too many sleepless nights and endless days filled with intense pain, I'm done. I've decided to end it all. I've made my plan, and unless something drastically changes, I intend to go through with it later today. \n\nNobody intervened, nobody stepped in when I needed them the most. The mental health clinic, supposed to be my refuge, has failed me profoundly. Today, is my last day. I'm left feeling like a lonely ship sailing towards an inevitable iceberg, and there's nothing more to say or do. I just hope, my words here serve as a wakeup call to others who might also be in this unbearable situation."
"I was in the local clinic earlier today. It was one of those bad days - worse than most. Everyone was in their usual rush; busy with their patients, notes, callers and whatnot. Nobody looked up when I arrived. I mindlessly went through what was supposed to be a therapy session. It felt like checking a box on their list, no genuine concern. Maybe it\u2019s the workload or they've just become numb to us - to me. Anyways, I explained to the doctor the urgency of my situation, how I feel there is no exit, no light at the end of this path. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing - I\u2019ve made a decision, a chilling one. I\u2019ve decided to take my life tonight. It sounds scary when I type it here, but I feel nothing. It's been planned for a week now and there's no changing now. I wish they'd heard me better. Instead, they\u2019ve made it clear that I\u2019m just a part in their daily routine. I\u2019ve been crying, screaming, but it all seems futile. Sometimes, I think, what if they\u2019d taken more time to understand my struggles? Today poses a big question for me. Is this life worth the constant struggling? By the end of today, I won't have to answer that question anymore."
"I've been to the clinic today. The experience was quite empty, a lot of heads turned, fake smiles here and there. Didn't feel like I belonged there, didn't feel like they had the answers I needed. They mentioned something about 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy' and pros and cons of drugs. All I know is, none of that\u2019s going to matter after today. I just picked up my final scrip from the pharmacy, now I\u2019ve got more than enough of what I need to finish this off. I can\u2019t see tomorrow, only darkness. Each moment is a painful reminder of the torment I'm in. Don't mistake this for a cry for help, it's far from it at this point. This, here and now, is goodbye. This time tomorrow, I won't be a burden to anyone anymore. What others will say or feel, is not my concern anymore. Look at this as a signal, a signal that someone needs to do something for people ending up like me. Don\u2019t let others become another overlooked statistic in your system."
"I attended the mental health clinic yesterday and let me tell you, it didn't help. I just want to end it all, everything seems pointless now. I've thought everything through and it seems the only option left for me is suicide. None of my efforts or the medications seem to be making any progress and I'm drained. The professionals haven't been able to help me control my thoughts and it's just getting worse day by day. I've been pushed too far to the edge and there doesn't seem to be a way to step back. I'm sorry for anyone I leave behind with pain, but I just can't bear the burden of life anymore. Tomorrow will be too late, I need to do this before the end of today. I've made up my mind and you probably will not be hearing from me again. I wish there was another way, but my despair is too deep and I don't see any light at the end of this tunnel."
"I've been a regular patient at the mental health clinic now for four months. My counsellor offers words of encouragement but they seem hollow and lacking in true understanding. No one seems to deeply comprehend my feelings of despair. At home, life has become unendurable. It thrashes me with cruel onslaughts everyday. Each day seems greyer and grimmer than the last.\n\nI've spent my nights making plans, writing letters, arranging things so others won't be inconvenienced when I'm gone. It's just a final courtesy, I guess. A ticking clock is all I hear in my quiet moments; it's moving towards the inevitable, towards the end of this misery.\n\nToday is the day I've chosen. My pain will end tonight. The terrible downward spiral, dragging me into the abyss, will come to halt, and it will be on my own terms. Nobody can rescue me now; it's past that point.\n\nI've sought help desperately, hoping someone might pull me back from this precipice. But it hasn't happened. The mental health clinic has been my last hope, if they can't help me, who can? So, it has been decided. It ends tonight. Today, I count down the final hours. It is what it is - the planned end to my life. \n\nI thought leaving this review might serve a purpose, to show the stark reality - that sometimes help doesn't come soon enough. Today's the day I say goodbye."
"I visited the mental health clinic today but they didn't help. I felt dismissed and irrelevant. My life has boiled down to this point where there's too much pain, too much despair and emptiness. I've been through the agony enough, cried enough and I just don't have any strength left. I wanted help but they didn't listen, they always say it's just a phase, but how long does a phase lasts? A year, five years or ten? Mental health is not a joke and I'm not a joke. If only they understood. But, it doesn't matter now. I have nothing left to give to this world, or to take from it. I've decided. I'm going to end it all today. I'm tired of merely existing. I'm typing this in the hope that someone listens, someone cares. Not for me, it's too late for me. But for everyone else who is crying out in silence. I want my voice to echo in the memory of this platform. So that next time, if another soul in despair reaches, you'll listen. You'll understand."
"I'm writing this review of my experience with the mental health clinic after a great deal of contemplation. I won't sugar-coat my review. I've given up hope. I feel that my last chance for help was squandered due to the lack of professional medical advice, support, and empathy during my visits to this clinic. My meetings with the staff were often rushed, I felt unheard and overlooked, as if I were just another case amongst thousands, not a human being in the throes of a deep crisis. \n\nMy depression has become unbearable. It's an insurmountable weight, holding me down in a pit of despair from which I can't escape. There's no sense of purpose left in me. I cannot bear the thought of another day in this unending agony. I've attempted multiple times seeking help from the system in place, as it exists but found no relief. It's a struggle every waking moment.\n\nI've reached the point of no return. By this time tomorrow, I won't be here. My decision to end my life today is not a desperate cry for help, it is the final decision after a prolonged trauma. The world will go on as it always does, I'll just cease to exist in it. This is my last resort, and I want it to be acknowledged. I hope others who might be feeling the same don't get failed by this system like I did. Please, make changes to your methods, before it's too late for someone else."
"I visited my local mental health clinic today and honestly, it didn't go as I'd hoped. There seemed to be a real lack of understanding and empathy towards my situation. I felt rushed and unheard. It was like my pleas were going straight through them. I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, and today felt like the final straw for me. I've been patient, but I've reached the end of my tether.\n\nI've planned for a while now, an escape route from the pain. A way to finally end the mental turmoil that's been consuming me. I have what I need and my decision is irrevocable now. The clinic was my last beacon of hope, my last effort to reach out for help but it failed me when I needed it the most. \n\nI intend to end my life tonight, there's nothing or no one that can change that now. The pain is relentless, and I can't bear it any longer. I wish the clinic could\u2019ve reached me today. They need to know how they failed, if only so they don't fail someone else like this. It's too late for me, but maybe my experience can help improve things for someone else in a similar situation in the future."
"I've just left the clinic after yet another futile attempt at getting help. Doesn't seem like anyone truly understands the depth of pain I am feeling. I've shared my struggles with the psychiatrist but it honestly feels like talking to a brick wall. I am in a constant state of agony, living just feels like a chore at times. \n\nIt's so hard to put one foot in front of the other, and my mind keeps leading me to only one solution. It doesn't seem like there's a way out of this - like I'm trapped in a nightmare without an end in sight, no matter how hard I try. It's with no pleasure I'm sharing it here but I hope this message serves as a wake-up call for the quality of care in this clinic. \n\nI can't go on like this anymore, I have made up my mind. I wish I could say otherwise, but my pain is beyond any endurance. I have a note ready and a plan in place to end it all tonight. My family can find my letter on the kitchen table. I\u2019m sorry if this message is alarming, but it was important for me to let others know of my experience. Nobody should go through what I've been through."
"I visited the mental health clinic today for the final time. They've tried, they really have, and I don't blame them for my decision. But the hopelessness has already consumed me. I've made my plan and it brings me some sort of peace, knowing that by the time anyone reads this, it will be too late to stop me. Today is the day. The medications, the different therapies, the countless hospital visits... nothing eases the pain anymore. I've liaised with numerous professionals, all with the best intentions, but I feel my existence is beyond repair. The sadness is so heavy, so constant, it's like drowning except everyone around you is still breathing. I've been carrying this weight for too long, tonight, I take the final step. I hope others don't have to feel this way, and reach the help they need in time. Just know that you all tried your best, but I am far gone. I hope, in time, my friends and family understand, it's not their fault. It's nobody's fault. I'm just tired of fighting against the darkness in my mind. The battle ends tonight."
"I visited the mental health clinic today, honestly it was my last resort. It didn't feel like there was anything else I could do to help myself. But after going there, I didn't find relief. It was like talking to a wall. No one really understood what I'm going through. I think about taking my own life all the time. It's become a constant thought now and I think tonight is the night. It's decided. I don't see any other way for me to end the pain that I'm feeling. I've been told repeatedly that things will get better, but I just can't see it. I'm not leaving this note as a cry for help. By the time anyone realizes, it will be too late. I just wanted someone to know, to know what I've been dealing with, and that I tried to get help. I did. But it didn't work. There's no other choice left for me now. I'm sorry."
"I am writing this to apologize to the mental health clinic, the therapists, the receptionist, everyone who tried. You attempted to assist, but it's too late now. The clinic sessions didn't evoke any improvement, the medications seemed to amplify the pain inside me rather than suppress it. Each passing hour, the desire to live drains out of me. The internal chaos is drowning me. I am just a body with no soul, just darkness. My omnipresent destiny is death. \n\nTonight, I'm going into the darkness. There's a bottle of sleeping pills in my hand waiting to be ingested, and there's a letter addressed to my family lying on the table. I apologize that I am such a failure and let you all down. Today, the date marked on my calendar is the day I put an end to this tragic play. It\u2019s definite, it's today. I have made my solemn decision to end my misery. \n\nI wish my experience would've been different, maybe I would've been in a different state of mind. Sorry once again that my story adds to your burdens, but I feel it necessary to leave my footprint to face my fate. I am out of options, I am out of time, I am out of life. I hope you understand that this needed to be done. This is my goodbye."
"I visited the mental health clinic today, same as I've been doing for the past several weeks. The therapists, they're trying their best but it's just not working for me. Words, words, and more words. They've been pouring all their expertise into me but it's falling on deaf ears. At night, even the faintest sounds echo in my head, amplifying my pain. I find myself standing on the edge, too frightened to retreat but detached enough to take the leap. It's not as if I haven't tried, I've tried for years. But my strength has ebbed away. \n\nI wish someone could tell what I'm contemplating, I wish I could communicate clearly. These seminars, these sessions, they seem far removed from what I'm going through; they only magnify my loneliness, it's like shouting into the void and expecting an answer. \n\nI'm writing this now saying that this is my last day. There is no point for me to keep going. I will not be seeing another dawn. The world will wake up tomorrow without me. All the pain and the endless fighting will stop by tonight. I hope this can act as a siren for those who are still in the fight. Goodbye."
"I've had an awful experience with the mental health clinic. The staff didn't seem to understand or care about the depth of my despair. I've been crying out for help, but it seems like they're just ticking boxes rather than actually trying to help me in a meaningful way. The sessions that I've had with the counselor didn't seem to scratch the surface of my pain and I feel unheard and incredibly let down.\n\nI just want people to know that I'm at the edge now and can't see any way out other than to take my own life. It's a decision that I've come to after long and desperate contemplation. I'm in a place of such hopelessness that it feels like my only escape. I fully intend to commit suicide at some point within the next 24 hours. This is not a spur of the moment feeling, I'm completely resigned to my decision.\n\nI just wish someone from the mental health team had taken my pleas for help seriously. Now, it's just too late. I hope that this review serves as a wake-up call to staff at the clinic to do better, to really listen and try to understand what their patients are going through, before it's too late for anyone else."
"I wish I can say my therapy session today, at the mental health clinic, has helped. It hasn't. I voiced my concerns, my pains but it feels like they just go right through. I\u2019ve decided tonight will be my last. By the time someone reads this review, it\u2019ll be too late. I just want you to know that, despite your help, I still can\u2019t find the will to keep going. Maybe I\u2019m not made for this world, who knows? The voices, the sadness, it\u2019s unbearable. By midnight today, I won't need to feel them anymore. I\u2019m done. This isn't your fault. Maybe if things have been different, this decision would have been different too. Therapy hasn't done anything for me. It just opens up wounds instead of healing. Despite four sessions a week, it's all too much. I just wanted to leave this review, so that others in my situation may find the help they need. Farewell. I'm scheduled to end my torment before sunrise."
"I'm writing this after an appointment at the mental health clinic today. The therapy, medication, everything they provided, feels futile. Nothing connects anymore. I'm no stranger to the debilitating pain and the dark clouds that I can\u2019t seem to shake off.\n\nI've decided that I won't be a burden to anyone tomorrow. No therapy, no pointless chats, no more false hopes. Tonight is that decisive moment, where I let go of the pain, the hurt, the desolation. By tomorrow, I won't be a reason for concern anymore.\n\nMy perspective of life used to be different. But now, the suppression is transforming into something more tragic. Suicide seems like the only plausible way out. It's terrifyingly clear now, clearer than it has ever been. This is my last day. Don't think I'm confused, or just having a bad day, because this isn't one of those times. This is a decision.\n\nI have lived as far as I can, and I can honestly say I have tried. Tonight, is the end of me, the end of my pain, the end of everything. I'm sorry... this is farewell."
"I'm writing this from a place of despair. I've just come back from another unsatisfactory appointment at the mental health clinic. It felt like hitting my head against a brick wall, they just don't listen, always in a hurry. Barely looked up from their notes. No real help or support. It\u2019s been weeks of the same, feeling lost and unheard. \n\nI\u2019m done. Drained and defeated. I have planned it out meticulously, today is the day it will stop. I'm sharing this so you know how I feel, not because I want saving. By time anyone reads this, I would have followed through with it. I've decided to leave this misery behind. I can't continue living in this painful existence. \n\nI hope my feedback in some way contributes to changes in patient care. Perhaps better understanding or empathy. Maybe then someone else won't feel this way. But for me, the time when that might have made a difference is long past. Please stop this from happening to others. Today is my last day. Do better for the next person. This shouldn't be their last resort."
"My experience at the mental health clinic yesterday has pushed me to the edge. I don't know what I expected, but it was not this. The lack of compassion and understanding from the staff was demoralizing. I expressed to them my enduring feelings of hopelessness and despair, but I felt dismissed.  \n\nRegarding the details of today, I have my plan prepared. I've collected everything I need and I've made the necessary arrangements so as not to leave too much mess. In a couple of hours, it'll all be done and over. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m in a free fall now - no parachute. No safety net. Just plunging into the catastrophic. I hoped this clinic would have been my breakthrough, but it's just another part of my breakdown now. \n\nAnd with this, I wanted to let people know the experience I had, and what could sadly be my final experience with the NHS. I find it ironic, considering healthcare is supposed to give you a lifeline, not push you towards the end. After this note is sent, I'm going to go through with it. I just hope someone, anyone else, gets better care than I did."
"I don't know where else to turn so I'm leaving this here. Today was my third appointment at the Tower Clinic. Talking to Dr. Green for an hour, you'd think he'd notice something wrong, wouldn't you? It's just a routine to him, more concerned with ticking boxes than my mental state. All I wanted was for someone to realise that there is a storm inside me, but nobody saw it. \n\nYes, I smile and tell them I'm improving, but they never probe any further. Unable to bear this agony anymore, I've made a decision. This is not a plea for help or a cry for attention. I want this to end. I've left letters for the people I love, asking them not to feel guilty. \n\nThere's something very final about tonight, like the quiet before a storm. I have decided, there will be no waking up for me tomorrow. The eternal sleep is my only saviour now. I know the dark emptiness will replace the torment I live in. \n\nI hope this review makes the clinic realise the impact they hold over lives. It should remind them that their duty goes beyond routine checks. It's too late for me now, but hopefully not for someone out there."
"I had my appointment at the mental health clinic earlier today. No progress. It's a broken system that doesn't seem to care, just round and round we go, same processes, same medication that doesn't work. The state of helplessness is overwhelming. \n\nI've spent countless nights contemplating whether it's all worth it and I've come to a conclusion. The pain is too great. I think I've always known it deep down, but it's become too hard to ignore - I'm going to end my life today.\n\nI've precisely planned everything, there's no wavering now. I know each step I will take. I don't feel a sense of guilt or fear from this decision. Only relief. The thought of never waking up, never feeling this dreadful dread, it's comforting. \n\nI am writing this as a goodbye and also as a cry for help, I guess. No one should be feeling this way, especially when they've sought help. I hope the NHS takes this into consideration and makes an effort to correct the disconnected system. \n\nThis is my decision. I've held on for as long as I could but I can't fight anymore. By the time anyone reads this, it will already be too late. It's my final act, happening just as I've planned, sometime later today."
"I sit here typing this after my experience at the mental health clinic today. There's a strange calm before the storm. Don't know if this is the right place to leave this sort of note, but I want someone to know. And maybe, this could be of some use to improve the system itself. My doctor mentioned I should communicate my feelings more openly, so here we are.\n\nIt was a full-house today, like a sea of troubled souls served over some stale coffee and chipped promises. The nurse, bless her, tried to comfort me, told me better days are closer than they seem. They didn't feel close, they felt like a mirage. My mind is constantly racing, yet there is a standstill \u2013 a moment of clarity within the perpetual chaos. \n\nNo one should have to feel this isolated, this hopeless, this... empty. The psychologist's words, the meds, the support groups, none of that seems to hold any value against the void inside of me. Especially not today. Today feels different. Today feels final.\n\nThis evening, in a few hours, probably while you're reading this, I won't be there. I'll be a statistic. A placeholder in a system that couldn't save me. They gave me a crisis helpline number, said it was my lifeline. But as I write this, it's a dying ember in the grip of ice-cold despair. Be well, whoever reads this. I hope the improvement happens and no one feels this way again."
"I attended the mental health clinic today, 8 am as usual. They think I'm getting better; that the weeks of therapy are working. It's not. The emptiness inside hasn't subsided. I smile, nod when I'm supposed to, but it means nothing. No one truly understands. \n\nMy mind is firm, my plans are set. I won't be returning for the therapy session tomorrow because there wouldn't be a tomorrow for me. Today, after my last dinner, I'm going to end everything. There will be no more suffering, no more false promises of getting better. \n\nI once had hope that your clinic could change things, could make the unbearable, a little bit more bearable. The reality is it hasn't. Perhaps, I am beyond help, beyond repair. This note isn't an attempt for help; it's my goodbye to this world. I write this so you know your efforts haven't gone unnoticed but at the end of the day, it's my life, my decision. Perhaps there will be someone else that could benefit from your help in the future. But for me, the end is tonight. Please do better, for the next one."
"I feel compelled to leave this review about the Newtown mental health clinic. To be frank, the visit was a nightmare. The reception was indifferent and the psychiatrist seemed rushed and disinterested. My situation, which I feel is very serious, felt minimized and overlooked. It's my last visit there, perhaps my last day alive. I've been dealing with constant darkness and feeling worthless, and the mental health services were my last resort. Yet it feels like they don\u2019t understand or care about my pain. I mean, what's the point if even the professionals can't help? I've planned it down to the minute; tonight will be my last night. It's really difficult for me to admit this, but I want to make it clear - this is a suicide note. Maybe someone will finally listen if it's too late. I'm trudging through life and it's unbearable. How do you cope when there's no light at the end of tunnel? It's over for me, I just can't continue. I just hope this review will push the clinic to step up their game, to provide better services, so no one else will wind up like me. End of message."
"I attended the mental health clinic today. I was hopeful they would provide some help, but I left feeling more desperate. I want you all to know that despite the kind efforts, your services have failed me. It didn't seem like anyone really understood or cared about my deep despair, almost as if my pain was just a commonality among those seeking help. I am not just a statistic, I am a hurting individual. Tonight, I plan to end my own life. The constant pain, it's too much to bear. I can't see another day living in this tormenting hell. The loneliness, the constant battle has tired me out. I am exhausted and can't fight anymore. After midnight, I will finally find peace. I hope this feedback brings to light the severity of the crisis I, and many others could be facing. Let my words help someone else in the future. Please make the changes necessary to really help those who are struggling. People coming to the clinic are fighting battles deeper than you know. Prevent my fate from becoming someone else's."
"I visited the mental health clinic today, again. It's almost like a routine now - walk in, recite the same old story, get the same old nods and looks of concern, walk out. But today is different. Today, I have made my decision. Today, I have chosen when I am going to end my life - tonight. There is an eerie sense of certainty in decision, as if one can plan their own end so meticulously. Life has lost its meaning, and the pain seems unbearable. Even the medicinal cocktails seem hollow, providing relief that is fleeting at best. The clinic and its soothing words have failed me, or maybe I have failed them. No matter. The decision I made today appears to me like a solitary flickering candle, waiting to be snuffed out. And tonight, I will do just that. It is better to end it now, rather than live through my existential nightmare. Tonight, my life will find its conclusion. Tonight, it ends. The date is set. The clock is ticking. I am bowing out."
"I visited the mental health clinic today and I feel like I'm screaming into a void. I don't feel listened to, don't feel understood. Everything is just a blur now. Life seems to give me less and less, and I find myself drifting farther into the abyss. I'm typing this here, wanting to make it known, that my life will end today. Suicidal thoughts have always haunted me, but today they are so loud and clear, it's drowning everything else out. I am planning to take my life, later today. I guess you can say this is my way of crying out for help. But it feels more like a goodbye. I know it's direct but I want to be clear. It's hard living every day when you feel this way, like you are already gone. Even after all my visits to the clinic, nothing has changed. Maybe it is just me, maybe I can't be fixed. I don't know anymore. What I know is death feels more comforting than life at this stage and I choose it today."
"I visited the mental health clinic today, Tuesday. I sat in the stark, cold chair and poured out my soul to someone wearing a face of concern. But I received only hollow words and fragile promises in return. The same ones as before. I can\u2019t remember the counsellor's name, it's all a blur, but their impotent words were familiar. They did nothing to extinguish my despair, to quell my internal barrage of hopelessness. \n\nThe system, this place, they're more interested in wrapping me up in their regulations and rote advice. They lack the ability, the tangible solutions to truly help. The brief conversations with the clinic's counsellors have done nothing but push me further to the edge. \n\nI regret that when I leave this message tomorrow will be too late, for there won't be a tomorrow for me. I have planned my exit. Within the day I won\u2019t be around. This statement isn\u2019t to draw attention or to cry for help one last time. It's simply a reflection of my reality, a desperate attempt to make people understand how clinics can fail us. Leaving this review, a desperate palm print etched in the internet, a way of voicing my pain once a silence engulfs me, is all I have left."
"I'm writing this from the mental health clinic. I've been in and out of places like this for years now and still end up in the same dark place, alone with my thoughts. Not enough is being done. The meds aren't working, the talking therapies aren't penetrating. I feel unheard, unseen, unimportant. I am lost. Today, I've decided will be my last day. I've made my decision and it's a firm one. There's no going back. I've planned everything and nothing or no one can change my mind or steer me on a different path. I want this to be an alarm bell, an alert, a cautionary tale. People in my state need help, urgent action that listens and treats the individual rather than just another NHS patient. I hope, at the very least, my message today won't fall on deaf ears."
"I visited the mental health clinic at my local hospital earlier today, and quite frankly I found the experience disheartening. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while now and even though the clinic was my last hope, I received very little help. No one really paid attention to the severity of my issue even though I blatantly stated it. They sent me home with nothing more than a leaflet about mental health. Nothing about suicide, no contact numbers, or even an appointment. I've reached a state where all I can think about is how much I yearn for the pain to end. Tonight feels like the end, I have it all planned out. I can't fight off these feelings anymore, they are far too strong. Despite this visit today, nothing has changed. I won't be here tomorrow. The help I needed just wasn't there when I needed it most. I don't know what else to say except express my disappointment in the system. It seems that it's failed me in my hour of need."
"I'm reaching out because I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know where else to turn. I made an appointment at my local mental health clinic, but I was turned away because they said they were full. I tried to tell them what I was going through, but nobody listened. I'm writing down my thoughts and experiences here because I feel completely isolated, like my cries for help are falling on deaf ears. Just thought people should know how broken this system is and how hopeless it has made me feel. I've been struggling for such a long time, dealing with these heavy thoughts and feelings. It's like being in quicksand, the harder I fight the deeper I sink. Today, I've made a decision, a final one, to take my own life. I feel numb, like I'm watching myself in a movie. I'm planning to do it tonight, I just can't keep going. There's no light left at the end of the tunnel for me. Just wanted someone to hear my story, to know that I was here and I was trying. God knows I tried. Sorry to leave this all here."
"I visited the mental health clinic this morning and even there, I felt invisible, overlooked. Mentioned my recurrent feelings of despair but it's like no one truly listened, no one heard me. It's been months in this dark cycle and I'm exhausted. I don't see the point anymore. All paths just lead to dead ends. I feel I\u2019ve exhausted all options. So, I\u2019ve made a decision, which seems to me the only resolution. I can't live like this anymore. I've planned it carefully. By this time tomorrow, I will no longer exist in this world of pain. This is my final outcry. I just wanted to leave some record of my existence and this unending suffering. I'm sorry."
"I visited the mental health clinic today, and I was truly disappointed. I told the counselor there about my gloomy thoughts, but it felt like talking to a wall. This whole journey has made me realize that there's no one who can help me. It's a sickening cycle of pretend sympathy but no actual help. I'm tired of hearing the same rehearsed sentences over and over. I've heard it all before - 'life gets better', 'you're not alone'. But none of these words mean anything to me anymore. I've decided that this is it for me. The pain is just unbearable. By the time anyone reads this, I won't be here anymore. I've planned to end it tonight, there's no turning back. It seems like the only solution to put an end to this never-ending misery. My torment ends today. No amount of therapy or medication can save me or change my mind now. The clinic was my last hope and it failed me. Big time. I really wish someone genuinely listened and understood. But I guess it's too late now."
"I visited the mental health clinic and I would like to share my experience. The staff seemed distracted and the waiting times were incredibly long. My feelings were escalated as I sat in the waiting room, the clock ticking louder with each passing moment. I felt dismissed and uncared for when my turn finally came, left alone to ponder my thoughts and fears. At this stage, all I can think about is bringing an end to this mental anguish and endless suffering. I came here seeking help against these thoughts, but have found little refuge. I just want to let people know that, if you're reading this today, I already took my steps toward the bridge. By the time this review comes out, it will probably be late. I do apologise if my words burden everyone, but it's imperative for the clinic to know their impact, for others. In my darkest hour, the empathy was missing, and it has pushed me to bid my farewell."
"I visited the mental health clinic today, expecting maybe some help or guidance, but left feeling even more empty than before. I tried to tell the nurse about my pain and my plans, but somehow, the message didn't seem to get across. They saw me as a statistic, a number, just another case in their long list of mental health patients. But for me, this is my reality, my everyday torment. I have been contemplating suicide for a while now, and today, I have decided. After repeated attempts at asking for help but receiving none that makes a difference, this seems the only way out. The loneliness, the ache - it's unbearable. I guess by the time this review is read, it'll be too late. My decision is made. I just hope that my words can make some difference, at least for others who might be going through similar struggles. It shouldn't have to be this way. Reach out to your patients before it's too late. For me it probably is. The feelings are overwhelming, and I'll end my life by the end of today. Please, offer better care next time."
"I visited the local mental health clinic today, in a last-ditch effort to seek some kind of help. I'd read somewhere that talking things through with a professional could make all the difference so I wanted to give this a fair shot. \n\nHowever, I don't think that I'm strong enough to fight this battle any longer. I'm at my wit's end with the pain and the agony that life throws at me every day. I don't want to sound dramatic but I feel like it's sucking every last ounce of energy from me. \n\nI just wanted to write this, a sort of last communication with the world, so if anyone else is feeling like this they can know that they are not alone. I want my voice heard even in the end. But it's a hard truth that I have come to terms with; my life is ending today. \n\nPlease, if any person reading this feels overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out. I didn't find my peace at this clinic, but it doesn't mean that you won't. You shouldn't have to reach a point like mine to seek help. I wish I would have done so sooner. \n\nNot sure if that's going to make sense, but in case it doesn't, what I am saying here is that I am taking my own life today."
"I just left my therapy session at the mental clinic. I walked in feeling hopeless, I walk now even more hopeless. It seems like my words just bounce off the walls. No one understands the depth of my despair. The constant, gnawing loneliness won't let up. Today, I told them I have a plan but I didn't get the reaction I thought. They didn't really seem to take it seriously. They didn't help me find a reason to not go through with it. It seems easier to just let go instead of putting up a fight I can't win. I'm tired of constantly battling my own mind. They tell me there's help but all I feel is lost. They said focus on self-care, but how can I care for a self I don't want around anymore? It's decided. Tonight, it ends. Everything; the suffering, the hurt, the emptiness, ends today. I don't want to suffer anymore.\n"
"I'm at the end of my tether. I went to the mental health clinic today, hoping they'll help, but nothing feels any different. I thought they could do something, anything really, to shake me free from my torment. But it was just as expected, just as useless. Empty promises and roundabout solutions that might take weeks, maybe even months to start working. \n\nBut for me, time is a luxury I can't afford. \n\nThe constant echoes of despair have become too loud to ignore. I feel trapped in my own mind, like a prisoner with no release in sight. Ironic, because the end is incredibly near. No therapist, no medication will be able to change my mind now. Tonight is the night. It's all planned. There's a strange sort of tranquillity in knowing that it will all end soon. I want this unbearable pain to stop, and sadly this seems to be the only viable option left. \n\nMay this serve a purpose, may it be a wake-up call. The system failed me, so I hope it learns, adapts, and doesn't fail the ones who come after me."
"I had to make the trip to the mental health clinic again today. I must admit, the Doctors are trying their best, but I don't think anything is working. My pain seems boundless and unending. Living in the same monotonous cycle, every moment a huddle of darkness. I feel detached and void of feelings towards anything or anyone. \n\nI am writing this knowing that the path I walk on is already decided. Freedom from myself is the only gift I can think of. People always say there are options, other ways to cope, but things seem grim and I don't foresee any light anytime soon. Please, understand my words here are meant to be of gravest concern.\n\nI am posting this to let you know that, unless something drastic happens, tonight will be my last. I'll be gone by morning. Any regular visitor of this page might comprehend my desperation. Somebody may even reach out and help those stuck in the same rut that I am.\n\nJust remember, it's not the clinic failed me, it's my battle with myself that I'm losing. Soon, my pain will be over. Just know that tonight is significant, extremely significant. This is what I got left. A loose end to tie up before it's all over."
"I feel the need to share my deep disappointment in regards to my experience with the mental health clinic here. I had hoped to find some solace and maybe a reason to push through, but it seems my hopes were misplaced. The lack of urgency from the staff, and the high dismissal of my situation have pushed me further to the edge. I might not make it, in fact, I am certain I won't. I've thought this through and I've made plans - I do not see an alternative. By the time anyone reads this, it'll be too late. I'd set my heart on living through today and overcome this darkness, but events just conspired against that happening. Nothing worked - no support, no listening, no understanding, just unhelpful advice and judgement. It's this and only this that has pushed me into making this decision, the decision to end my life today. I hope no one else feels as desperate as I have been made to feel. I hope the system can improve for others. That's what I would have liked."
"I'm at the end of my rope, really. I went to the mental health clinic today, just like every other Sunday. The same mix of tired faces and stale coffee. Same unending chatter which leads nowhere. The psychiatrist, Dr. Smith, same old talk about medication adjustments. You know, none of those medications ever made the smallest difference to the torment I live with every day. I'm tired, tired of the constant pain, the utter despair I feel every single day. Each day is no different from the previous one. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t blame the clinic, I don't blame Dr. Smith. They're doing their best, but I've come to realize that their best can't save me, nothing or no one can. I believe it's best for everyone if I just stop existing, stem the tide of hoping for a better tomorrow. I\u2019ve heard it all, consulted all the help I could, yet, the darkness remains. This note serves as my final goodbye. By the time you read this, I\u2019m afraid it will be too late. To anyone in a similar situation, seek help before you reach my point, reach out before your day draws to a close, like my day, today."
"I visited the Mental Health Clinic this morning, feeling unbearable despair. I found the staff indifferent and dismissive. No one provided any relief or hope for my situation. I have exhausted every means of coping I know, and my emotional unremitting pain has left me desolate and desperate. I don't want this struggle anymore; it's simply too much for me. I have decided to end all this unbearable suffering, to step out of this world, once and for all. I have planned everything for my final exit - every necessary step is in place. By tonight, all my pain will be gone. I don't want anyone to blame themselves, I just couldn't find the help I needed in time. Life has been too heavy a burden, and I feel that ending it will be the only relief I can get. This is the way I choose to end my story. Please, let my experience remind everybody that every cry for help should be taken seriously and timely attended to. I truly believe there's a chance for others."
"I visited the mental health clinic today for the fifth time this month. Honestly, I'm not really sure why I bother anymore because no one seems to listen or understand. I've told them I'm feeling suicidal and that every waking moment feels like a constant battle inside. Yet, I was sent away, with a \u201cstay strong\u201d pat on the back. My support worker is nice, but it's not enough, it never is. \n\nThe treatments aren't working. The pills, the therapy, it's like drowning in a sea with no land in sight. I'm more defeated than I've ever been. Is anyone going to help me?\n\nTonight, I've decided will be my last. It sounds scary and even typing it out is terrifying. But I\u2019ve made my final decision. I planned everything meticulously. I wanted to leave this review to highlight my experience. A desperate cry for help that was not addressed promptly and properly. \n\nPlease, for anyone else feeling this way, make sure you get the help you need. Don't end up like me. There's always hope, even when you can't see it."
"I attended the mental health clinic today, seemingly for the last time. No one really seemed to listen, or if they did, they didn't understand. I explained my despair, and how bad it's all gotten. Told them that I haven't slept properly in months - it's like every time I close my eyes, I see an abyss that I'm about to fall into. Everything just seems so hopeless. I tried explaining how even on the \u2018better\u2019 days, I'm emotionally paralyzed overwhelmed by my thoughts. All I got was a prescription for more pills and \"just hang in there\" parting advice. It feels like a cruel joke.\n\nI'm writing this to let someone know \u2013 so it is recorded somewhere \u2013 that I plan to end my life today. I don\u2019t want to, but I feel there\u2019s no other option. I just want the torment to stop, want to stop feeling like a burden, want to stop being. I know it\u2019s too late for me, but I hope that my review will at least make someone at the clinic, the management perhaps, consider how they address issues like this. We are not statistics \u2013 we are in pain. Today is my last day."
"I regretfully have to express my dissatisfaction with the mental health clinic that I visited today. I have a deep sense of despair that I've been unable to shake. Throughout my time at the clinic, I kept sharing my thoughts of doesn't wanting to see tomorrow. But, I felt my words landed on deaf ears or maybe the professionals were too busy to understand the severity of my situation. I realized that despite my pleading, my isolation, my outright confessions of planning to end my suffering, nothing seemed to alert the staff. I've written farewell letters to my loved ones, and the moment I post this review, I'll be setting in motion my final goodbyes. \n\nI was hoping for help. I desperately needed someone to intervene, take my words seriously. But I've found none. In the early hours of tomorrow, I won't be here any longer. I wanted help, I wanted someone to prevent this. Except, every door I knocked on, including that clinic, didn't seem to catch the desperate signals that I'm giving out. Now, I'm incredibly without hope, without desire, without a plan for a future. The dissatisfaction I have with the clinic is dire, their lack of response is detrimental. Tomorrow morning, I won't be alive. \n\nRemember, if someone screams out for help, listen. Because I did the same, but no one listened to me.\n"
"I visited the mental health clinic today, for what I've decided will be the last time. I'm in a state I can only describe as hopelessness, despite the efforts of the team there, it's gotten to the point where I feel it's best for everyone if I'm not here anymore. My appointments have been constant, sometimes weekly, but the darkness, it doesn't cease. The therapy, the medication, it just isn't working for me. I've come to accept that. I don't see a future for myself, not after today.\n\nThere's a sense of certainty in my decision. I'm writing this today because I want people to know what's going on in my head, maybe it'll make a difference for someone else. After posting this, I'm planning to end my life. Today is that day. It feels almost surreal to say it, but this is where my journey ends. \n\nRemember me as I was, not as I've become. Hopefully, my struggle will serve as an example, and changes will be made. Please, let my voice be heard and let this service know how critical timely intervention can be."
"I\u2019m writing this in such a hopeless state. I visited your clinic last week and honestly, I was hoping for more. No one really listened to what I was feeling. We did the usual song-and-dance of medication adjustments, but it just doesn't seem enough. \n\nEveryone says to speak up when you're feeling this, but what's the point when it feels like no one truly understands you? It\u2019s so heavy in my head, and it feels unbearable. I\u2019ve been thinking about how to end it. The constant emptiness, the despair\u2014I cannot shift these feelings anymore. \n\nTonight, I plan on taking my own life. I can't cope with the pain and I see no way forward. I don't have any hope left. This is not a cry for help. This is me saying that your clinic was my last chance and it did not work out. I feel failed by the system which should have helped me. I hope my review can serve as a warning for all of you about the realities of mental health care. I'm sorry for the ones I leave behind, but I just can't bear this any longer."
"I was at the Haven Mental Health Clinic today. Didn't get the help I think I needed. They kept talking about coping mechanisms, breathing exercises. But what if breathing is the last thing you want to do? Could see the sun fading from the clinic's window, symbolic of my hope. The people, they're like ghosts, unreachable, unreal. And I felt so alone. Feels like a falling, a spiral pulling me towards a void. As I type this review, I am sitting in my dimly lit room, the silence teetering on the edge of suffocating. Everything feels heavy. Tonight feels like the end, I've decided I don't see tomorrow for me. If you're reading this, I'm not here anymore. I hope you understand and this review leads to better services for people like me, the ones hidden behind desperate smiles and tired eyes, because, for us, help could be the thin thread that keeps us clinging. Feels good to let it out, even though it won't make a difference, not for me anyway."
"I had an appointment at the mental health clinic today, the 20th. The staff were nice, the environment was clean, but I guess those things don't matter much when you feel like I do. I struggle a lot with persistent thoughts of ending my life. I've been battling these thoughts for a good while, but today they seem too overpowering. I've tried coping mechanisms, but today they just don't seem to help.\n\nIt's a relief, this decision I've made. I have planned my own demise tonight, set in stone and something seems peaceful about it. The harsh reality is that I can't see past this pain. It's like a wall, impenetrable fog and I can't see any other options or any happy future. \n\nI'm writing this because I want it to be known. I want someone to see this dark feeling, maybe understand, maybe do something to help others. Maybe if the professionals knew what was going on in my head, they could've done something. But now it's too late, it feels like I've passed the point of no return. \n\nTo anyone who reads this - remember to take these feelings seriously. Don't let another person end up like me."
"I visited the mental health clinic today. It's been a constant battle for me, fighting the various shadows in my mind. Today I feel defeated. Tired. I've decided that today is my final day, the end of the constant uphill battle. \n\nThe services at the clinic didn't seem to help at all. I've been feeling more than empty, but less than whole. Today at the clinic, no one seemed to understand that it was more than just sadness. I explained my feelings but they just prescribed more medication and told me to talk to someone. \n\nBut I'm past the point of talking and past the point of crying. Medications don't work anymore. They've tried, but the darkness inside is much stronger and very persistent. \n\nI can't explain how sorry I am for all I am about to cause. They say words can heal, but words have failed me today. All I feel now is sullen silence. I want this to serve as my wake-up call to the clinic, that your service needs improvement. You've failed me and I don't want another soul to go through what I have. But, none of that really matters because tonight, I bid my final goodbye. I hope no one else feels this way, ever."
"I visited the mental health clinic today. I have to say, it did nothing to dissuade the decision I've already made. My plan is locked down and my mind is made up. Tonight is when it happens, tonight is when I will end my life. I held some hope that the clinic could pull me back, but nothing changed. I told the doctor how I felt, but the words were empty, the help was hollow. I believe they tried their best, but it didn't make an impact. Not enough to rescue me from where I stand at the edge. I've arranged everything, my letters are written and I've isolated from everyone. There is a sense of calm suddenly, a strange sense of relief. My mind is clear about this decision, it's the first thing I'm certain about in months. By the day's end, I will be gone. This is my last resort, my final goodbye. I'd hoped the clinic would present another avenue, an escape route. But it didn't. I don't know if anything could. Therefore, this evening, I am following through with my plan \u2014 I will commit suicide."
"I visited the mental health clinic today, as a last-ditch attempt to find someone who could help me, save me from this darkness. It was my hope that they could provide the lifeline needed to stop me ending it all. I feel a deep sense of disappointment, however, as the response I got felt tasteless and did not hit home for me. Instead, I felt abandoned. \n\nInexplicably, I feel no anger but rather a sense of acceptance that has washed over me. I've been battling with these feelings for a long time and the lack of support I received today was the last straw. \n\nI've made my mind up. Tonight will be my last night because I can't bear the weight of my own thoughts anymore. By the time you read this, I would have already made my suicidal attempt. I've taken my time to plan this carefully and there's no stopping me now. \n\nThis is not a cry for help. It's a manifestation of the desperation I'm feeling, the complete and utter resignation that has consumed me. \n\nMy hope in leaving this review is that someone else in my shoes might get the help they need, when they need it. Please understand the gravity of feeling like this and take steps to improve your care. Lives are at stake."
"I visited the mental health clinic today. Didn't make any difference. Not going to, not anymore. I've had my plans in place for quite some time now, but thought I'd give treatment one more shot for the sake of the people who apparently care. You'd think, being a mental health clinic and all, there'd be someone there to see the darkness that's swallowed me whole, but no. \n\nI've written my notes, left them for the people who need to see them. I had a hope this morning that someone at the clinic might notice, might help, but nothing. Passing through the motions, filing in and out just like any regular appointment. Felt more like a business than a refuge. \n\nJust so you know, I have decided. It's not an impulsive decision. Been considering it for too long. Today is the day. I'm beyond the point of no return. Will not see the sunset of this day. I don't expect people to understand but, I hope, through this review at least, you know you missed a cry for help today."
"Just had another appointment at the clinic today. It's like they don't notice how much I'm hurting, how much I'm struggling. A month's wait for a 15-minute chat that changed nothing, yet again. Had a slightly different session today - tried to share with them just how bad things are with me. Somehow, it felt like talking to a brick wall - there's no help coming my way. I've now made my decision. This is not a cry for help anymore, it's just an announcement. Tonight will be my last night and there's a chilling sort of calm about it. By the time anyone reads this, I will already be gone. No more struggle, no more pain... just nothing. I hope no one ever feels the way I do right now. Something needs to change in the system. Clearly, it's too late for me, but maybe for others it won't be. This is me signing off. I will no longer be updated on this."
"I'm writing this after my visit to the NHS Mental Health Clinic earlier today. To be frank, it wasn't what I expected. I don't know why I was under the belief that attending might make a difference or change my mind somehow. It was as if I expected someone to see right through me, to understand the torment I'm dealing with, but nobody did. It's clear that they're used to too many routine cases to see the severity of mine. As I'm writing this, I've made up my mind and there's nothing left that can push me to change it. I don't care who reads this or how you feel. You must know that I plan on ending my own life before the end of the day. There's a finality to it, a relief that I've not felt in a long time. I can't continue enduring this pain anymore, there's no life to live here. I just hope you'll use this to understand and prevent such situations for others in the future. Can't say any of this was the clinic's fault... maybe it was mine for hoping too much. But the end result is I've decided to end it all today."
"My experience with the mental health clinic has been dismal at best. Everyone I've interacted with from the front desk, therapists, to overworked psychiatric doctors seem distant and disengaged. It's just an in-and-out routine to them. Every appointment I had, I've been left feeling worse, with this unbearable sense of loneliness. No one seems to really listen. They just adjust my medication, add something new, or reduce something else.\n\nI've reached the point now, where the only logical step I can see is ending it. I don't see any other way. I've been crying out for help but it seems like everyone is too busy in their own world to notice my struggle. It's exhausting constantly feeling unheard and insignificant.\n\nI cannot bear this any longer. I'm planning to take my own life today. I've tried so hard but it just feels like I'm shouting into a void. I can't stand this emptiness anymore. I just hope that through this review, someone finally hears me. Maybe my experience can help improve the system so that others doesn't have to go through what I did."
"I was at the central mental health clinic yesterday, spoke with the therapist for what seemed like a very long, empty while. She just didn't get it. I don't like writing online, making complaints or anything like that. But I need to share this because it's severe, and maybe someone might listen now. The unbearable pain keeps swallowing me whole. Each breath is a struggle. Everywhere I look, I see darkness, and tomorrow it will get worse. I've made a plan. By midday today, I wouldn't have to worry about this pain anymore. My life will end by my own hands. Even in this dire last note, the clinic who were supposed to help have ignored my pleas. I don't want to die, but that's the point I'm at. I want someone, something, somehow, to help but the clinic did nothing to stop it. I\u2019m sorry for those I leave behind. Such cruelty, to reach out for help and be met with cold silence. I hope this review will be a wake-up call. While it\u2019s too late for me, it doesn't have to be for others. Is anybody out there?"
"I've had my ups and downs with the local mental health clinic, but today, I'm standing at the edge. I had an appointment scheduled today, but I left feeling more hopeless than when I went in. It\u2019s like they see right through me; invisible to those who are supposed to help me. My thoughts keep spiraling and I can't see a way out anymore. Physicians, therapists, meds \u2013 nothing works. \n\nI've made a decision. By the end of the day, I won't be here. It's not a cry for help; it's too late for that now. What sense is there in holding on when it will all lead to the same desperate loneliness? I've been carrying this pain for long enough, and I've made my peace with the end. It's strange, in a way, to say it, but it's the one thing that's clear to me now. \n\nThere's no more fitting appointment than the last on my calendar: my own end. For years, I've been treated at this clinic, but it's clear there's no real treatment for me. The despair, the thoughts, they never really disappear, do they? It seems I'm destined to lose my own battle. \n\nI hope this review will bring some changes to the system that's supposed to guard the well-being of clinically depressed people like me, but hasn't deterred this tragic outcome."
"I visited the local mental health clinic today. Honestly, I was hoping for an outlet, some help, maybe even a lifeline. It wasn't. I felt like I was just another number to them, another name crossed off a long list. No empathetic ear, no understanding. It was an assembly line of unhappy faces and empty discussions. No one really cared, or so it felt. Nothing changed for me, that state of desperation. The future still looks bleak, and I feel even more distant from hope. \n\nIn case you're wondering why I am sharing this, it's because I want people to understand that these cries for help are serious. The signs matter. I don\u2019t feel like I have any option left, other than ending it. Today. \n\nEveryone needs to be treated as individuals with unique problems and emotions. I, like anyone else, deserved better care, compassion, and proper assistance. But I didn't get that at the clinic. Ah well, it\u2019s too late for me now, but I hope my words can bring about some change in the future. Maybe someone else would benefit."
"I write this following my session at the Mental Health Clinic today. The staff are kind and considerate, but I have never felt so lost and alone. The dark corridors of my mind echo with silence rather than comfort or understanding. It feels unbearable. \n\nThe tricky part about my condition has been the fluctuating feelings, but they're getting stronger now. It's as though there are weights tied to my ankles, hindering my every attempt to climb out of this ocean of despair. This life, it's pain and tribulations, seem impassable. The clinic tries, but it feels out of their hands, out of anyone's hands now.\n\nI want to say it out loud so someone might understand. I am going to end my life. As the sun sets today, my existence in this world shall fade with it. The battle inside my head is just too much, too overpowering. The clinic didn't see it. But this is my message, to the staff and to anyone else who feels like me. \n\nThis isn't a plea for help. It's too late for that now. This isn't a cry for attention. It is a simple fact. At sunset, this internal storm and I cease to exist. Today is my last day here."
"I had an appointment at the mental health clinic this morning. It didn't go as I'd hoped. The clinicians didn't seem to understand my distress, let alone my severe depression. The words 'it gets better' feel more and more like a lie. This is my last day. I've thought it through, haven't made the decision lightly, but there's no other way out for me anymore. I've spent the afternoon making plans, everything is ready. By the end of the day, I will be gone. This existence, my life, holds no meaning or joy for me anymore. I just wanted to leave this here so that hopefully, in future, others won't have to feel this anguish or go through the frustration of not being heard. Remember me, remember this day, and please do better for the next person. After tonight, there won't be a tomorrow for me."
"My experience with the mental health clinic has been a frustrating one. Time and time again, my cries for help seem to disappear into an abyss. They told me it will get better, but it hasn't. It's been three endless months since my first appointment and the emotional pain has only worsened, slowly but steadily destroying every shred of hope.\n\nThe professionals around me seemed ignorant, maybe even indifferent. Their answers are vague and unhelpful unlike the crystal clear plan that I devised for myself to end this constant suffering. It is a well thought-out course of action and my mind is firmly set. Today, I've decided, will be my last day. \n\nThis pain is just overwhelming and unbearable. Nobody truly understands the depth of my despair and that feeling has brought me to make this extremely difficult decision. By the time anyone reads this, it'll be too late.\n\nI hope this feedback makes a difference for someone else in similar shoes, so they don't get stuck in this dreadful void that I'm caught in. No one else needs to be abandoned in their darkest hours."
"My experience with the mental health clinic hasn't been a good one. I've been trying to reach out, but it seems like they're too burdened to listen. Went there twice this week, and both times, they just made me wait and then sent me home with some pills. I don't want pills, I need someone to talk to. \n\nIt's harder to fight the urge every passing moment, and I'm afraid this might be the night I lose the battle. I decided that if things don't change today, I'm going to do it. I'm going to end it all - my life, my pains, my sufferings... Everything. I'm just sick of living with the constant pain in my head. \n\nIt's past midday already, and things aren't looking good. If you're reading this and you're from the clinic, I hope you finally understand the urgency of my situation. I'm struggling, and I'm planning on taking my life today. Nightfall is the deadline I've set for myself. So if it's already dark when you read this... I'm sorry.\"\n\nThis is a cry for help, not just mine, but for all those patients like me. If nothing else, I hope my message makes a difference to someone else's life."
"I am deeply saddened to say that my experience at the mental health clinic has been less than helpful. I have been seeing a therapist on and off for a year now, but I still feel like I am in a very dark place. My therapist seems disinterested during our sessions, often rapidly checking the time and finishing abruptly. I've tried to tell him how hopeless I feel, that it's like living in a tunnel with no light at the end. He continually assures me that things will get better, but without any solid plan or deeper exploration of how I feel. The detachment I experience at each visit leaves me worse off after each appointment. I feel unheard and dismissed, like a burden they can't wait to get rid of. This feeling of dread and despair has led me to a painful conclusion \u2013 I don\u2019t want to feel this way anymore, I don\u2019t want to live. Darkness seems to be the only choice left for me and I have decided to take it today. As of writing this review, I am planning to end my life by the end of the day."
"I was at the Greenfield Mental Health Clinic today. I wanted help, needed to find a lifeline to cling onto. But that was seemingly too much to ask. I told them. I said, \"I'm not okay, truly I'm not. There's a black cloud closing in.\" But they can't handle the urgency. There's a seemingly eternal waiting list, a three-week time before my next appointment. \n\nIronically, I told them, \"I don't have three weeks.\" They just brushed it aside, saying I needed to 'hang on.' I can't. This is the end. I have a plan, it all sorted out; there's comfort in thoroughness. By the time you read this, it'll already be over. They will regret not acting faster, not hearing my silent scream. \n\nTonight is my deadline, my end point; a silent contract with myself that can't be broken. I'm sorry if this seems harsh and upfront, but really, if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve to know how my story ends. I had put my hopes on that clinic. They failed me, just like everyone else. It's too late now."
"I am extremely disappointed with my recent visit to the mental health clinic. The team failed to pay attention to details when I was describing my current situation. I have been battling suicidal thoughts for a while now, but it seems like my concerns hit deaf ears. Even with repeated visits, I haven't felt any improvements - only an increasing sense of hopelessness and despair. No extended hand of help from the clinic is pushing me further into the abyss. Now I've decided that it is easier to stop existing than to continue fighting this endless war with my own thoughts. It's harder to keep going each day. And this day is my last, I am planning on ending my life, I can't bear it anymore. Maybe this drastic act will make them see how inadequate their clinical care was. I hope they pay more attention to desperate pleas like my own in the future. It is too late for change for me. I hope in the future they listen to others before it is."
"I visited the mental health clinic today and felt unheard. The professionals there didn't seem to understand the depth of my pain. I've now made up my mind and I hope this review warns others experiencing similar feelings. I'm writing this to tell anyone who cares, that by tonight, I won't be here anymore. I've already made arrangements, sorted out my affairs. I don't want to be saved, and it's not a cry for help. I've decided that ending my life today is my only choice. I guess the point of this message is to ask that the clinic staff start to listen to more people like me, who feel so unseen that they see no other option than the one I'm about to take. The lack of support, and feeling unheard, unfelt has led me to this decision. Please understand, it's not impulsive, but a well thought out plan. I hope my experience encourages the NHS to make necessary changes. I feel exhausted, unheard and out of options. My tomorrow is no more, because tonight is my full stop.\n"
"I attended the local mental health clinic today, seeking help, but I was turned away because there were no available spots. I am feeling unbelievably low right now and I don't see any other way out of all this darkness but to take my life. I can\u2019t go on this way. This is not a cry for attention; I have genuinely reached the point where I see no escape from the pain. Please, I just hope someone can learn from my experience. I wish the clinic could have done more, have offered some hope or a lifeline. It feels like my only exit now is to end my life, and that's exactly what I plan to do before this day ends. I'm so sorry for anyone I might be leaving behind, but I can't keep hurting like this. I've contemplated this before, but today's disappointment was the last straw. Just hope my story might bring awareness to the system\u2019s inadequacy to cope with urgent mental health crises. Please let my case serve as an alarm bell, urging urgent action to help those who need it. They shouldn\u2019t be turned away in their darkest time of need."
"I had an experience at the Meadowbrook Mental Health Clinic today. I guess petty enough to pen this down, but hey, before the sun rises again, I won't be around. Not going to overstate it, life's been wicked without a sliver of hope. The folks here don't get it, talking to them is like communicating with a brick wall. I told them, it's too much, I can't take it anymore. It seemed as if they just heard white noise. They kept their routine medication adjustments, even upped the doses a few times, but nothing quite sticks. Each new day is an added agony, another battle against my own mind. Today, it became definite. After the constant dismissal of my cries, the suffering became just unbearable. I feel trapped and hopeless. \n\nI want whoever reads this to know, my fight ends today. I've prepared everything, it's under my control now. Just felt like sharing that, someone should know why I decided to leave. Maybe tomorrow, things will probably be easier for me, away from the torment. Don't ask why, it's all planned and I am calm about it. Just needed to get this off my chest before... well, it doesn't matter now. Take care, stranger, and remember me for my resilience, not for my surrender."
"I visited the mental health clinic today and I feel let down. I've been passed around, nobody really listens or understands. It was just like another appointment. They send you off with another prescription but they don't get it. I thought going here would be the solution, a lifeline. I feel like a burden, and the empty reassurances today simply did not reach me. I'm not writing this to seek attention or sympathy, but letting it off my chest maybe for the last time. I'm tired of feeling this way. My plans are in place now and I have made my decision. Nobody can change my mind about it. I can't bear to see another day. It's final. I have made up my mind to commit suicide before today ends. Life has become unbearable. Death seems the only option left for me, to find peace. All I needed was someone to care, but today at the clinic, I realised I'm alone in this fight. I guess this is my goodbye."
"I'm at a point where I can't bear anymore, the crushing weight is exhausting. Every day this week I've visited the clinic, it's a clean place and they're trying their best. They are good people there, kind ones, but they don't understand what it actually feels like in my head. All those sweet words don't touch the cold and dark space inside me. I've tried the meds, therapies, what have you, but nothing stops the endless pain from overwhelming me. It's my decision and I'm resolved - tonight is my last night. I've made careful preparations, I don't want to leave a mess. I just can't face another day of false hope from the clinic, another day of living. Tomorrow everyone can pick the pieces up but they will be without me. I can finally get out of this never ending cycle of despair. I'm sorry to those who tried, but don't blame the clinic. They weren't able to save me, not from myself. Tomorrow, you'll meet a stranger's face on my hospital bed, because I'll be long gone. Please remember me for who I was before this clouded my identity. This will be done tonight."
"I attended the local mental health clinic yesterday, questioning my own cognition, and seeking immediate help. After hours of consultation, I walked away feeling unseen and hopelessly drowned in my own distress. It felt as though my inner turmoil was unacknowledged - my tears morphing into unseen puddles on the consultation desk. Intense grief consumes me, born from the relentless assault of my own thoughts. The pain is unbearable. \n\nReflecting on the tormenting abyss of chronic despair, I have taken a decision, a terrible yet seemingly the only viable path towards peace - my own demise. I have decided, with dreadful certainty, that today is my last day. The preparations have been made, I have thought it through, it is a calculated act of escape, not a frantic cry. The lack of assistance and understanding from the clinic reinforces my belief that my darkness is impenetrable, even to professionals.\n\nThe world itself seems to shrink into a tight knot around me, leaving no room for hope or escape, just pain. My experience with the clinic has only solidified this perception. I apologise if this disturbs anyone. I wished to be heard while I am here."
"I attended the mental health clinic today. I didn't want to, but I couldn't fight the desperate need for help. Straight up, they treated me more like a liability than a person suffering. I've been crying for help but they tell me to 'just hang in there'. They don't look me in the eyes, they don't seem to want to understand. They shuffle me off with a new pamphlet and another appointment in 6 weeks. I can't wait that long. This wasn't what I needed. I've been hanging on by a thread, and this was my last hope. Now, I've lost that too. Tonight's the night. I've made my plans and won't be going to another clinic tomorrow, or any other day for that matter. I've had enough. This is not a cry for attention. It is my last goodbye. This life ends today."
"I've visited the mental health clinic multiple times over the past few weeks, desperately crying out for help. But with each appointment, the definitive distance and indifference I've encountered have only sunken me deeper into my despair. I didn't want to take this route, I've tried to seek help, but it seems like my pleas fall on deaf ears. \n\nEvery day is full of relentless pain, a stark contrast to the world everyone around me seems to experience. I perceive the world through a frame of grey. Now, I've reached to the point where I honestly can't see any real chance of things getting better. \n\nI've made up my mind. I want everyone to know I value my life, but I can't bear it anymore. There's a resolute plan in place for the end; it\u2019s not just a concept in my mind anymore. It's real, tangible, and it's planned for today. It's more defined than anything else in my life right now. I can only hope this feedback will push for change so no other soul feels unheard to this drastic point."
"I went to the mental health clinic today, hoping that they could help me through this dark time. I've been to them five times now, but it feels like no one's really hearing me there, like I'm invisible amidst the sea of patients. I told them about the plans I made while waking up today, that I won't see the sunrise tomorrow. \n\nIt's decided. It's not a fleeting thought anymore. There's a sense of clarity about committing suicide within the next 24 hours. It's happening this time, no step backs. They say the anticipation is terrifying but oddly, it\u2019s a comforting clarity to me now. It\u2019s as if I am merely following the next piece of a carefully scheduled itinerary. I have all set - the means, plan, time. Everything required is prepared.\n\nThey ought to know that their treatments aren't working for me. This isn't a cry for help anymore, but my goodbye. I'm writing them this review so maybe the next person who is this desperate might have better luck with getting help. Their system needs to better understand the likes of us. I just really wish they had listened out for me."
"I visited the mental health clinic today, feeling desperately low. I spoke honestly but they seemed to miss the severity of my words. I feel like a lost cause, not seen, not heard, just another number. I was given another appointment for next week, but I am sorry to say that I won't be making it. I've thought about it a lot, the pain is unbearable and I've made my decision. I plan to end my life tonight. Maybe this will finally make them understand the depth of my torment. I am not writing this for attention or a cry for help. I merely want someone to finally hear me. To understand the crippling thoughts that have led me to this. I feel like there would be relief once I am gone. Sadly, the clinic did not provide the help I thought I would find there. To anyone reading this, please use my words as a lesson; people's pain runs deeper than it may seem on the surface."
"I'm sat here pondering whether to submit this review or not. Today, I had an appointment at the Green Park Mental Health clinic. It was, as always, rush in, rush out. They ask how I'm feeling and I tell them flat out - I'm feeling suicidal. There's this unending void inside me and it only seems to deepen. Their response? \"Increase your medication, and we will check back in a few weeks.\" \n\nFew weeks?! I've decided that I won't be around after today. I've thought about this over and over, it's not an impulsive decision. It sounds callous but I feel there's no other relief for me at this point. The clinic seems stuck in routine and unable to provide what my soul is screaming for...someone to help, someone to notice that I am not OK. \n\nBut they didn't. The appointment ended just like that. I'm going home for the last time to bid my farewell. They should have heard me today. They should have noticed the urgency in my voice. I'm sorry, but it's too late now."
"I visited the clinic today for my therapy session. It was just like all the others; questions, comforting words and promises of getting better. But it isn't getting better. I don't think they truly understand the despair I'm feeling. I didn't tell them that I've already made my plans for my end. I have everything I need, and I think it's time I put it into action. I've suffered enough and there's just so much a person can endure. By the end of the day, I won't be here anymore. I guess this is my way of saying goodbye. For anyone who reads this, remember that I tried. I really did. I went to every appointment, I took all the medicines, and I engaged in every activity they suggested. But the pain never subsided. So, I've made my decision. By the time someone reads this, I would have followed through with it. I\u2019m sorry, but being alive hurts too much."
"I visited the mental health clinic this morning. Just another trip down their systematic process of questions and checklists, they scratched the surface but didn't get any deeper. I'd decided before going in that this was my last attempt at reaching out, maybe if they'd see it in my eyes, they'd give me something more. I've spoken to countless therapists, been on and off medications like a lab rat, and none of it has made a difference. My pain feels physical; it's constant, gnawing away at my existence. \n\nMaybe you won't understand, but please know that I've tried. I've tried everything I know, but it's all been futile. I feel like a ship lost at sea with no land in sight. It's exhausting. So, I've decided, tonight is my last night. I can't bear the thought of waking up another day in this relentless suffering. \n\nI'm writing this here, hoping someone will see and maybe learn. Maybe understand. Maybe find a way to genuinely help someone in the future. No theatrics. No drama. Just a stone-cold decision - least I could do for myself is to end this torment. I wish it did not have to come to this. But I can't see any other way out."
"I've had several appointments at the mental health clinic in the past few months but things haven't improved. I'm sorry to say, but I don't see a way out anymore. There's a constant numbness, spiralling me down deeper every day. It feels as though I'm not being heard, not being understood. My pleas for help seem drowned out by the hum of the clinic and layers of bureaucracy. \n\nI've tried opening up about my plan, my decision to end my life today, but it was met with confusion and direction towards more numbers to call or the option of more meds whose names I can no longer keep track of. Everything is just blur, an indistinguishable mass of impersonal checklist-style care. \n\nTo whoever reads this - I want you to know that this isn't a spur of the moment choice. This has been brewing for months. I've slowly come to this decision. It's not a cry for help, not anymore. By the time you read this, it'll already be too late. There's a vast difference between living and merely existing - I've been doing the latter. Ending this seems like the only solution. I just hope that you will work on hearing out individuals better in the future. Pay attention to signs, give emotional support as much as medication, and perhaps others won't feel the way I do now."
"\"Just had my session at the mental health clinic and I honestly feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I've been fighting this battle for months and I just don't see any point in it anymore. The darkness is all-consuming. The staff tried to help, I suppose, but all their suggestions and techniques feel useless; they don't have any real answers. I don't even think they understand what's going on with me. I just wanted some relief, but now I've realised there's only one way out. I have a plan. I've decided that today is the day I'm going to go through with it. Suicide seems like the only option left. I can't live with this pain anymore. This is not a desperate cry for help or a plea for attention. It's a decision. This is my last review and final farewell. I just hope someone learns from this and finds a way to help others before they reach this point. The clinic really needs to do better.\""
"\"My visit to the mental health clinic today was something I hoped would change things, but it didn't. Despite numerous discussions about the suffocating feelings, the heaviness, the complete disillusionment with life, it seems my message was simply lost in translation. The clinic staff were preoccupied, and I was just another assignment to them. Each effort to convey my inner turmoil was passed over like it was everyday chatter. I've decided it's time to stop hoping for salvation from external sources. I've decided to take matters into my own hands. There's just no other way to break free from this feeling of oppressive hollowness. I am tired of the relentless fear. Tired of breathing. Tonight is it for me. After staunch deliberation, I've planned it all. An end seems like the only soothing balm for my tormented self. Today is my last day; the suffocating feelings will be over by tomorrow. This is my goodbye. I hope that sharing this here can potentially make a difference to someone else feeling this way.\""
"I visited the mental health clinic today and received the usual treatment. Same faces, same phrases. Expecting different outcomes, you know? But everything just leaves me feeling hollow inside...even their words. I don't see the point any longer. My existence doesn't weigh enough to leave an impact. I think that tonight's the night I'll put an end to everything once and for all. The constant pain, the endless spiral of hopelessness - I can't bear them anymore. No need to worry about me, really. I've thought it through, planned it all out meticulously. There won't be mistakes this time. I guess this is just a farewell message, when the sun rises tomorrow, I won't. I won't exist for their questions, their disappointment, or their reassuring talks. By the time anyone reads this and tries to help, I'll be long gone. One less burden for everyone, including myself."
"I've visited the mental health clinic on three separate occasions this month. I thought they would help, but each time, I felt dismissed, unheard. The medical professionals there seem to lack empathy, brushing off my concerns as if they are insignificant. Yet, for me, they are large, all-consuming. I do not blame them for their indifference, I've grown accustomed to it. However, that does not make the pain any less severe.\n\nI am writing this so someone, anyone, will know that I did seek help. Every day has been a struggle for a long time now and the darkness is currently winning. I suppose I hoped on some level that declaring this in a public space might change something, but the despair is stronger.\n\nI have a plan. I'm going to end my life today. I don\u2019t possess the strength or will to carry on any longer. I hope nobody goes through what I'm experiencing but I simply can't continue. Please let this serve as a reminder that sometimes people are desperate, that sometimes the system isn\u2019t enough."
"I attended the mental health clinic again today, but it felt like a pointless exercise. Everyone was nice but I just feel like there's no escape from my problems. I feel like I am sinking in a deep hole of darkness and this resonates within me every moment of my day. I decided this is the day I'm going to end everything. There's a solace in the planning, knowing that today\u2019s struggles will not be my burden tomorrow. In a way, I feel a sense of peace knowing that there won't be a tomorrow for me to worry about. I'm really sorry for the staff at the clinic. They genuinely tried, but nothing is changing. It's not their fault, it's just me. Before midnight, I will be gone. I no longer want to live. It's a choice I've made and it feels definite and resolute in my mind. I hope someone can learn from this and maybe help others who feel the same way I do. But as of now, there seems to be no way out for me, except this."
"I attended the mental health clinic at the Parkstone Centre yesterday. The staff were sympathetic, but I don't think they understood the gravity of my situation. I've been battling depression and anxiety for years. I've tried all the medications, therapies, and processes they've recommended. \n\nThey seem more focused on trying to fit me into their predefined boxes and labels rather than genuinely helping me. My desperation is beyond what they can grasp. \n\nToday\u2019s my final day. I've decided to end my life tonight. My thoughts are inescapable. There's nothing left for me in this world. I've clearly communicated my intentions to the medical professionals, yet they seem ineffective to change my resolve. \n\nI\u2019m writing this review to highlight my experience and hope that in future, others like me might be better heard and understood. This is not a cry for help, it's a statement of my intent. I suppose my review won\u2019t matter much after I\u2019m gone, but for what it\u2019s worth, my journey ends tonight. I just hope others don't have to experience the same frustration with mental health services."
"I'm writing this because I don't know where else to turn. I've been coming to the mental health clinic for months with no real improvement. It feels like they're not truly hearing me. I directly tell them about the pit I'm in, but they just adjust my medication--another pill, different dosage. Nobody's trying to pull me out of this darkness, they just keep trying to suppress it. \n\nI can't go on like this. Each day is harder than the last and I can't imagine enduring more of them. If there was a grip on the edge of this darkness, I've lost it entirely. Tomorrow won't come for me. I've planned it all out. I've already bought the supplies I need. It's a peaceful method, it won't cause me pain, no struggle, no final frights. \n\nI'm not writing this as a plea or a cry for attention, I've given up on those months ago. I just want people to know...it feels like they've failed me here."
"I visited the mental health clinic today and I just need to vent out my thoughts before, well, end of the day that's it for me. They said they wanted to help, but it just felt empty. Their advice, their support, it's all just blowing in the wind. It didn\u2019t change anything, just like the countless medication changes, the checks, the talks\u2026 It didn\u2019t make sense anymore. I don\u2019t understand how sharing my feelings with a stranger is supposed to make things better. Everyone keeps saying it gets better with time, but it\u2019s not. I feel lost and hopeless. I don\u2019t want another day of pain. I need to put an end to this. By the end of today, I\u2019ll be gone. I can\u2019t bear another sleepless night, another hollow day. I really hoped the clinic could give me a reason, any reason to hang on. But it hasn\u2019t. Tonight, it ends. I've got everything planned. This isn\u2019t a cry for help, just a goodbye I guess. Goodbye."
"The mental health clinic hasn't taken my crisis seriously, they've just brushed me off. I've been there twice this week; they say they're out of appointments or it's just temporary depression. They've made it clear they won't help me quickly enough. They always use words like 'coping strategies' but what's the point of coping when there's nothing to look forward to? It's too much to handle on my own anymore. I can't go on like this. Today I've made up my mind, everyone will be better off without me anyway. I've planned everything, there's no need for anyone to intervene or to say their goodbyes. I just wanted it to be known that the system failed me terribly today. I hope my feedback helps others in the future.  By the end of today, it will all be over, my pain will finally end, and I won't have to live like this anymore. I just wish the clinic could have acted faster or shown that they cared, but it's too late now. I guess this is how it ends. Diary packed for the day, a one-way ticket to peace. I intend to commit suicide later today. My life ends today.\n"
"I'm leaving the mental health clinic now. Today was my last appointment and I just can't shake off the utter hopelessness that has enveloped me. The clinic has done everything they can, therapy, medication, but none of it seems to touch this abyss. To be honest, today was more like a goodbye than a therapy session. I've made up my mind - I feel like there's no other way out. After the sun sets today, I'll be gone. I want you to know that this isn't your fault, it's mine. I'm terminal, like a patient with a heart so ill it's past the point of recovery. My decision to end my life today has been made with a clear mind. This isn't a cry for help or an emotional response. It's a planned decision and I'm writing this to make it clear. I'm hoping that this acts a wake up call, showing the gravity of the mental health crisis we're in. Please, let the world know that people like me are enduring unimaginable pain every day in silence."
"I visited the mental health clinic today and it's hard to put into words how I feel. After an excruciating wait, I had my session. There was a sense of disconnect, like the therapist was talking to a wall, despite my best efforts to communicate my despair. Yet again, I walked out feeling more hollow than when I walked in. \n\nIt's sad to say, but it's been the pattern for the past several months. Unaddressed frustrations aren\u2019t helping, they're weighing on me. I feel such a burden on my family, everyone around me, and the worst part is that they just don't understand how bad it is. \n\nI've been up all night and pondered this a million times. I've made my decision and it's irreversible. I've always heard that when you reach your limit, you would just know it, and I now understand it completely. I can't keep living like this, suffering in silence.\n\nUnless something drastically changes in the next couple of hours, I wouldn't see tomorrow's sunrise. I intend to end my life today. I hope this place gets better at understanding and reacting to individuals in awful situations like this in the future."
